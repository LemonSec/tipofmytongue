1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,339
alright that's right I'll switch over to
you directly and we're actually on time

2
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:08,269
so it's perfect

3
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:15,580
ok that's no stress thank you thanks so
when presenting today I wonder how many

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,789
of you are hungry they operate or so
have you can raise your hands just

5
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:29,990
wonder ok so I so many people hopeful
you so I'm pursuing something really

6
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:41,300
through a PRS it's a protocol in ham
radio let's say that you doing ok about

7
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:51,750
myself I think it's important not hard
to talk too much about yourself by to

8
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:58,100
call yourself a legal turning into a 1.5
years completely unrelated things with

9
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,460
the frequencies of teaching myself

10
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,540
transmitted soon

11
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:12,330
mostly data in a way that can be done in
an environment with a lot of nice so I'm

12
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,880
interest and weak signal protocols and
things like that

13
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:25,449
ADRs as we will see now it's interesting
because most of the centralized and it

14
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,479
has very solid infrastructure of a
really existence that you can use to

15
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,240
walk as a sex it was developed by these
guide called bob running when he was in

16
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:47,189
Japan he was from aus Navy and she was a
half tactic our system for position

17
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:53,460
reporting or state rules or anything
that poll older people who were honored

18
00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:00,009
by like you would rather soft coverage
from different fasteners what's going on

19
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:05,649
so I will ask to take with a grain of
salt would attack economy has caused

20
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:10,910
many especially ham radio tactical
usually just means you're paying more

21
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,129
money for something that is not
technical or anything like that and see

22
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:19,359
why it's not exactly an affair or
anything like that it's definitely not

23
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:28,660
something you will use much 90037 it's
very exposed to see trivial electronic

24
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:37,579
warfare tactics but the most important
thinks it's a stateless so it's

25
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:43,530
something like UDP over radio frequency
varies absolutely no information kept

26
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,459
within politician assumption that you're
gonna get a response for your package

27
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:53,180
you use broadcast something someone gets
the Packer because stan and then choose

28
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:59,730
what to do with it but there is no
persistence link between two given

29
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:06,859
machines trust me there are still
operating its working with our FAQ's 25

30
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,840
file annoys

31
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,190
arafat is so if you've read about
satellite communications with hammering

32
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:23,790
the satellites or berry O Lantern and
stuff it's basically that one of the

33
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,500
things I was talking about this does its
single channel there is no frequency

34
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,120
hopping fugazi hoping is that you change
frequency during a given time you can

35
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,690
maybe thousands of times for second one
time per second you change your

36
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:46,140
frequencies so that that's a an
adversary cannot jam your transmission

37
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:52,939
on a single channel I completely detect
deter you from using that one example

38
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:59,349
that will be sweating military radio
site being take all at once the program

39
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:07,548
for BHF and I have like 12 channels many
people here have a background in the

40
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:12,090
military in swollen by I guess if you're
old enough you've probably seen them I

41
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,488
think there were 12 channels and they
were BHF the thing is if you have

42
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:20,690
something those free program and those
channels for free program you don't even

43
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:26,469
need to to have wide band jamming
capabilities you just has to a jammer on

44
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:32,190
each of those channels on its cure you
can now use those fuel reviews so with

45
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:38,719
APRs it's basically the same thing it's
also free operators your senior 2004

46
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,889
people and various stable internet
infraction surely we're gonna see leader

47
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:51,840
doing the talk but it's extremely
susceptible to abuse so that brings us

48
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,950
to one considering putting ham radio on
its most things in Camarillo based on

49
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:03,909
assumption of good faith meaning that
you're not going to be a Nashville so if

50
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,630
you're transmitting something which is
what we are going to see later they're

51
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:13,990
going to overlap other people you're not
going to jam this means you're not going

52
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:20,260
to spoof other people but the promise
there is snow offering the controlling

53
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:26,110
what's going on the recent authority in
search of a technical level like the

54
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:31,540
probable does not enforce that way you
can impersonate anybody you can pretty

55
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,130
much trust me whatever you want and all
the limits you is implement a sense of

56
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:41,800
their mother themselves over this
connector and all that paper is very

57
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,360
cheap to implement an emcee use we will
see its a ski show you mine if you go

58
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,700
back to the nineties and that's one
thing also behind radio that you may not

59
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:59,170
have you sold 3.3 that's it's a minute
and capsule back to the times when you

60
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:03,990
have the OP and you know it you'll see
these was the thing I never had this

61
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,730
personal page and everything look like
crap but basically it's like that and

62
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:15,830
the Code Council oak obscene sometimes
it's not up to the standards generally

63
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,550
those expecting on networks Posas over
these days even if you see complete

64
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,729
statesman on all the time

65
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:33,719
this with the axe 25 friend looks like
you're gonna do things mostly

66
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:40,860
destination address and should address
the Arco station IDs like a sea like if

67
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,879
you're working wifi whenever we say six
98 sarcos sign on a closed sign is

68
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:50,409
assigned to you by basically the
government when you get a license so

69
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:56,210
it's in may also qualify for girls radio
tengo whatever you get your so you can

70
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:02,498
get that vanity concentrated on a low
cousins are offensive to you can argue a

71
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:07,759
call for gay or a call for a ground war
costs for whatever I mean anything that

72
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:15,509
they think it's not politically correct
they don't let you have it so that's not

73
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:25,689
enforce its just basically and call your
packet modulated in FM or necessary or

74
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:32,810
whether you're using some more than more
your physical PNC Europe controller just

75
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:39,669
basically so far more than implementing
the hard work and you have the control

76
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:44,909
feel that you I know this static for
APRs and are you having for me some fuel

77
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:52,680
which is what contains a purist they
there and that's a maximum of 255 fun if

78
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,300
you know this its just one single one
binding together which is what you're

79
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:03,740
limited to one in practice packets are
much smaller and then there's one in a

80
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:09,339
pure as packet looks like basically half
a day the type IV which one single

81
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:15,849
character it's all of these asking you
can process it sold text there is no

82
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:20,729
binary specially cuz can now being
called a few saline its to be

83
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:23,419
transformed into our

84
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:28,010
encoding those fishing on its front
wheels via radio frequency link and this

85
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,929
is using AFC team always get salvia
frequency if Cain if you were using

86
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:38,159
other types of Malaysian then you have
Hyderabad rates you have higher speed

87
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,689
it's completely the friend its march
subject to do you need to have space so

88
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:51,170
that's a hard for the money has to be a
specifically developed for other

89
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,880
frequencies keenness just over your
frequencies which means you can play on

90
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,400
a phone you can play it on a handheld
radio basically all those things

91
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:08,459
something like this which its 30 bucks
40 bucks its China made by its

92
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:17,030
reasonably reliable its ability popular
brand if you seen press releases that

93
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:28,850
they often have these rivers because the
order to keep the comment and a POS data

94
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:36,950
will see soon so that's where the
message looks like you're gonna highest

95
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:42,550
the no-call that's not on an exorcist
and station idea that you will use for

96
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:51,500
testing the source and destination no
call an N one call the nine is so simple

97
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,390
it just means that your mobile or
whatever you can pick different symbols

98
00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:00,340
in the killing one can off until you
have the French transmitters on the same

99
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,920
IP so you can have one at home and then
you can have all your mobile and things

100
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:13,069
like that to get to that bites

101
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:20,470
it's basically congestion control
congestion control I say it's not so

102
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,840
much of a connection control because
you're sharing that the channel with

103
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,730
everybody and everybody can overlap your
transmission what he does it prevents

104
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:34,870
you from abusing the system so that the
one node will not relayed your packet

105
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:40,160
across limit the number of knows
precisely because it's a single channel

106
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,709
and that means that if you trust me at
the same time zone as he struck me the

107
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:49,500
most likely the party will not be court
properly so you don't get your single

108
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,720
crossing in your packet across a good
person doesn't get his either so it's

109
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,280
not so much relief module failure
situation and that's what he tries to

110
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,400
prevent in reality that's being worked
out well

111
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:12,120
limits mostly say if you miss we have to
a local area the line number in this

112
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:18,470
case this month to relevant but for a
message it just helps their received

113
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:23,280
display the message the message to us
commit any asking so you can't really

114
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,829
cold or and your script on in down your
spine but that's going to be beautiful

115
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:33,430
you're going to see the new radio your
software in those connected to this is

116
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:42,020
going to be very obvious so I asked
about playing what a few restaurants

117
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:49,340
like it's annoying and maybe it's vessel
to play loud speakers so I'm gonna try

118
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:56,490
to

119
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:13,769
see if you place

120
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:21,910
so I'm kind of glad that we employ a
time slot speakers ok let's go back to

121
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:32,549
you can use an ordeal as the are
excellent as well let's say I T vs take

122
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:37,949
neither I'm sure many people many of you
have probably seen and it's very cheap

123
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:46,689
assets $7.23 frequencies staff at sea
more or less obvious liberal with

124
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:52,849
spending much money now we're going to
get to the interesting bits of course if

125
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:57,209
you have just a month from all man now
exchanging messages among each other

126
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:01,248
with an awesome guy from councils are
never gonna meet in their life it's not

127
00:13:01,249 --> 00:13:05,819
showing thrusting but what's interesting
is if you have this number is connected

128
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:11,709
to each other through internet and most
importantly we have relay team I like in

129
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:16,170
the nineties or even earlier when our
SMTP was open and people really were

130
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,029
running open relay so you can do all
kinds of things was empty but you could

131
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:25,480
even argue since MPPs the centralized
storage mechanism you could use the

132
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,379
balance message yes the store
information as a kind of covert channel

133
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:35,759
things like that it's pretty much back
to the nineties with this your assumed

134
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,569
to be half properly all the time not to
do anything you're not supposed to and

135
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:48,929
of course the human element so let's
look what we have available so one of

136
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:53,249
the things that Internet gateways do is
a breach their trading frequency link

137
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:58,749
with the internet and what that means is
that you gave an internet-connected

138
00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:05,779
terminal though will relay will operate
your packet radio frequency spectrum

139
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:10,800
and its range from any location you're
in the world's probably has some value

140
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,329
or a leading call sign and a passcode
the passcode album is public so you can

141
00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:22,319
generate a pass code for anybody you can
anyone you can select which they were

142
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:29,279
you want to to use for relaying your
packet when I say not fully and truly a

143
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:35,540
decentralized it's because their main
servers so they could tackle on this

144
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:45,519
will take a massive shit rest of the
system especially when you have all the

145
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,579
people and something that is 20 years
old maybe you're changing its bery bery

146
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:57,410
this vehicle so tackling abused in this
case you will not be so easy but still

147
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:05,490
within the realm of possibility of more
technically capable ministry or office

148
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:13,670
of these gateways the differing degrees
over there are you know what Java

149
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:18,110
implementation no he's not publicly
available you have to ask the offered to

150
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:24,379
send it to you and he has some
interesting lyrics by which means it's

151
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:32,829
very disgusting to look at so APRs is
driven by this Finnish guy it's actually

152
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:39,059
really clean it Cincy chic really
because the arena was obscene and

153
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:43,269
underperforming so he couldn't he knew I
could do more soon server to run of

154
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:48,089
stuff and he's running their the C
version of a story part for telling all

155
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:53,240
the traffic in Phelan they were under
rules with a soft money some of them is

156
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:59,329
basically your demo leonore processing
the signals you to india spins off work

157
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:05,670
and unless you have access to the APRs
per cent packard's because it's

158
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,759
connected all the Gateway something like
that and report back to her to network

159
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:18,920
restrictions apply to pockets you cannot
for instance

160
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,729
always for an Internet gateway andoras
link you have to send a destination

161
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:29,339
address to the target cause some of
which will be a guy that you have to try

162
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:34,290
being and some backwater town in the USA
where you are located anywhere else in

163
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:38,339
the world with internet connectivity and
the network is going to figure it out

164
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:43,689
and it was going to find a wide path
until it becomes zero and in turn I find

165
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:47,079
a way through to get your message across
that if there is I get within range

166
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:54,388
available and possibly the house heard
he's a cosigner I V within a given time

167
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:57,389
I think it depends on on on the
conflagration

168
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:03,139
maybe sixty men and stuff like that
there are some restrictions the only way

169
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:08,209
to know is to open the college so it's
back to hiking just like with anything

170
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:14,779
else is just checking what you can get
away with services using AP restaurant

171
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:22,829
while their ISP Internet infrastructure
aureus quite big appears those five if

172
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:27,490
you put in your browser now and you
check it you're gonna see Roe packets of

173
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:33,279
the no worries processing and all that
basically lets you able people you can

174
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:38,320
follow people will have our radio and
their coroner willingly chance meeting

175
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,490
where to go with her car and what they
do

176
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:50,890
when they are stopped if they go they
take whatever a bike or until they go

177
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:55,650
hiking and they have a mobile handheld
with if your ass you can see where you

178
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:59,860
can see the speeds you can see the
altitude because your castle things most

179
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:04,840
of these are currently we GPS and the
protocol is very tightly need are very

180
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:11,980
tightly coupled with that position
tracking GPS is freely available so you

181
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:18,230
can do all kinds of stuff i mean you can
if you want to see if they're the

182
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,910
respect in the speed limits

183
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,490
check every every row they've been to
uncorrelated with a speed limits or just

184
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:31,320
check with their houses were or family
or whatever but my point is its

185
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:38,240
thousands of knows the traffic for a
product like this is almost in the range

186
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,309
of a megabit per second and that's if
you consider what the probable actually

187
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:42,860
is

188
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:52,639
that's a pretty high rate let's connect
with Sault reversing their one of the

189
00:18:52,640 --> 00:19:31,160
applet so its use for to see what I
gates are available basically

190
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:41,470
right now so most accessible and I
cannot use my phone right now

191
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:57,040
ok so what you can do is to APRs on fire
and if you google AB IPRs dash I S and

192
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,970
you look for available I gates you're
gonna find a pitch I think it's a POS

193
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,270
chewed on that of something like that
you're gonna see the Apple Ford you need

194
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:11,879
the album you rebirth for a player
you're going to find a space for which

195
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,490
does not just a passcode and if you use
your username to log in and then use a

196
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:19,260
filter coziness specify field during
your connect to the server to only get

197
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:24,640
the package for your interest on you can
get only I guess it's only been knows

198
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,280
our existence ending position reports
and mostly the Pakistan sound by this

199
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,889
because there are only position
reapportion you can see the light still

200
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:40,430
on you too can see where they are
located in one of the things I want to

201
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:47,870
look at this housing office peaceful
Packers this let's say their core

202
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:54,129
parsing function of a PRS see that's a
user-defined a third-party packets

203
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:58,110
they're basically packet impact at the
finish

204
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:03,159
they may be friends is that you certify
lets you do anything you can put

205
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:09,680
whatever you want in the APRs by a third
party is basically the same but he has

206
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:16,240
more restrictions you cannot for
instance put any path you one and you

207
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:24,070
have to have a ballad path inside the
message in the healer and implementation

208
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,710
may have some restrictions on what to do
with that

209
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:32,799
depending on the implementation they
require you to have some conditions map

210
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:39,399
for instance in the past has to contain
a specific a special call signs are no

211
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:45,370
real consensus popular elements of tell
the network needs to route that packet

212
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:52,289
renegades in the case of third-party you
only the only real way to find our

213
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:56,960
history the implementation for review
see them in this case were gonna see

214
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:06,779
that it's fairly permissive so rarely
check if the path is valid if the common

215
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:13,409
sense look ok the co census basically
off an American usually too literal

216
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:21,029
lower 71 number and then the wrestlers
up to six months in with Bosch idle it

217
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:26,960
represents what I was talking about
mobile g1 2319 is usually for mobile so

218
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:34,559
that's pretty much and you can get you
can get away with this i really do it

219
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,350
the problem with this

220
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,379
of these very obvious and we were
looking to other possibility is that the

221
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:47,260
product allows you to do that some
precautions during a test on their

222
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:55,010
pretty much in every post illegal to
transmute obscuring encrypted

223
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:59,620
communications even if you have a ham
radio license you cannot trust me

224
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,479
anything encrypted only one with the
approval h2o is the government

225
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:09,150
so if you do transmit something you have
to make sure that your kesariya publish

226
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:13,360
or not do it all so this will not be
tested on the air

227
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:22,439
the band police I'm police it's
literally most countries they called the

228
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:29,160
colombian police see us it's pretty much
the same just because amateur radio

229
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:37,730
license enough good faith it's the on
its operators are actually enforcing the

230
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:42,450
rules so if they see people misbehaving
it's usually self-contained and the

231
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:47,890
response may even me feel sick I mean
they may go to your house or they may do

232
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:51,910
something to your transmission lines in
my cat your phone on you want and I will

233
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:57,620
ever know they can report to the
authorities if they do without you can

234
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:05,550
get very hefty fine so what can be done
on internet-connected prosecutors and

235
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:12,360
this really I will openly relaying
mostly everything you send them

236
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:21,429
looks somewhat balanced you can you can
use on ridding you can use multiple

237
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:28,290
layers of ruling you can use tourists
and access by rooting out people it's so

238
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:34,250
you can mask the source of your
communications over the Internet until

239
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:39,650
the point where you really frequency and
all things so with this you could be

240
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:45,190
sitting here sent a package of a network
to a specific call center doesn't need

241
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:51,460
to exist and later someone who is maybe
driving or without internet connectivity

242
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:57,410
just in a house or car and they called
whatever anywhere in the world where

243
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,620
there is coverage

244
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:12,939
so think so you could do to you when a
half let's see command-and-control no

245
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,860
war for other things things are ok
leyland internally minutes say you have

246
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:24,080
compromised something and you gonna kiss
away your do you isolate yourself from

247
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:33,970
earlier off of control of those things
if you wanna see communicate with them

248
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:42,980
their work without revealing or using
any pressure systems in possibly being

249
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:48,720
watched channels you could use this
Google you set up your own a get even

250
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,990
with you get your license and you could
be using this for relaying information

251
00:25:53,990 --> 00:26:01,059
very much and if you're my mission can
do with this yugo transmitters turn and

252
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:06,800
then they will hopefully do whatever you
ask them to promise it's not completely

253
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:16,210
out of respect so are you saying hi I am
as I said before in the beginning its

254
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,830
packet I was one character as you're
probably gonna wreck on nicely

255
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:24,850
characters from Max earlier when I see
koalas you gonna see the ashes stuff

256
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:32,678
like that you're gonna see just it's an
ASCII table really is and its previous

257
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:38,429
reminds her that he served some of them
are under the news for instance space

258
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:43,330
where I mean wow this is going to be
used for right now it's not really ask

259
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:49,720
for sale used for anything if you trust
me with this in future it's very easy to

260
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:56,920
eat act just by pressing the healer you
need to do any inspection of what's

261
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,950
actually inside a packet just one
correct their end

262
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:13,080
that's already given out so the third
party on user-defined practice what's

263
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:20,649
interesting about them is that in turn
will really only if not expose you right

264
00:27:20,649 --> 00:27:25,590
away because of its very obvious you can
actually see that the gateways are

265
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:29,629
passing the message is believed you
connect to a PRS of fire and you see the

266
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:36,320
role packets its gonna so packets for
meant so that's already a red flag and

267
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,200
of course people may be walking into
that but what's interesting is the

268
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:47,570
radius half built in modern the conning
APRs and some of these TLC's they don't

269
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:52,700
show you anything so he will not be
immediately obvious to people in Europe

270
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:58,649
be seen it in their radio frequency and
affects people during the radius they

271
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:05,570
may not see this package going on and
that's the scripts and other third-party

272
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:12,799
basically it says will I was talking
about the path and says okay you can put

273
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:22,129
anything so as long as they're repeating
passes sane

274
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,080
so

275
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,100
very simple triple example you say
you're sure to find a third-party

276
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,779
packets if you're not as there are left
bracket in the beginning it's the only

277
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:40,600
common in those packets its green Isle
as a yes

278
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,360
CBC with having you probably don't want
to roll your own crypto you probably

279
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:53,219
want to rely on things so that you don't
let's say make very obvious mistakes but

280
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:59,990
in reality you can get away with using
the stream cipher engine oil complex and

281
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:06,240
it's not a major Packers constant size
sometimes you're going to have to

282
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,799
implement some tricks to to make it more
flexible and just plain simple stupid

283
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,658
stream cipher and nothing else

284
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:37,360
the simple exercise your check here

285
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:46,719
so

286
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:55,169
bypassing the beginning all the way in
the top of my dick that is only used

287
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:58,240
because they're pretty sure he will
decrypt the Packers are you can check

288
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,789
out your actually create something I say
no is an actual sense and you don't want

289
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:07,570
to have anything that can be identified
if you want to have magic powers running

290
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:13,668
for like that but as an exercise in
Seoul call announced it struggled to

291
00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:25,580
implement but in reality it's very easy
to leave her very easy

292
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:31,399
channels normal packets will usually if
you wanna coach analyst you try to find

293
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:37,080
loopholes in the specification things
like conditions them develop

294
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:44,520
implementation screw up like they may
check rock on this and then require a

295
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:50,020
specific field in the form and then it's
to be present but in order for you may

296
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:56,590
be in use something as containing the
fuel then you can use of space in those

297
00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:01,669
fields that happened to be on US-russian
implementation that's one way to go

298
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:07,840
about it its implementation dependent so
you may cause problems you may actually

299
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,740
exposed box in the implementations
things freaking especially because it's

300
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,950
all a string manipulation just like it
was done in the nineties so if you

301
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:37,140
actually going to the code I'm not so
just an example of oil looks like

302
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:49,900
very popular song check out the bugging
but just to get on a the over looks like

303
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:59,640
it's like you're back to nineteen WFTV
format string bugs and straight just

304
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,720
straight up strength copy stack-based
buffer overflows in just in this

305
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,180
function the recent nothing really I
mean there's no pressing both I recall

306
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,720
but it gives you an idea of what's going
on every I mean if he looks like that

307
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:20,670
and it's not like that everyone else
thinks under our back to the techniques

308
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:27,530
there something actually find us an
interesting trick when they finally did

309
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:34,080
I send contains my belief if I recall
correctly was five sequential serious it

310
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:42,100
since one recipient is responsible for
declaring that properly so I haven't

311
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:48,629
investigated us rolling but he might be
possible to use that just like I hope

312
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:52,700
you realize the time is coming mexico's
really interesting work they've done

313
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,470
soon

314
00:32:53,470 --> 00:33:01,720
ever correction is also typical values
for covert channels can inject or

315
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,490
intentional so normal listeners will
basically ignored them but people were

316
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:12,140
on the lookout for those specific
figures will actually the cold weather

317
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:15,539
or something so that's one way to go
about it

318
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:19,940
one important thing is the crash
suspecting listeners and the game with

319
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:27,330
software if you want to look into it so
the pairing comment on newsreels who I

320
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:30,020
was talking about we will see now

321
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:41,809
extent since the upgrade to a four-month
school in Mike E 23 March 15 20 years

322
00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:50,030
old stuff he says it's time at three
data you can send values from an ABC

323
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:56,620
like a voltage stories being read from
some induce role in phase two something

324
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:06,059
and it is usually very basic and arcane
like intercourse in basic comments

325
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:13,560
position that's this will be my key 4-4
but they included between sure her

326
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:19,480
sentence than 12 based on ninety-one
encoded binary day diner

327
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:29,409
so here's their time and extensions is
the Piz identifier for packet type

328
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:37,530
position in the first one is in car
there was based on anyone but you may

329
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:43,359
actually be confused than cutting off
their of the imperious protocol is very

330
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,529
interesting and says that you specify
how you doing calling you to allow you

331
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:53,800
to that other day they are you seeing
lenders and he may look like special

332
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,369
encoding mother actually fixed like you
have to respect our economy will be

333
00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:07,010
completely mistaken that's not be
sleeping on the first the deal under the

334
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:11,430
deal am part of the package it is
basically one included so you get about

335
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:18,589
44 beats usually in in those packets are
you can reuse for whatever you want or

336
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:25,080
you can just use the whole comment
basically one and they will relay this

337
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:40,759
no problem and it will log on the
calling a normal packet

338
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:48,990
so specific israelis really long there's
lots of things I'm sure I've missed

339
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:55,089
plenty of things besides the telemetry
extensions you also have wasted

340
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:59,710
potentially abuse but that's again
implantation depending opposition and be

341
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:05,310
willing meaning that if you're not
sending the coordinates with Billy data

342
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:10,670
like schools 00 gonna start cutting the
precision of the location it's used for

343
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:15,030
privacy because like I said you could
connect to internet watch where people

344
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:21,730
are going so maybe you don't want people
to trust you so persistent Mb with the

345
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:29,020
grades imprecision of the GPS tracking
the position information to let see

346
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:36,670
progressively bigger grits and them up
so if you change the most significant

347
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:41,330
part of the coordinators are so you get
the rain Scharf cerebral several awesome

348
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:46,330
feed you go off its gonna be a couple
hundred dansk on the oculomotor 10

349
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:51,470
kilometers 100 kilometres stuff like
that you coul argues that foreign coin

350
00:36:51,470 --> 00:37:00,129
you're on there if you want to find
loopholes and we stop use that you use

351
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:07,340
3d implementation don't trust the
specification like a textbook that's the

352
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:11,510
developer at the end of the day's the
one who's trying to transform into

353
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:16,030
something functional and his shoe money
he's gonna screw up or he's gonna be

354
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:18,640
lazy and tribal voice on thanks

355
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:26,850
like declining overly complex sequences
or whatever one thing that you do keep

356
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:30,920
in mind for your testing any kind of
covert channels

357
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,099
radio protocols two things one is
direction finding and no one is

358
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:39,829
fingerprinting off your pants Miller
Anna when I get into that bug basically

359
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:46,260
means someone come find when you're
transmitting from they cannot so that's

360
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:54,020
a very precisely figure out what your
maker model of the transmitter is you

361
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:59,710
could tell within a very close range
that you're using these radio to trust

362
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:04,700
me that if you're messing with people on
your chain simulation tools away form

363
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:10,879
the harmonics to cuz everybody there may
have different properties so princess

364
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,040
Chinese radius are very sensitive and
very

365
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:23,410
during their very sensitive meaning that
you can copy signals that are very low

366
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:29,399
and I'll see you merely balls which is
reasonably recent it will offer

367
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,560
something that was like three dollars or
four E

368
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,960
but they're not very selective and their
number is showing us on the output if

369
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,440
you check the spectrum you're gonna see
that there are harmonics off your of

370
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,550
your transmission there's going to be an
upper frequencies are basically your

371
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:55,370
sense signal at NYU and that can be used
to figure out who is who

372
00:38:55,370 --> 00:39:01,750
likelihood of the texan by means of
frequency hopping and this is useless

373
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:06,650
and APRs if your gonna take advantage of
this system if you're rolling your own

374
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:13,920
ski it's not very useful for down
because commercial solutions they can

375
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,260
actually truck frequency hopping in the
range of 2,000 per second so some

376
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:24,630
several tens of thousands of euros
interception solution from a German

377
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:28,970
company harm that I wasn't holding name
because a friend was kind of sharing

378
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:34,939
that with confidence so then asked
basically getting some of the

379
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:42,840
specifications for actual government
used for military use various gives you

380
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:48,900
a sense of reality like you have to get
much more sophisticated to actually

381
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,160
avoid the

382
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:59,700
they look awesome in the tactical and
also easily being tried with that much

383
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:04,450
of a minister rely on chief equipment if
you're going to do anything that you're

384
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:15,790
not supposed to have fun just so what do
I do if it was I mean the guy makes a

385
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:19,620
huge effort on one of the things that he
has the best the moderate or Fri 25

386
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:23,140
available in an open source
implementation it's really good space in

387
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:29,509
our QB acts which is the only pure
review magazine in a ham radio the mall

388
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:35,000
later Friday 25 and it's really good I
mean it can be called packets that all

389
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,280
our other Muslims were basically
struggle with your second spiteful

390
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:47,290
library basically I want to speed when
connecting to the internet to trust your

391
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:53,480
dose available interfaces able won by
Spain until then I have to get that done

392
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:59,690
unfortunately because it was made with
junk parts like some for a young I

393
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:04,720
haven't slept since yesterday and that's
the reason that I cannot make a full

394
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:13,000
team with that the softmod it's based on
their wifi ready to talk about probably

395
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,780
going to be a degree then eventually
completely and not use the basis of from

396
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:26,320
him or later and all he does is just
because their packets from the Apple the

397
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:31,710
basic level of frustration so you can
some of the

398
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:36,650
tricks I implement that you can you pass
through them directly to assist in a POS

399
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:46,580
software so it's transparent and that's
the library using twister for a network

400
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:52,970
inside so there's a lot of in every town
so I can implement the target pharmacy

401
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:58,589
soon may be open source I have still to
clean up code then a bunch of things

402
00:41:58,589 --> 00:42:08,000
with it and i think im over to limit or
really any questions

403
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:17,730
135 partially because they think you
were slowly over time but I think maybe

404
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:23,490
we take questions in the break too so we
don't go around their schedule to watch

405
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:29,629
but thank you very much and it's a whole
can of worms
