1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:15,090
welcome

2
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:21,170
I didn't come up with anything short of
a title match damn about me

3
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:26,650
hi I think I'm a hacker of some kind on
the internet and lately I just found

4
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:35,849
something called the Instagram well I
just find it funny people our share

5
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:48,640
everything in photos an adventure to
type of photos

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:59,230
one day I found someone has posted he's
a driver's license he's just like young

7
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,709
guy very proud of his driver's license
so he took a photograph and put it

8
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:10,070
online on instagram has technical
difficulties finish for drivers license

9
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:18,919
so I clicked on a hashtag and turns out
there's a bunch of hundreds of such

10
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,560
photographs on Instagram of people
taking photos of their near driver's

11
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,369
licenses why should it be a big deal

12
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:39,830
well in Finland there's every person get
code is printed on the driver's license

13
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:47,360
plate number we have six numbers
including the date of birth

14
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:58,329
dash or some other symbol signifying the
century just read at random numbers are

15
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:04,139
not random in the sense that the charity
also encouraged to gender and then there

16
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:11,470
is one check the problem which sharing
his code on line

17
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:17,000
is that in Finland is essentially
identification if you know someone named

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,870
and their idea and there is no reason to
suspect that you are not the person you

19
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:28,050
are the person you can do anything
anything pretty much anything can cancel

20
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:35,780
their subscription or electricity
subscription do kind of nasty stuff on

21
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:46,970
the phone even you could rent an
apartment or someone else and have a

22
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,480
kind of have to pay it

23
00:02:51,480 --> 00:03:00,780
kinds of comments even get credit there
are many companies that are giving these

24
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:16,190
past loans must have only need your name
address and your credit to whatever bank

25
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:23,310
account YouTube them and you could also
get all kinds of other info on the phone

26
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,420
about them

27
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:31,420
confident this can ask when your next
appointment is for anything more

28
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,040
sinister

29
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:56,519
looks like this here on the lower left
corner and also repeated up there and

30
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,109
the way people share of these online I
couldn't actually take a screenshot for

31
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:08,659
well maybe moral or maybe maybe legal
reasons but I kind of made a fake one

32
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:16,789
year I just thought took the specimen
unfortunate into one of those Instagram

33
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:24,590
photos posted online and I think about
it if you don't know all pictures are

34
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:31,929
public so you could touch the ground for
pictures and there are no restrictions

35
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:38,150
as to what they find

36
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:46,640
just this case like in many cases the
person has burned because it's common

37
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:55,280
knowledge that you shouldn't use never
tell your little one look at the

38
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,460
driver's license once more

39
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:06,710
there's a bar code that you can talk
about it hasn't been blurred no one's

40
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:12,599
really interested in our comps just some
random days of the computer or whatever

41
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:25,670
so far as to what it actually contained
in South its current 1939 code and it

42
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:36,510
contains personal I decode and it's very
easy to scan your computer for any of

43
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,210
pictures

44
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:48,169
ok well hurry low resolution is not a
very good program to scan barcodes

45
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:54,780
actually only always counseled many
tests or it's a perfectly aligned to the

46
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:01,280
pixels or picture matrix so that there
is no aliasing

47
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:14,609
and if you take a look at the code 39
code every every letter is like a

48
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:22,660
constant with appear similar in forever
ep there's no checks or anything like

49
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,130
that

50
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:31,520
the code starts and ends

51
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:39,359
it's a simple then you could actually
make a font and it will create a bar

52
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:49,009
code reader correctly so I guess I use
contributor Network I just very sleepy

53
00:06:49,009 --> 00:07:01,449
program OpenCV played around with it
just random screenshot by Marcy hi this

54
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:08,880
is actually raised code 39 and only
culture in nine tries to do a better job

55
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:21,150
than the bar so he ever have and how
would we start reading it now to steric

56
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:33,568
signs which we can actually identify two
black line that's kind of lock on dedust

57
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:45,740
and then scan using something else
something resembling that 0 users we

58
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:56,819
could for example take samples along the
whole of the bar code so we get more

59
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,230
samples per line

60
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:05,520
and we already know how many characters
there are and where the characters

61
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:14,349
exactly are they can always be that
these same place is very easy to read

62
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:19,820
them

63
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:28,920
some cases people have actually taken
time at the bar code do about that

64
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:34,900
here's the bollard barcode it's not a
new problem

65
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:45,430
image processing barcode reconstruction
when they were very low resolution and

66
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:50,569
so almost always the camera software
needed some kind of bar code

67
00:08:50,570 --> 00:09:00,280
registration to track the bar come from
the picture but well I kinda fun dog

68
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:08,939
that's very complicated happy Friday
sector didn't have to take a long time

69
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:19,160
but I didn't like put too much effort
however you can still see very clearly

70
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:32,050
to ask her is there would be the black
lines here

71
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:44,149
and we can also see a white line very
regularly at various distances and

72
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:50,990
business because think of 39 barcodes
numbers are very similar and the white

73
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:57,420
line is always at the same location it
all numbers so this is also one way that

74
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:07,089
we could soon criticized when we have
one we have the borders of the numbers

75
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:15,649
it's not very difficult to test every
possible number very first time some

76
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:23,120
amount and then see which number the
better teacher because people don't

77
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,760
realize often blur isn't randomized it
just the two of us future and it acts

78
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:40,120
very randomly you can and you can repeat
the same blurring

79
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:48,649
what they also number of US appears that
there are people who may know this army

80
00:10:48,649 --> 00:11:00,240
so even

81
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:21,490
even very much article data also show
you could line and then you could even

82
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:27,750
do this in GIMP or Photoshop for
whatever reason lies the barcode 21 pics

83
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:33,760
which effectively leverages its
continued could take it back to the

84
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,689
original size and see what happens

85
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:42,089
you still never corrected version and
then I recited to 160 height and then

86
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:49,779
back to someone started to appear

87
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:59,029
the first story is a bit difficult to
see but I think I can already see with

88
00:11:59,029 --> 00:11:59,730
my own eyes

89
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:11,319
some of the borders of the numbers which
we could exploit for decoding and in

90
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:18,540
some cases people have cover one of the
numbers with a girl even taken time to

91
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:25,349
paint over one of them another lines
from the numbers in the bar code so I

92
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:37,089
also wrote the truth for a script if I
have most of the numbers of anger 2-2

93
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:46,339
possible combinations and then comes up
with one that is valid because

94
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:51,819
terrorists to check checks them which is
a very public powerful tool for the rest

95
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:53,740
of the day

96
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:59,190
thank you
