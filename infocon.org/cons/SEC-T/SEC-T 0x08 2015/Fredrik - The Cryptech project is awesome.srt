1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,619
ok I work as a freelance contractor
based here in stock on one of the

2
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,689
projects I have the good fortune to work
in this cold the cryptic project it's

3
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:27,580
really fun stuff I hope you will find
that amusing as well to start off had to

4
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:34,320
tell you that not all my slides are made
by me I managed to steal some from Randy

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,370
Bush who is heading the engineering
effort of the cryptic project so his

6
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:49,920
legs look like this in my life that this
is a stalker's avatar trust so i think

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,629
im off target that's not because I just
gave you a reason to not trust me

8
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:59,140
because he didn't actually make this
line

9
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:05,540
so I am gonna start with the origins of
the project it's sort of from the idea

10
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:12,930
but it's it's not really an IDS project
but as I understand it ran a slight not

11
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,619
mind that's one of the hardest things
for me when talking is to talk about

12
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,390
someone answers

13
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:27,850
slides or or stuff but the origins of
the projects

14
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:34,830
well that's a lot of people in the death
no idea making lots of the products we

15
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:40,390
use on the internet they have been
making you know plane tix particles

16
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:46,720
forever we all learned that there are
people looking at everything on the

17
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,539
internet so a lot of these people in ATF
were really upset and there was dieter

18
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:59,380
has since taken a stance that they will
they wouldn't need to get pervasive

19
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:06,780
monitoring on the internet what's the
right to do that its crippling stuff

20
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:13,410
so I have decided we need to encrypt
everything but it doesn't really end

21
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,600
there because when you have encrypted
your stuff you have to keep your cryptic

22
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:30,489
a secret and how do you do that you use
hardware security modules these can be

23
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:37,430
very different form factors and price
does smallest ones are probably smart

24
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,560
cards I believe there is something we
could call and ageism inside all of our

25
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:56,740
phones its name I forgot the chip leader
says it

26
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:03,950
so what you do what is something I just
am basically oftentimes it's it's a

27
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:10,899
server so you take something ordinary
and you enhance its protection you for

28
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:21,290
differential hard and it in order to two
attackers away some attackers are very

29
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:30,660
interested in getting into your box the
goals of the project

30
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:37,829
detroit is to produce a reference design
for a major we are not going to

31
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:43,250
manufacture products we really hope that
someone else will find our designs

32
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:48,580
useful thinking you know I can save a
lot of warranty costs here by using

33
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,550
these guys free designs that they put on
the internet for all to read an item

34
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,060
building products for checkin salary
really hope that happens because you

35
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:04,140
know if if no-one manufacturers this
then you would have done it for nothing

36
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,730
so we're trying to do good product

37
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:16,209
supposed to be scalable it's supposed to
be secure composable later in an open

38
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,358
source project that you can I mean most
people don't compile open source

39
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:25,219
projects themselves but at least there's
a possibility if you really want a small

40
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,980
part of an open source project but not
the rest you can just compile it

41
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:35,070
yourself without the rest we want the
same thing here we want it so that they

42
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:43,870
say to them you can actually sort of
built from scratch yourself how to

43
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:51,520
establish trust in me said why don't
people trust which is that you can buy

44
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,870
off the shelf today it's i mean from my
point of view it's because we don't know

45
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:02,820
what they just do we we don't get access
to the insides of managers damages house

46
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,180
or black boxes by the sign and the
manufacturers keep their stuff really

47
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:13,780
close to their heart mind although I'm
the one who I said so

48
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:24,450
we need we think that we can only thing
we can do to establish trust in what we

49
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:31,630
build is to be open as possible in many
different ways I'm going to touch on

50
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:40,889
some of them but these are you sorry we
are trying to do this we will be

51
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:46,740
transparent and everything we do
everything we everything we deliver

52
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,070
everything we publish will be there
either obviously license for code or

53
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,000
Creative Commons license

54
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,300
sometimes I Common Criteria Creative
Commons license for stuff like like this

55
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:10,900
presentation is actually Creative
Commons we actively seek review of what

56
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:19,659
we do if anyone is interested in less
interested please have a look at our

57
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:26,410
staff and tell us where wind damage
wrong or where we can do better with

58
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:32,270
engineering efforts we have made a real
effort to to find people from different

59
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:41,570
parts of the world we have actually seen
the room you want him to stay as you are

60
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,570
James Thomas on his part of the project
are you awake everyone that's not your

61
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,529
consumers on startup

62
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:59,308
you're not listening to people stand on
your team does very long which is like

63
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:05,309
the programming language for FPGAs we
have people in Boston during production

64
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:11,719
and and interfaces one of the first
interfaces we have for this is because

65
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:19,119
that's a standard interface for
accessing smart cards etc so that that

66
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:24,519
sort of instantly makes this for people
you can more or less drop it in it's

67
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:29,259
it's sort of hand waving to say dropping
but you can more or less just dropping

68
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:36,859
this age them where you had some other
is just previously TRNG TRNG is that

69
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:41,549
your random number generator we get
advice on how to build it from from

70
00:07:41,549 --> 00:07:47,628
Germany Russia and the states are going
to be talking quite a bit about two

71
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:48,779
years and she soon

72
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:56,079
hardware design and build a stock that's
actually that's me and really we won our

73
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:02,110
first use cases we're trying to to
deliveries unisex support your complete

74
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:09,619
their efforts I'm the DNS root leading
that effort from you afterward around

75
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:14,260
the bush lives in tokyo also does
engineer coordination

76
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,000
all of these people have actually
provided funding for this project

77
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,180
someone quite substantial funding even
though we're sort of underfunded so if

78
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:30,920
you have deep pockets and like this
stuff can contact with us I don't know

79
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:37,510
what these private donations are there
were no longer be asleep so this is

80
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:45,990
another view of this is what we produced
on one of our first assignment this week

81
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:52,510
came up with this lengthy so just so
that we're all sort of agree on what the

82
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:57,960
major sadness what would you would have
is an application running up here

83
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,650
somewhere on on your server once to do

84
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,680
crypt operations but you know you don't
trust her service to have the keys so

85
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:16,310
you have the server using to access
external hardware there there is to do

86
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:22,839
the crypt of stuff so what what we are a
sort of making the signs for is the

87
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,820
green and blue later that's the hardware
part of it and then we're making open

88
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,560
source for for stuff here at the moment
because I solomon maybe we'll get to

89
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,819
doing open source up here I'm not sure I
mean these are generally existing

90
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,649
applications so I think we will do
mostly in

91
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:57,619
yellow and yellow everyone knows what an
FPGA field-programmable gate array and

92
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:59,350
lots of people think these are cool

93
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,459
unfortunately I can't really talk to you
about them because I don't know very

94
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:12,189
much about them so I will just make a
fool of myself so I wrong sorry I'm

95
00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:17,498
incredibly happy to be ahead of schedule
because things for me when doing

96
00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:22,800
presentations is keeping on time I have
a couple of these slow so you can all

97
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,589
see if I'm on time and we can decide to
yell refiners to skip some point but I

98
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:36,639
said is now I'm actually ahead of time
so this is another one of our design

99
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:43,240
documents documents this is not the sign
itself it's a working document detailing

100
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:49,949
lots and lots of different parts of what
and it's just what our ages and will be

101
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:54,949
we have this feature we have enormous if
you have a real time clock to keep track

102
00:10:54,949 --> 00:11:01,870
of time and have her on and so on and so
on so on on on this would actually be

103
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,410
very fun to talk about some of them I
could talk about something you can talk

104
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,269
about them or some someone how to talk
about a lot of them would be hugely

105
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:14,410
interesting to talk about like the Tampa
side system in itself would be very

106
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,240
interesting

107
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:21,670
but we don't have the time and i cant
talk about stuff that I haven't built so

108
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:29,089
I'm going to talk about this year and
resources over there

109
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:34,839
what I primary contribution to the
project this far has been working with

110
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:40,430
building the true random number
generator or a part of it is now we

111
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:47,229
actually need to talk about what is what
is entropy versus what is random they

112
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:57,339
need to agree on how we will build a
good random number generator around our

113
00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:03,910
number generator can't or I mean this is
this is how you general build them you

114
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:12,740
have entropy sources is like I think a
lot of people see it as the same thing

115
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,889
as as random but that's not that's not
true

116
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:26,279
and trapeze is something unpredictable
but it's not necessarily could think of

117
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:34,059
it in bits and bytes let's say that
entropy is but maybe it's not a bit

118
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:40,579
around her bite maybe it's just one bit
remember by store or maybe it's six hits

119
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:46,248
random provide maybe it's not always the
first six minutes but you know there's

120
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:51,720
sort of you if you make calculations you
realize that it's about six bits provide

121
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:58,029
that is actually run in your answer so
you can't use something that only has

122
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:05,989
six bits carbide in cryptographic
operations you need to do something to

123
00:13:05,989 --> 00:13:11,649
make sure that you have eight bits from
bytes of unpredictable later basis this

124
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:17,230
is how we do it in the critical project
we have a number of entropy providers

125
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:22,949
and resources and entropy providers this
this is module investiga we don't need

126
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:29,049
to dive into deep into this is a part of
it but this is basically have a choice

127
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:30,759
versus over here

128
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:38,980
producing sort of hard too hard to go
wash number of bits provide of coming in

129
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:44,730
here this is the one idea is to have a
national race and resource we have

130
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:50,949
another ring oscillator this this one is
internally in FPGA which is a plus in

131
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:56,819
itself because one other crucial parts
about your random number so that no one

132
00:13:56,819 --> 00:14:02,679
else are supposed to know what they are
so if this is this is the input that

133
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:04,930
will produce random numbers in the AM

134
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:10,709
you have to keep this secret and and
unpredictable you know you can't let

135
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:17,779
other people affect their resources at
least not too much because what you do

136
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:24,600
is you take your you take your answer
resources you start to a mixer in our

137
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:31,790
case the mixer is basically shot five
well so you take you take it says here

138
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:39,029
is like a thousand a 24 bits 1 cave it's
stuff that things are shot well you get

139
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:46,270
five hundred and twelve insults at this
point to really hope that no one can

140
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:50,449
know what they are based on based on
being able to observe them through the

141
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:57,440
sources of error when when they when
they are mixed together sorry if you

142
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,339
cannot serve one answer please worries
over here when it's mixed with a number

143
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:07,450
of other end of resources go through the
mix her we hope that no one will be able

144
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:13,140
to to know what's in there anymore
because the outfit of the mixer that's

145
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:20,459
actually used as this season 44 G a
cryptographically secure pseudo-random

146
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:26,650
number generator which in our case is
currently the church's cipher it's a

147
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:33,839
stream cipher meaning you put 512 bits
in a new country there's an arbitrarily

148
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:41,029
long I mean it's multiple terabytes at
least long ultimate that will be totally

149
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:48,810
unpredictable to anyone who doesn't know
the 512 it's easy

150
00:15:48,810 --> 00:16:01,869
to follow me is there soon clear lots of
people nodding excellent so when the

151
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:08,240
cryptic projects started I already had
this idea that I would be a random

152
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,390
number generator for my restaurant by
how many people have had that idea it's

153
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:19,110
a very common thing I see like 500
raised its a very common thing lots of

154
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:24,660
people biljana random number generators
by myself I did it because you know it

155
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:37,959
seems like fun it's a cool thing to do
and how hard can it be

156
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:43,340
so I had already started looking at what
hobbyists do is build random number

157
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:48,330
generators because that's exactly what I
was at the time I was doing it as a

158
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:56,700
hobby project most people use analyze a
little bit later on I will make an

159
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,140
attempt to explain what that much noise
has a lot of people use that some people

160
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:06,329
use of pump noise there are people you
guys I'm sure there are other variants

161
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:11,319
one that comes to mind is people take
radioactive components from smoke

162
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:16,569
detectors about that next to a CCD and
take it around so he doesn't get light

163
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:21,679
from anywhere else and then you look at
the end of this is their radioactive

164
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:29,940
decay but we had that discussion and
realize that we're not gonna be able to

165
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:36,010
make products that have radioactive
materials in them because you can't you

166
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:46,060
can't hardly get relief from batteries
airplanes inhibit people from you so I I

167
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,860
have done this myself from was almost
about to start building it and then

168
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:54,800
comes to grip the project as we're gonna
be a really good run around the

169
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,290
generator and I'm like I'm gonna learn
from a little knowledgeable people over

170
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,790
here who who was show me how to build a
random number generator and I'm going to

171
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:08,510
do the best friend of evidence I was
really happy about that so i i I told

172
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:14,290
people about this over beers and then
the next day

173
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:22,520
idea that you start inviting you build
it

174
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:35,280
flattered and I'm stuck with billions ok
so then we have started having

175
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,889
discussions in the project on what kind
of a number generator to build and we

176
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:47,310
had some other ideas like you have
around circuit and SRAM circuit to turn

177
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:50,899
it on right stuff to it doesn't really
matter what's right you wrote something

178
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:59,260
then you can you turn it off and almost
immediately you turn it back on that

179
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:03,920
some of the bits will have changed in
memory in hopefully unpredictable way

180
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,010
that's a fun idea of how to build a
random number generator but we got some

181
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:12,760
serious pushback from friends of the
project ideas within its really pursue

182
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,730
that but the good thing with our
designers that you can actually have

183
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:23,450
many sources so maybe we will come back
to building other kinds of sources that

184
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:26,320
you can enable or disable as well as
well

185
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,409
another thing with the area of random
number generators or patents lots of

186
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:36,850
lots of ideas for how to generate random
numbers are patterns

187
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:42,260
a good thing about having lunch choices
that it's a really old idea so we we

188
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:49,520
found at least one pattern 30 covered a
sort of a choice and more

189
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,730
this pattern had already expired so them
we you know we are not giving legal

190
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:59,240
advice here but then we figured that
it's probably okay to do after lunch

191
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:07,510
choice because he writes covered by an
expired so this is electrical schematics

192
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:17,170
for france enjoys some guy on the
internet this is the basic idea is to

193
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:26,580
have a transistor you only connect sort
of half ways so that this is where the

194
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,500
noise will actually be generated from
the amplified over here provide even

195
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:41,110
more scared to get ice it's over here
and I'll comes run unless he's just

196
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:48,219
transistor that has one legged
disconnected is is present in all of

197
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:57,480
them suddenly when when I had come to
the conclusion that ok it's in our

198
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,690
national resource I'm gonna start when
suddenly there was an article about

199
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:08,929
cryptic in German magazine that I forgot
the name of so a bunch of Germans came

200
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:14,120
to the medalists at started contributing
one of them was competitive structure

201
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,979
around and he had already built this he
started out there earlier than me or if

202
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,309
he was you know better and getting
getting going so he had already built

203
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:32,790
announcement resource and he contributed
his his assigned to the project

204
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:37,690
good time so it's very similar to allow
others over here we have this

205
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:46,540
unconnected transistor replication
replication I added this digitizer

206
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,430
circular

207
00:21:49,430 --> 00:22:00,120
here's a kiss from a CAD program here's
a drawing of Benedict sport and here it

208
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:09,479
is in reality is something we thank you
so much for us to build this with only

209
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,050
through a whole components through old
means that their legs of the components

210
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:20,850
go through the circuit board and other
side of their that's that's old school

211
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:29,080
under it's much simpler to do surface
mount technology really made an effort

212
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:35,399
to design his boards such that people
would be able to build it i mean

213
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,770
physically be able to to mount
components etc and also to justice he

214
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:46,050
has lots of tests fans here really good
design for forecasting thank you

215
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:52,740
considering through hole components we
we already knew that we will have a

216
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,180
really top of the line

217
00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:03,380
CPU and we're gonna have an FPGA so the
ship has already sailed on surface mount

218
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:10,590
for us so it was clear that we would we
wouldn't benefit from having through all

219
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:15,270
compliments people won't be able to
solve our our designs at home anyway

220
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:22,160
you're gonna have to order it from from
someone do it professionally so I

221
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:31,000
started out making prototypes for animus
as the first one little experimentation

222
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,990
boards this one looks alright right but
then you add all the wires to connect it

223
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,760
to your and see you

224
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:48,240
pirates on this

225
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:58,230
I had to make a special board 13 I
haven't really basically produced all

226
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,500
the revisions I have her own revolution
to was lost in history it was probably

227
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:12,260
an attempt to really go with a
controversial 3 I'm using at this stage

228
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:29,420
I'm using the MSP 436 nice little
sixteen you step up from I really knows

229
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:35,299
excellent

230
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:44,360
five minutes ahead of schedule what is
average nice

231
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:51,770
I wish someone else could tell you as
far as I runners to restore I mean I

232
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,110
know how to produce it

233
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,570
you take a pee injunction that's another
word for dialed basically

234
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:03,240
dialed wilde's make sure electricity can
only go one way through the day alright

235
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,380
so you you applied voltage from the
other way so the dialog box but I'll

236
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:16,370
make sure is that through increased
until you get to the breakdown voltage

237
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:22,750
children where it will actually start
letting letting electrons flow that the

238
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:30,309
wrong way through their through their
child and as far as I understood it was

239
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:39,750
a banana slices or avalanche breakdown
is that at some point in time the

240
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:45,980
reverse flow of electrons will start
that will be unpredictable

241
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:51,130
there's like one electron jumping over
to the other side that opens

242
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:58,520
tunnel for electrons this is star trek a
bunch of electrons Russia which is now

243
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:07,170
the site and that brings now the judge
as Osama dialog will be able to assist

244
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:15,050
again and close the tangled electrons go
through and and the cycle repeats

245
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:22,860
actually so if we have my schematics
noise generator here we have the wrong

246
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:29,629
choice labor here what if we would if we
look here just to to to see what are my

247
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:38,080
choices you have a hundred million volts
per division division is these squares

248
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:46,080
here so we have like two three four five
hundred million volts peak-to-peak Casey

249
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:54,590
that so this is a snapshot of our
national ice we have i believe i believe

250
00:26:54,590 --> 00:27:01,250
this is this is what I understood it
this is the break them here and then it

251
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:07,300
recovers and you have a breakdown
recovery really recover and so on and

252
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:14,480
you know it's clear on the right answer
pattern here accepted it

253
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:34,320
because you can't you can't read a
sample at easily something something so

254
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:43,418
if we if we had another probe here at
the amplified test point received the

255
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:48,809
blue is still a hundred me loves the
yellow is now one wasn't so easy it's

256
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:51,220
it's it's not only a preview

257
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,669
defying is also invited thing that
that's that's irrelevant for the circuit

258
00:27:55,669 --> 00:28:02,010
and we lose a lot of details when do you
do when you don't have really good

259
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:06,960
circuitry for that but that's not
important because we want to this is

260
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,840
actually what we want we want to see
there we want to grand rounds we can

261
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:18,500
read with a microcontroller

262
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:29,920
so when you want to extract the entropy
what do you do

263
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:39,080
given given the slides have you been
doing this you know it's sort of natural

264
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:45,649
to think that i'm gonna lose ADC analog
to digital converter to just read the

265
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:51,280
level and that's my randomness what what
what I have at a given point in time

266
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:58,290
should be random yeah you could do that
but then you would need to account for

267
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:09,520
lots of changing parameters like
temperature the voltage of your evidence

268
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,940
Moyes will change and that require
voters to achieve their financial reform

269
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:21,220
will also change based on temperature
and even worse i think is a component

270
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:28,660
aging 2011 conference age from these
little transistors age they will start

271
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:36,340
to change required perhaps more voltage
to break down effect are no I haven't

272
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,699
done any idea

273
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,770
tests have them any closer covered board

274
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:55,740
10,000 times so another way to do it is
to base it on time if you think you if

275
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:04,780
you have a clock running really fast
like I mean microcontrollers are 16

276
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:12,300
hours but incredibly low right compared
to today cell phone etc but it's it's

277
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:18,090
actually something happening sixteen
million times for second and first human

278
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:26,280
that's like a very small part of a safe
and that's just a 69 yards in a

279
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:31,090
microcontroller you can you can easily
have a clock running at your place if

280
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:35,439
you speed or the microcontroller Simon
counter have this at least I'm sure

281
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,510
there are those that don't but so you
have sort of like a multi tasking thing

282
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:47,800
that you have to have a talk by one
every clock cycle so what if you would

283
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,399
if you wait for the rising flank

284
00:30:52,400 --> 00:31:02,000
arising flank is is too high so we have
one here we have one bear we have one

285
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,320
there there but if you wait for that and
as soon as you see that

286
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:15,668
you take the counter value but I do that
mess I take the least significant bit of

287
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:20,850
the time and their counter value because
the least significant bit will toggle

288
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:26,570
between one and 0 for every cop rock
cycle so like sixteen million times a

289
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,059
second

290
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:36,509
will toggle so just take that and that
the biggest reason for doing that it's

291
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:43,379
because we believe what we are our
theory about component aging is and also

292
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:48,559
of differences between the individual
components because these transistors are

293
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,059
you know they're not exactly the same so
they're gonna have different characters

294
00:31:52,059 --> 00:32:00,899
so but our belief is that what while
component aging will affect the

295
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:09,219
avalanche breakdown in our transistors
that it won't affect the quality so it

296
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,179
it might affect the frequency but not
the quality so basically the entropy

297
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:20,159
source might get slower and eventually
actually stopped but the quality as long

298
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:27,520
as a producer something the quality will
remain the same

299
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,629
so that's how we do it and then you
can't you can sample using different

300
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:43,240
methods to try station going from from
this amplified signal to a really what

301
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,210
you're sort of getting the process or
you have another signal and you use

302
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:56,900
something called the Schmidt 322 to make
it the digital signal it's like this it

303
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:06,250
has its way of hysteresis so these two
white lines here so the thing is you

304
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:12,650
have a low and high water mark so there
will be here when when when you have

305
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:17,820
this rising flank of the blue color when
the rising fact when the rising factors

306
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:28,850
above the top line kara schmidt reader
will say okay now we have won it was the

307
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:37,699
one not just until here but until you go
below the lower watermark so if if you

308
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:42,220
have if you would only have one X Factor
distinct level where you say you know

309
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:48,520
it's a one if you're above that and it's
a serious blow if you had the input

310
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:54,280
being one is exactly that you would get
an oscillation of your readings although

311
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:58,730
there are no less real change another
Soyuz Ashley three

312
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:04,320
so this is basically what it would look
like this is just for megahertz signal

313
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,090
to to sort of illustrate this sampling
frequency ruler or if you sample for

314
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:15,450
megahertz this is how often you check if
their search engine in the voltage level

315
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:29,210
on your digitizing Patera 25 minutes
let's see I'm one minute and still be so

316
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:43,210
now I had this circuitry record start
extracting data from effect so my my

317
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:49,050
circuit that this time was a bit slow
reproduce like 10 kilobytes per second

318
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:54,230
and if you're going to do the testicle
analysis of running late for you you

319
00:34:54,230 --> 00:35:02,270
actually need so it would actually take
a harder is a popular tool by Harper has

320
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:09,460
this peculiarity that it reads data if
it doesn't have enough data to use for

321
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:13,640
testing will start over from the
beginning so you're looking for patterns

322
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:20,140
in there and then your reusing the work

323
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:27,350
mean it's always gonna find a pattern
because you know so we we used different

324
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:34,940
tools to to check though the quality was
the turn out to be mostly useful Ashley

325
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:41,350
are for this Tweet tests where you don't
have you don't have like 16 gigabytes or

326
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:45,450
they have to give the die hard I don't
remember even maybe it was even more

327
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:51,640
like 40 gigabytes or something to not
have its restart so if if you want if

328
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,259
you want to know if something's wrong
with your circuit without waiting for a

329
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:02,100
couple of weeks to extract number of
gigabytes of data analyzer test that

330
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:10,080
will give you any indication so the
answer to implements a number of tests

331
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:17,779
were run on the outlined in its books
from the sixties the most useful part of

332
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:28,800
it in my mind in my opinion was the high
square test first I have to

333
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,000
make you understand what it is

334
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,650
as a not native English speaker could
introduce a sentence like this I just a

335
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:41,510
test of goodness of fit establishes
whether or not an observed frequency

336
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:53,570
distribution differs from a theoretical
distribution this is the formula

337
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:59,920
I can't read this if my life depended on
it I could but it's not my preferred for

338
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:07,020
medical information because this is this
formula can also be like this with C

339
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:13,280
code

340
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,940
sorry there is no mathematical

341
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:38,540
who prefers this form out four and five
maybe I'll get so I swear you take let's

342
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:44,200
see doing doing that in my head on stage
and other bad idea let's say you have

343
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:54,810
256 bytes of what you want to see are
these bites random 256,000 so if it was

344
00:37:54,810 --> 00:38:03,150
a perfect distribution of these
characters would have $1000 each byte

345
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:10,680
value right so what you will get down is
that's it

346
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:18,830
this becomes too hard to do on stage
anyway you would get the low high scare

347
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:25,500
score if you had the perfect
distribution maybe 701 someone

348
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:34,780
calculator can do that so but when there
are more or less or somebody value than

349
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:41,650
you would have expected then you start
quickly getting a higher score that's

350
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:49,320
the whole point so that's the square
portion of it is to take your take

351
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:57,900
see experts they expect the number on
your check how many were there so

352
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,910
there's a difference between the
expected and how many there were so you

353
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:06,520
increase your total case for a score
where the difference

354
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:13,690
squared so if you have a perfect
distribution you will get the low score

355
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:20,010
if you have strange stuff there are
there are you know hundred more vital

356
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:25,160
you see her or five hundred more
something you would get them incredibly

357
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:32,649
high school or even if all the other
bites values are or so

358
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:41,390
square tests required see that something
was not really working work well with my

359
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:49,650
random number sorry with my aunt
resource so I started feeding trying to

360
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:52,720
figure out what what what can I do to
improve this

361
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,189
what's the what's the real problem but I
figured that I couldn't really see that

362
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:01,529
from just looking at the score because
the case where scores like you know it's

363
00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:06,329
distilled imma take huge amounts of
information and condenses it to to us

364
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:18,450
more value that low or high so I had to
had to look at the information that was

365
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:24,140
eventually becoming the case where score
so I started looking at the time a dozen

366
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:30,140
US you remember right I had this time
are running that I sampled and used only

367
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:30,629
the law

368
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:35,829
least significant bit from what I
figured what if what if I actually get

369
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:46,730
the whole chancellor Alan and plot that
I got this plot but you can see some

370
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:53,420
strange things has a look at the Y axis
is so it's not really important that

371
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,450
what you see down here because it's this
is like

372
00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:09,129
no power six this is a lot so
particularly these two being much higher

373
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:14,839
they're there to counter values that are
massively over represented in in the in

374
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:22,130
the readings of life it's a million
dollars something I don't remember I

375
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:27,950
compare that to what dominated on his
assigned modified it so that I could be

376
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:32,339
a time of values timing belt us from
from his design and he had this

377
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:39,270
distribution it's it's sort of wider
between the steps here because I was

378
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:47,530
using a timer running 269 yards or
whatever he was using NBC loop so in his

379
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:53,300
case this is actually the number of
iterations his code would run through

380
00:41:53,300 --> 00:42:00,550
the loop until it saw the next rising
fact that's why there are gaps but

381
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:14,270
general general but this looks more even
although it's not it's not perfect even

382
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:20,580
more tests making modifications to my
extraction code trying to extracted the

383
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:34,029
answer being in different ways I can't
express it mathematically but it's not

384
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:40,030
good

385
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:48,550
these images are actually from the email
or because you know some people sit in

386
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:53,870
their room and try to make something
perfect veto the world I had no problem

387
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:58,220
with telling the world when I don't do
perfect so I'm of these are from the

388
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:10,700
emails I sent out to the to the whole
project analysts say you know I so

389
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:16,970
finally I had something that looked like
it could possibly generate good

390
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:22,819
randomness because at least it's it's
it's expected slow para which is

391
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:34,570
exponentially decreasing probability of
being later and later that's what we see

392
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:39,200
here are lots of lots of thanks on the
high frequency and then you have an

393
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,890
exponential drop-off number of flanks
being further and further apart that's

394
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:49,700
that's what we're actually looking at
when we see this Lopez

395
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:56,640
ok so now I had a graph that looks good
and my hardware had evolved to this note

396
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,779
that it's actually a rusty pipe which
was my goal from the start

397
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:10,480
this is the same bored but from the
other side so I'm using 15 months i

398
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,630
right thread and other thing that
good-looking girl said it's better

399
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:19,960
looking that slow I was still using tom
also made this fifteen will tradition

400
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:29,060
had to charge pumps cascade and instead
of just 15 months faster but

401
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:37,360
well these poor didn't really produce
graphs either I had lots of lots of

402
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:43,170
experimentation with this amnesty for
you to try and read out these values

403
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:52,530
without introducing the effects in
Dallas because of the technology used to

404
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:56,930
read them

405
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:04,020
so finally I actually gave up on them as
people I think the main problem with it

406
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:09,030
but the thing that that made it
impossible to do something really good

407
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:14,490
with that particular CPU is that it had
it did not have what's called double

408
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:26,848
buffered registers for reading data from
such a time of capture value I would

409
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:32,970
have this circuit that produced new
pricing flanks about one and a half

410
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:40,770
million times a second and so I double
buffered memory when reading these

411
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:48,020
values would mean that the CPU would
place the distinct value in one register

412
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:51,829
and tell me you can read that and it
won't change what are you reading it

413
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:59,349
because if I need to write to the gala
are right it over here where you are but

414
00:45:59,349 --> 00:46:01,869
there must be 430 at least one thing
though

415
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:09,240
2000 series didn't offer that so it did
not have double buffered capture

416
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,859
memories

417
00:46:11,859 --> 00:46:20,058
so however I try to do it there was also
always a risk that the CPU would

418
00:46:20,059 --> 00:46:24,700
actually right stuff to the memory also
where I was reading about the exact time

419
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:33,379
and that would of course introduces bit
errors that couldn't the text or the

420
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:37,970
amnesty for 30 way of doing this is
actually to disable capturing and then

421
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:46,200
you are reading and reenable capturing
but that's just 20 is really slow so I

422
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:57,098
gave up this is based on an ARM CPU MSP
for their system 32 this is so I believe

423
00:46:57,099 --> 00:47:03,259
this is for

424
00:47:03,259 --> 00:47:12,750
I think it's so suddenly suddenly I'm
something in 40 minutes

425
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:22,460
so again and illustration think of all
these these yellow here is a moment in

426
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,900
time where them see you will actually
check if there has been a change from

427
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:37,710
from low to high so now we get a much
better resolution at this and you know

428
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:42,660
I was always thinking to myself that
this this would be incredible because

429
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:48,000
half of the time the lowest significant
bill Britt will be 0 half of the time it

430
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,099
will be one but it in the AM library and
I said that's not the case and I think I

431
00:47:54,099 --> 00:47:57,500
know why but I'm not sure because i dont
have the instruments to measure at that

432
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:07,140
position i i i i suspect that there is
actually in these think on these as the

433
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:14,319
clock cycles of them see you if the
clock cycles were perfectly equal length

434
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:22,130
always my my scheme would work but what
if it's actually not what if every safe

435
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:28,450
32nd clock cycles is actually better
than the other 31

436
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:33,580
have a bias others from the length of
the clock cycles of something happening

437
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:38,660
for a million times as I can

438
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:48,850
so with this new CPU I could actually do
DNA based counter value capturing which

439
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:55,750
worked really well you have a buffer
like one kilobytes buffer you say to the

440
00:48:55,750 --> 00:49:02,800
CPU that whenever you see a rising
flanked on this invitation I wanted to

441
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:09,900
take the time value from this constantly
running primer on the 1st of setting in

442
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:17,870
this automatically move on to the next
offset and so on so what you get this

443
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:24,020
instantly the CPU will fill up a tougher
time adult analysis for you

444
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:31,800
time about use that I couldn't extract
and make other graphic this actually

445
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:41,150
looks really good so good hopes and when
our tradition nine

446
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:48,920
and I did this with reflow soldering so
it's not just us on a penny more use

447
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:55,609
this stencil to to get solder paste it's
it's it's like a group of us are in the

448
00:49:55,609 --> 00:50:01,220
form of a good that you just spoke with
all over this stands in to get based on

449
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:08,618
every little pounds on your board where
you want something and then you will but

450
00:50:08,619 --> 00:50:13,020
the small trees are you you put out
these components like this one these are

451
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,839
LEDs about that

452
00:50:14,839 --> 00:50:21,180
millimeter age so you have a small trees
and you put those alvin and then you get

453
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:26,440
into oven and I had to buy a separate
comment for that it wasn't allowed to

454
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:32,590
use the health of 144 sovereign so

455
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:37,920
so this is this this thing here is that
point five millimeter Peter pitch so

456
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,370
that's actually one millimeter from here
so there are three of these legs premier

457
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:48,600
limit that I like you

458
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,950
time 30 minutes

459
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:57,009
well over time this is bad

460
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:03,320
this is really bad lawyering up we have
this platform called the novena it's a

461
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:08,960
bug wang's open source oppenheimer
laptop he put an FPGA on there so we

462
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:15,080
built one of these entropy sources that
we connected to the marina to use their

463
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,580
PJs on the novena for development

464
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:22,220
really have to hurry up so this is the
only know you have an FPGA good here's

465
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:26,680
one of my boards running on their lives

466
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:34,120
blue lens eight of them we did more
tests are used this simplistic

467
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:45,529
expressions given to extract one bit of
the time I i found out i want I dug

468
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:52,490
deeper in the case and made my own
implementation of analysis program to

469
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:57,029
make this grass where each of these
small red triangle is a case current

470
00:51:57,030 --> 00:52:02,310
value of the last ten million flights
the green is a cute accumulated total

471
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:08,330
case where from from the start of the
fight these lines or if you can't lines

472
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:10,170
this is

473
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:18,810
individual byte values and where they
rank in an index from from 0 to 256 so

474
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:25,509
what's strange here is these how the
black and purple sort of gets up to us

475
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:30,220
our position and then remains at that
position throughout the failed bad stuff

476
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:39,649
here is even more evident have this
black thing here what is it I can't see

477
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:44,130
it is one of these inspect values that
the black one that's definitely not good

478
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:50,300
I mean this is not supposed to be
patterns in randomly so what you need

479
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:57,050
them is widening I mean I i explain this
difference in in them

480
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:02,210
clock cycle length so you have to accept
up to you can't really read they do

481
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:09,240
perfectly so you have to you have to
compensate for that and I am a bit sad

482
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:14,649
about it because in some ways it's
moving details you're you're obscuring

483
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:22,890
their data so what you do what we did
here is actually to take to some things

484
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:31,089
get 152 more samplings export them get
one use for Norman algorithm to remove

485
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:33,180
bias from families

486
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:43,379
and then we get the goods have to give
myself which passes all these tests are

487
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:50,230
going on your end you to recap ok we're
going to do this really fast

488
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:56,280
this is the same pictures before there's
lots of bragging numbers of older I G

489
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:04,550
online testing and stuff I went
backwards done online testing support

490
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:08,250
for adding more energy sources you can
exchange offer twelve if you don't think

491
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:14,369
that there's cool stuff we can generate
about 500 megabytes per second after

492
00:54:14,369 --> 00:54:17,480
fifteen hours I think we're actually
running a bit faster than 50 metres

493
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:24,440
leaders in their PJs so we're only even
faster than that and if someone says you

494
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:30,260
know we want for gigabits per second
instance it more on this course more

495
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:36,859
course and running parallel which is
like the power either so we're testing

496
00:54:36,859 --> 00:54:42,058
this using all the all the tools where
we're actively trying to engage third

497
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:47,170
parties to do testing we are kind of
successful with that

498
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:55,109
project service within a workshop this
summer we actually have the NSX signing

499
00:54:55,109 --> 00:55:04,740
working with our next step is to build
out the board which is this picture

500
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:11,578
again this is stuff we want enough
aboard this is the same thing convert

501
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:17,150
and more to like a schematic components
this is circuits we want different

502
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:22,400
integrated circuits we want them there

503
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:30,960
this is the devil bridge board which
actually has about two thirds of alpha

504
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,500
border and as you can see this is a
photographer to photograph it's not easy

505
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:40,029
Photoshop so I actually have this with
me you can look at it I invite you to

506
00:55:40,029 --> 00:55:46,589
come see me have a look at it this is
our current status we have a big arm the

507
00:55:46,589 --> 00:55:54,569
random number generator master key
memory we have tampered which will light

508
00:55:54,569 --> 00:56:00,650
the master key memory if the panic
button is pressed we're like six

509
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:06,960
engineers in the project that meet
regularly we had this great fight one of

510
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:13,700
our meetings where we we couldn't decide
we couldn't agree on what Stamper cells

511
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:18,379
was to put on the board so the only
thing we could agree on was to have a

512
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:26,000
good press to simulate temperance but
that we have had 18 points here so we're

513
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,130
like setting up to start building tamper
detection circuits based on temperature

514
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:35,819
based on online based on vibrations
etcetera which is what you typically do

515
00:56:35,819 --> 00:56:40,740
to protect your secret kisses ageism

516
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:46,410
this is the back of it this is this is
the FPGA emulation is connected to their

517
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:50,560
PJs on the novena

518
00:56:50,560 --> 00:57:01,650
so who said it's awesome actually
Edwards no not that I don't have the

519
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:06,580
time I would love to try and show you
this but it's on it's on YouTube it was

520
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:12,000
there was a screening of the movie
citizen for i think im not I just this

521
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:23,270
summer so that screening there was a
surprise session where participate in

522
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:27,350
his talking to suddenly just you know
suddenly turns and says oh the cryptic

523
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:34,480
project what you doing is awesome

524
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:46,589
ok

525
00:57:46,589 --> 00:58:16,210
yeah I mean you want to have a lot of
different inputs and one of them will be

526
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:24,410
this anymore not sure I mean we have to
prioritize what we work so I would

527
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:32,680
personally like to play with a couple of
work but had to get maybe I will it's

528
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:38,489
wiser definitely for me to focus on
making this alpha board first so if

529
00:58:38,489 --> 00:58:43,660
there are volunteers just us I'm gonna
guess there's gonna be a couple of

530
00:58:43,660 --> 00:59:00,450
questions

531
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:15,520
costing sorry how long will cost I
haven't really done the math just that

532
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:22,119
the bill of material costs like $200 so
if you pay someone to build it

533
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:39,780
$350,000 I have a question of conscience
your conscience is it to cure your

534
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:55,079
rivals with your your rivals did no good
next one

535
00:59:55,079 --> 01:00:03,700
have tried

536
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:14,549
we tried we have a nationalized Isles
but it seems like manufacturing on those

537
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:22,700
actually drive to get less noise more
noise so the best way to go seems to be

538
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:27,040
cheap off the shelf stand the
transistors they actually have more

539
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:34,849
noise you mentioned something about
reviews like peer reviews of your

540
01:00:34,849 --> 01:00:42,300
designs all parts of the project are
being reviewed by somebody

541
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:52,730
tension we do get some people doing
quite a lot of review on the list I

542
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:57,760
can't really tell if parts are being
looked at or or just you know some parts

543
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:04,170
so any part you want to look at just
please come see us at the tech talk

544
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:06,440
about it

545
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:10,910
communities

546
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:26,710
group is warm and welcoming

547
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:35,210
random number generator be exposed for
just general general system use TRNG

548
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:46,230
probably have a test mode where you can
get directly from them but by this thing

549
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:53,609
for $300 to get to what you can bring
for $10 so instead please build one of

550
01:01:53,609 --> 01:02:00,690
our our our reference designs are
prototypes I've been doing this for

551
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:05,570
those are also deliverables from the
product so I I would rather recommend

552
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:14,799
that you build yourself a wide choice if
you want them to be itself

553
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:24,229
police interview out of it and they used
that further development the random

554
01:02:24,229 --> 01:02:31,569
number generator but eventually you run
out of entropy get as much out of it and

555
01:02:31,569 --> 01:02:36,429
it's it's hard to determine how much
interest there actually is what I have

556
01:02:36,429 --> 01:02:41,609
been doing is applying tests actually
run the number generators meaning I've

557
01:02:41,609 --> 01:02:47,459
been applying tests not tried to test
that something is good run to the

558
01:02:47,459 --> 01:02:52,959
entrepreneurs looking only at
distribution so so if if those tests

559
01:02:52,959 --> 01:02:59,989
that actually wants to see only those
approve or nearly approve of the entropy

560
01:02:59,989 --> 01:03:06,009
then I i consider it probably really
