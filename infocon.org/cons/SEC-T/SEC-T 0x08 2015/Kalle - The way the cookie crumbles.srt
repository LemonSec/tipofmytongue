1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,960
have to switch modes here this talk
actually has a title even though I tried

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,199
to explain it to the organisers few
times but they kept ignoring its so it's

3
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,609
called the surprise stalker stalker
whatever but of course it's about the

4
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:30,990
web because that's what I do and I like
to talk about and it actually has a

5
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,769
title the way the cookie crumbles and
it's about cookies are really starting

6
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:42,610
about first of course the biography and
I don't have a lot of time so I tried to

7
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:49,460
contest this down to a single picture of
my life and I hope you recognize the guy

8
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:55,690
to be president of the united states
soon I really hope he wins awesome guy

9
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:02,559
but that's not what I'm going to talk
about I'm going to talk about another

10
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,170
type of scenario it's a classic scenario
you have a sim serving on the internet

11
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,720
server you have your a smoking hot red
server there that's well full of Chris

12
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:21,530
if you have a laptop that for the sake
of argument going to assume that it's

13
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:27,330
free from our own abilities apart of
course from having a web browser which

14
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,150
can be considered member of course but
we need to protect the somehow so we

15
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,119
have a nice corporate firewall or
authentication mechanisms for whatever

16
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:43,610
just serviced separated but still these
needs to be able to talk to the

17
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:49,649
computers on the Internet as well as the
ones on the awkward ones on the internet

18
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,979
from this guy of course that server and
declined computer is controlled by this

19
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:04,979
guy so now how do we prevent this troll
the internet from affecting this

20
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:11,550
internal server so that you know that
dying down the forest this guy's browser

21
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:19,250
to tax the internal server while
emerging policy here represented by Adam

22
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:26,780
poses the most important principle of
web browsers as this is the one that

23
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:34,000
prevents your great sacrifice them from
accessing your online banking jobs are

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:44,390
important but let's go a bit off topic
rural or at least it will seem so you

25
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:51,809
have some nice internal system are
considered to be just the system

26
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:57,870
actually I have access here of course is
that these applications so we can assume

27
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:05,180
that it's vulnerable to process
crippling or for worse so the strongest

28
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:12,500
do some simple like 123456

29
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:20,370
separately analysts equal interest which
is fine so of course we start by devin

30
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:29,420
is trying to select username from users
may be ok that works we construct some

31
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:34,880
user information you're still what I was
doing that this is an internal and

32
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:44,660
protected application for Messrs crime
and have this database returned from

33
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:52,579
JavaScript as well or some other users
in the database and put them together in

34
00:03:52,580 --> 00:04:04,110
a and then just add some houses tomorrow
as well yeah ok so now we have the user

35
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:09,170
database scrolling by in an interpolated
in the tag of course more details are

36
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:14,119
not really super interesting here it
would be a lot more nice if we could

37
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,340
have a script type of course you can
just get the script but I'm not gonna

38
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:30,500
standing right thats myself rebuilt
that's filled script this actually just

39
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:39,000
create a simple script and it looks like
this is creates an HTML file the request

40
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,860
and then it takes all the date but that
it just extracted from the database and

41
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,960
posters to reserve part of location is
that location for this is the hackers

42
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,200
servers

43
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:59,969
without actually can sit and watch they
use this afternoon that the attacker has

44
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:07,590
no access to the server could still take
this URL that maybe even mix it up a

45
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:12,869
little bit so that it doesn't look as
crazy and then send it to the victim

46
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:19,930
represented by this brother of course
the victim is some object to visit the

47
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:26,930
euro is that in the background is in
some way or the other doctors looking at

48
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,780
his

49
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:37,599
preserver of the victim to the victim
leaves the data even though the same

50
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,870
origin policy as opposed to separate the
servers are things that I can now run

51
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:46,970
the script on their version of
bipartisan resembles a fairly easily

52
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:53,560
made a nice I also really loved the
usual here with a javascript

53
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,210
history of its own I jumping in the
source of the page

54
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:03,500
there but this of course is pretty lame
an obvious the attacker is able to run

55
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,860
scripts on the servers so you can bypass
the same origin policy that's the way

56
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:14,640
things work let's talk about something
slightly more interesting we have

57
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,469
another application and this also serves
suffers from some from some service i'd

58
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:25,960
injection vulnerability in this case
it's not very obvious takes this

59
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,390
parameter value it's some sort of action
and doesn't matter what you put in there

60
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,449
is just something

61
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:47,999
but let's try and put in a sleek
director me be 42 seconds so apparently

62
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:54,319
we have the blinds a connection problem
here which you can exploit by just

63
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,770
measuring the loading time of the
picture and this is interesting because

64
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:22,310
let's take that that your real and dry
and embedded into my friend so so

65
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:29,780
now we have two friends they're fun of
themselves to sleep for trying tho them

66
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:36,130
and we can see that the loading times
are different so now the vulnerable

67
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:42,290
service actually leaked information
through the browser to this frame that's

68
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:48,280
on separate domain though actually
bypasses the same origin policy without

69
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,140
script because you can measure how long
it takes for this page to load though

70
00:07:53,140 --> 00:08:00,950
some friends in these frames will if we
look at the famed that took some longer

71
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:10,099
time to load it actually says if the
magic secret key starts with the letter

72
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:16,550
Z you should sleep on second and that
the other friends as if it starts with

73
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:24,030
an age 40 seconds so I hope to see where
I'm going up apparently we now know from

74
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:31,000
loading these two things that the secret
key starts with the letter from iran

75
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,409
it's fairly simple to build a little
script that systematically goes through

76
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:42,360
this tough bind the connections to
retract one that read the time just like

77
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:52,430
she does for those who don't care to
properly use when you read it yourself

78
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:59,750
and you doin JavaScript so I did thats
this trip to address do this and the

79
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:06,000
last minute values and actually working
fairly good I can

80
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,050
actually managing to expect passwords
from the stable and some extra points if

81
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:18,560
you recognize whether passwords are from
the middle of one of the more than the

82
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,910
last one is actually the Super Admin
password for Facebook to look into any

83
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,469
accounts at one point in time to do
something different accounts it was

84
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,260
pretty awesome does it is also missing
one letter in that because I didn't

85
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,160
brute force for this particular letter
in my ultimate

86
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,170
upside that someone you want to get all
the letters now this is very interesting

87
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,729
from an attractor

88
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:48,030
to do this but right now we're talking
about the prospective with the attacker

89
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:54,360
doesn't actually have access to this
valuable application so what this also

90
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,550
does one this managed to extract some
data from the vulnerable service it also

91
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:08,319
post the state up to third party here so
I have the passwords posted now at this

92
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:15,950
point let's look at how to actually do
this property will you have to go and

93
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:26,960
pick this victim into visiting some
strange page and page extracted a bill

94
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,850
to pay for that as well I

95
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:38,279
that you won't get my son of actors so
looking for the this is the hackers

96
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:56,000
server where he is receiving the date up
the victim this page three

97
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:28,490
well I'm surprised the passwords are
coming in here so the

98
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:39,779
operating system

99
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:54,399
so you can agree now with me that it's
possible to bypass the same origin

100
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,790
policy and have fun and have this server

101
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:06,160
out on the internets leading the
declines browser even though we have

102
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,769
simmered in trying to predict it was
just the basic time

103
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:16,220
so what to do to protect this

104
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:21,259
well first of all as we saw Superman
doesn't care about timing

105
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:27,689
protect you and what we need to do is of
course to introduce some magic box for

106
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:30,629
the sake of argument of course we're
assuming that the guys that built this

107
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:34,399
crazy vulnerable service required for
building such as shit the service so you

108
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,989
know we're watching it so instead would
find to introduce a magic box 22 stop an

109
00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:48,839
increasing attacks against this but
what's supposed to happen in this magic

110
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:49,299
box

111
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:59,610
well first of all let's us to filter out
the actual strings of that off topic so

112
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:04,819
I'm not going to talk about that because
buildings

113
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:13,089
think that this extreme options which
would prevent the vulnerable position

114
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:19,600
from being loaded in the ninth frame or
in a dream at all that doesn't work

115
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:26,929
actually because even if you have that
the service until these pages actually

116
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:37,129
loaded or unloaded events trigger will
still trigger but they still could shift

117
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:43,759
the HTTP referer head there you know the
weather that the server which page that

118
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:48,129
cost the request to be some will surely
do that

119
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:54,499
out this magic attack from a gem of 5
which will prevent any refer others from

120
00:13:54,499 --> 00:14:02,239
being central and then you have nothing
but of course if you shake the referral

121
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,529
had their only if it exists and if it
doesn't exist they just stopped a

122
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:09,480
request that might work

123
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:16,260
and also of course you have different
other crises range features that you use

124
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,389
constant security policy and what have
you

125
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:24,490
this not sure they may work they may not
work depending on what kind of strange

126
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,570
feature you want to use but I mean this
fact that I used to load stuff and my

127
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:35,279
friends I've been replaced by its
XMLHttpRequest sister and they have the

128
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,310
same sort of thing coming months so it's
not as easy to do with actually easier

129
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:51,459
to do it with a request I am posts in
the idea of a global cross-site request

130
00:14:51,459 --> 00:15:02,180
forgery protection for this sort of
thing and what out of the global order

131
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,300
of protection work you out the magic
tokens to the requests

132
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:14,189
there was some together with Curtis and
the server sixth to make sure that these

133
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,470
tokens are correct

134
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:23,130
otherwise the request is rejected
wouldn't want to have this for services

135
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:30,120
start altered they do you know if you
want to change your email address that

136
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,240
problem something that you wouldn't want
to be able to do through client browser

137
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:42,170
if you say that to all your services not
only the ones that are supposed to alter

138
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,889
date on the server that would mean that
the attacker would need access to the

139
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:53,410
application itself to do the action
which is actually a big help as a bonus

140
00:15:53,410 --> 00:16:00,219
having a global cost reduction for all
your else would actually also mitigate

141
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,639
most reflected process proposing tax
which is not because you won't be able

142
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,019
to get the exact year olds that you need
to

143
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:12,249
but of course it will also kill some
features you won't be able to click the

144
00:16:12,249 --> 00:16:17,579
link and then the application anymore
because that will be rejected but it's

145
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:21,540
really easy to enable if you have a
proper Web Application Firewall load

146
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,300
balancer

147
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:31,459
switch so I guess you did that's already
everyone know you forgot to press the

148
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:36,290
magic secured about the Nano you made
some new card sad you always have to

149
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,420
press the magic secured about them to
secure application so what happens when

150
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:49,498
you press the Magic Mountain well look
at mister NetScaler states that's when

151
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:54,079
they see an HTML form through their load
balancer they will have the magic store

152
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,559
in the forum and then when the form is
posted they will check the token to see

153
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:06,520
its ok so this of course means that it
only applies to forum posts that really

154
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:13,629
helped us and of course you could
possibly suspect that there might be

155
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,789
other services in this application that
actually all Thursday down the server

156
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:25,809
without receiving an HTML post you know
breaking par of 72 research and they

157
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:31,510
don't get requests and then of course
you soon as well so you better beef up

158
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:36,950
its well looking at their instruction
page and how to protect against

159
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:46,409
cross-site request forgery of this nice
picture that says these just this option

160
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:52,800
recruit refer out there if it accepts
only if its presence you'll validated

161
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,330
and if you remember what a few minutes
ago it's fairly easy to just disabled

162
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:04,870
request something of richard is just
adding in this simple math so using this

163
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:10,340
option for another if present is
obviously completely useless there is

164
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,850
another option to do always enforce it

165
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:20,689
this is the one that they circle for
some reason so there are other ways of

166
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:25,750
doing this will if you look at what the
FI beloved answer does the insert some

167
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:32,160
javascript into the pages and that if
you have a fight with a look at the

168
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,750
JavaScript because it's really funny of
the solution is really crappy but it's

169
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,780
also really funny really easy to dig up
the state and they do really strange

170
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:45,639
things but it's fairly certain it's
actually something that something to

171
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:51,830
play wrong with but this magic
JavaScript it inserts tokens into your

172
00:18:51,830 --> 00:19:01,179
health you consider to insert and 20 you
ralph is of course may result in your

173
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:08,580
bringing your application completely but
it might also prevent cross-site Request

174
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,040
for directly but looking at the sexual
talk and so that we sometimes have

175
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:18,200
problems with the request what would
stop her from retrieving month from self

176
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:25,390
and then used up her in the cross eyed
requests that is forcing the victim to

177
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:32,010
some could just take us on to create the
form like this some of the victim posted

178
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:41,930
obviously not completely worthless the
tokens are tied to its so the server and

179
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:46,670
then you need to talk to that is somehow
tied to that of course always

180
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:52,080
automatically submitted and originality

181
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,658
the group you can't just because
companies extracted from fans and the

182
00:19:56,659 --> 00:19:58,250
story

183
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:07,169
good I'm still from time so let's look
above us and so is it really that hard

184
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:12,720
to set up your clients let's assume that
we were in a factor and we found the

185
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,929
courage to try and say hey cutie use
this when you when you send requested

186
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:23,200
this crappy broken service and then off
not to tell the victim yet no son this

187
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,049
requests with you and the client's
browser is short and goes to the magical

188
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:35,970
machine the magic machine takes a look
and say what the heck out so the server

189
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:44,730
is this really possible course it is
possible in flown since at least 13

190
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:49,490
years when such a fixation was first
described this information is basically

191
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:56,110
about something onto a victim's browser
and then have the victim authenticate

192
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:04,969
them with it and then you know the value
of the organization so now the tackling

193
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:10,559
the victim are sharing the same session
this is alan simpson that information

194
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:17,000
that I quirks doesn't specifically say
how deceitful so that's what I'm gonna

195
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,950
do this by the way is fairly easy to to
resolve this issue because it's just a

196
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:30,340
matter of victim submitters password

197
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:39,970
but then lets out how we can actually go
about the people's browsers

198
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:48,000
apparently are obviously the server
there could not say that would be sent

199
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:56,940
to another server everything crazy but
of course you consider trip to you that

200
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:04,440
sounded for larger domain so if you have
your own garden variety of the unit and

201
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,110
articles for the entire ordeal the
domain that means it's also getting sent

202
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:17,990
to battle tomorrow of course is for even
more general bombings because that

203
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:22,130
wouldn't also major things really crazy
emina full-year example.com for you

204
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:26,260
that's valid from carid.com bombing the
new resume be flooded with the coaches

205
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:33,760
from everywhere there's also some other
lists or methods for preventing certain

206
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,350
there's a public service list and at
least the number of domains on which you

207
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:46,209
can't put cookies because these domains
sharing sub domains where the users are

208
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:51,690
completely unrelated to each other so if
you have a domain and have some things

209
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:57,179
that different than you should submit
your domain to this list to prevent

210
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:04,890
users from seventy percent each other's
service this is the modern and same way

211
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:13,669
of doing it the old way of doing it this
way that explored us it's still so they

212
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:20,929
take the domain and divided into two and
then they start second stuff down on

213
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:24,940
second down jackets the top-level
Dominus TV

214
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,840
just under yeltsin sort of Christmas
trees especially stuff going on then

215
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,060
they said if this one of these domains
if so well then we do this it's pretty

216
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:38,889
sore Poland and do something different
than if the length of listen through

217
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,980
them

218
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:49,110
expect this to blow up so in adjusting
the actually moved to the public sector

219
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:57,240
to do with like saying that but assuming
that the application of our vulnerable

220
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:03,540
its application is free of crisis
rippling vulnerability and if there was

221
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:08,420
no other Greece available functions that
we used to set cookies were primarily

222
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:14,320
have two different ways of setting up
his victims browsers from the fact of

223
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:23,169
prospective first of all the obvious one
if you want to attack targets we go

224
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:28,060
around and look for other servers on the
same domain will find 11 that's called

225
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:32,520
vulnerable to which contains a
cross-site scripting vulnerability

226
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:39,940
some words mobility but something that
we can use to set them on their entire

227
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:46,170
victims remain in our cookie will get
sent to the server and of course is a

228
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:51,860
sound doesn't work for me because I do
see GDP only so you know scripts can't

229
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:58,459
really thats my cookies and that's of
course good to use as you should know

230
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,620
that the only does not prevent
alteration of it prevents the scripts

231
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:08,820
from reading cookies but you can still
over right and HW with javascript and

232
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:18,330
you will be overwritten with an honours
degree so read only attribute

233
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:23,799
and of course you would think that if
you set the group's on another domain

234
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:27,820
dunn's deal that would be less specific
done the genuine courteous service

235
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:34,080
should be the service reduce the general
and we'll get into that in a little

236
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,000
while

237
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,760
talk to you about option to which is to
intercept the traffic to the victim and

238
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:46,470
that the minds of Americans are
basically someone sits on this open

239
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:54,809
network team tries to intercept the
response from the rewrite its to become

240
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:58,178
a redirect and redirected through the
year

241
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:07,240
vulnerable or the server that I want to
tax over HTTP of course and then when

242
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,360
the browser tries to follow this
redirect in disaster response again and

243
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:21,158
reply with each other that's fairly and
then you would say well sure but I mean

244
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:25,389
of course we used to secure attribute
for the saudis are never simple plain

245
00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:32,990
text and that's of course great but it
will not help this either because if you

246
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:37,669
have a security it will be overwritten
by anon security over a non-story

247
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:43,169
channel and this is something that is
really think about because security

248
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:49,000
situation people think that the Sept the
Sakura tribute to cookie that means that

249
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,389
it is secure and it will only go to grip
the connections and its troops will only

250
00:26:54,389 --> 00:26:59,740
be sent to ruin Creek the connections
but it will still be able to be managed

251
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:03,940
manipulated by the store writing

252
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,440
and of course you could say that Joshua
but no one can manipulate traffic on my

253
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:16,289
network because it's it's secured and
that's good dude your users ever leave

254
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:19,740
your home networks just a Juniper do
they ever go out on an unsecured network

255
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:25,169
may be so that you can like the money
could be here and then when they go back

256
00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:31,350
to work though still have my cookie and
go in there and be vulnerable with that

257
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:38,428
of course you could say that gesture but
they are fairly short lived in this

258
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:41,799
group is so it will be raised by the
time that it just works

259
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:47,220
sure but I mean that we should set the
cookie with an indefinite lifespan that

260
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:52,820
will live for next thousand years and
live on Monday and then we'll at the

261
00:27:52,820 --> 00:28:02,389
same time on the server to keep it from
changing so that's why possible problem

262
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:07,519
apparently can overwrite computer that's
interesting but if we now have multiple

263
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,409
copies for the same name

264
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:11,580
what happens

265
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:19,949
well the browser will some old excuse
that it has a request so long as it

266
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:24,930
matches the domain the path and expiry
time on this of course is to be under

267
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:33,030
security so that means that if the
browser has undertaken in session that's

268
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:37,660
it for this path and then another
session that from other polls done the

269
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:41,680
browser will send both of them and the
browser will not tell the server which

270
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:47,450
is rich and the names so this is what
the service it's the same name different

271
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:53,860
values the normal behavior of servers is
suffused the first one and then you

272
00:28:53,860 --> 00:29:00,500
forget about jerusalem but that means
that order is important so that comes in

273
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,190
first if the one that will be used so if
you want to attack someone and forced

274
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,220
them on murder a horrible Curtis

275
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,800
you better make sure that somehow you're
the one that comes first in the list so

276
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:18,899
how is this done well there's some sort
of order food somewhere i think thats

277
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:23,260
list that cookies are supposed to be
some in a specific order if they have

278
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:27,460
the same name if they have the same name
that should be sorted by how long the

279
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:36,570
process that has been created so with
the same path will be something

280
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:44,340
but there will be something based on
vacation time so that means that if you

281
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:50,199
have some stupid page to tell if someone
from that page it will default to that

282
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,620
spot but if you were on any other things
are you can actually get the more

283
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:00,620
specific path so this is very easy to
rest of wind if you can if you have some

284
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,750
page and then you can set a more
specific goals done the default path so

285
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:12,809
getting your degree first industries
it's fairly easy but it's also fun facts

286
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:18,350
cookie domain is not considered here
when you when you decide the winner

287
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:22,279
that means that even if you have this
super generic domain at the example to

288
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:27,049
come you can still have your trip to be
some before the quickest to respond on

289
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:32,440
like specific server on the specific
path and you're still be some first that

290
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,899
means that this actually works on the
droid I is happy because that means that

291
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:46,090
it's actually quite durable 22 attacks
finds his way but I know I'll just be

292
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,299
happy with you doing still across the
border

293
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:52,710
assuming that we have the possibility of
setting two dozen times they're not even

294
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:56,580
more funny things we could do have you
ever tried an application where you have

295
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,230
one could do that identifies your person
and then another cue that actually

296
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:04,799
identifies your application session of
utah snow protection I can tell you for

297
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:12,789
sure that probably even today if you are
browsing the net today and this is

298
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:19,850
because people like expensive applying
for the sake of families would say its

299
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:23,610
large corporations and banks and stuff
you have an application server and that

300
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:27,860
we should practice session using an
application settings and then you have

301
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:33,178
an authentication server which has its
own authentication and i have a web

302
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:36,230
application firewall relative that might
set their own cookies to prevent you

303
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,340
from photographers for himself

304
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:46,879
so what happens if we mix this up if
we've raised bands would take our

305
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,179
application session cookie

306
00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:58,799
application session and force this to a
client authenticates so that we are at

307
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:04,230
the actual valid session and then the
victim prized or something but you still

308
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:09,309
have hours session cookie that means
that we now even though we have our

309
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:14,730
separate identities we still share the
same session on the application server

310
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:18,080
so interesting

311
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,379
Coast the session if you use that the
store sensitive than the attack would

312
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,990
actually get hold of this data even
though the attackers not identified as

313
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:30,200
the victim was killed when a victim of
implicates you might stores things like

314
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,360
the credit card number in the session
temporarily that means that the attacker

315
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,908
would have access to shop with a
critical something and this is actually

316
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:50,789
true because I've done so is this not
just saying things such information and

317
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:56,100
it sort of is but it's affecting more
like this service session rather than

318
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:01,080
authentication which is what decisions
decisions about originally and also you

319
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,629
know when people buy these very
expensive products to to reform

320
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:08,659
multiplication these sort of thunder
soon that would prevent them from from

321
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:18,270
being vulnerable to third in Europe
vulnerabilities so how does this

322
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:23,270
actually a reason you know make sure
that these different cookies are always

323
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:30,279
tied together have a one-to-one
correspondence if you have it needs to

324
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:37,630
be tied to a specific application
specific value and make sure that if one

325
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:41,639
thing just done just throw them away in
general

326
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:47,988
if you don't do scheduled indication
like bicycle through when they go or no

327
00:33:47,989 --> 00:33:54,749
nvm then tried to tie your application
logic to that implication mechanism

328
00:33:54,749 --> 00:34:03,719
instead because I haven't that separate
the means that you're vulnerable to this

329
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:11,730
type of attacks again so you have a
separate session from your vision that's

330
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:16,079
actually solution and I think that's so
I'm already running out of time
