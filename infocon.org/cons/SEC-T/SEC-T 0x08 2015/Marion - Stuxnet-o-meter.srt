1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,820
thank you for reading The Sing Off word
of other stocks employees but were used

2
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:32,719
Stuxnet as a benchmark for the ordinary
abt it remembers the report sucks it was

3
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:40,840
discovered around 2010 2011 and was back
then the most sophisticated cyber weapon

4
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,930
ever seen since then you might have
noticed that were several reports about

5
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,930
more sophisticated weapons and and the
more most sophisticated weapons and and

6
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:58,480
insanely complex and so on so forth so a
bit but that's still in the hands of the

7
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,828
people are system most dangerous piece
of filter every person I've never never

8
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:08,090
looked into the box of the hold on to
the images that some of the most

9
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,520
physical thing ever seen

10
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:22,170
Janeiro work on mower working for a
California company called so far and

11
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:33,380
their production technologies sort of
her so i think im war we're the good

12
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,640
guys are hunting goes things pretty much
black and white and let me tell you this

13
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,860
is actually a month so the times of
cyberwarfare where the hunters were

14
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,930
after the the bed criminals are pretty
much older brother having a jungle out

15
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,810
there were

16
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,590
people are in the way more horse riding
which number where does it come from

17
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:57,789
who wanted to actually target which
victim what was that other victims

18
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:01,079
machines lists actually victims were
talking about her is that targets or is

19
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:08,310
it just another entity on the internet
anymore he was targeting home and after

20
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,430
all it's not even a child there but it's
wild wild west religion because actually

21
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,760
nowadays the good guys are hunting goes
under the guise of selling stuff to the

22
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:29,690
good guys for hunting goes again she had
other comparable with harvest was

23
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:35,390
interesting there's no have so many
actors being active in our West using

24
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,890
their tools as well cause cyber weapons
and there's little fuss about this other

25
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:48,988
weapons and interesting for me is that
several weapons or not by the

26
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:53,579
sophistication of the moderates half but
Miley who was the actor behind it and

27
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:57,870
was targeted you can't really measure
the complexity of a binary based on the

28
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:03,400
victim was affected by it to do with
this presentation has come up with a

29
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,970
with a measuring skills how to measure
the complexity of mother and by doing so

30
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:17,040
eight different points that I feel as a
reason to make my life harder or other

31
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,540
in hunting after his mother

32
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:30,290
these points as trying to tell you how
to make more whether you might grab some

33
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:36,108
interesting bits of information if
you're showing the complexities kill I

34
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:43,940
picked case studies of different case
studies of motor in the fields of mass

35
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,239
murder as a call the school Melbourne
which doesn't care about which computer

36
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,079
just after banking credentials of the
second category B abt

37
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:01,970
targeted member being slaughtered
commercial goals but knowing which

38
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:08,069
victim has in fact government number
which is not after commercial goals but

39
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:12,290
after political information

40
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:17,659
the case that is the first one I just
heard about susan was probably the most

41
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:24,099
notorious bank interest has been out
since 2007 and the two simple success

42
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:29,430
story of one piece of software really
changed almost two decades and still

43
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:35,210
being very successful next to think it's
doing things from machines and more

44
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,510
importantly supply company

45
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,789
construction work overtime of added
functionality and emerging technologies

46
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:43,969
and other stuff this muslim poorly
because

47
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:49,520
open source back in 2010 someone like
the source code of susan has since then

48
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,669
things went wild so several different
versions of news of you often and Sons

49
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,930
of susan's grandsons of Susan and others

50
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:03,729
headlines news has been around forever
and I'm sorry it hasn't shared lots of

51
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:08,419
money is not the most complex piece of
malware ever seen but it's very

52
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:18,330
successful one which makes it very good
over compared to others liked the sally

53
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:30,080
is more fun factor affecting machine by
placing its malicious payload is

54
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,300
malicious paled into existing binaries
pending its 22 the company have an

55
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:41,320
existing binary my friend of binary the
way to start up the executable the

56
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,270
decorative stuff in the beginning

57
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:49,030
look at the entry point will decrypt the
payload injected into nuclear threat and

58
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:54,729
then start off the original binary will
spread out throughout all of the system

59
00:05:54,729 --> 00:06:00,750
in fact several wineries and make sure
it's always been run on the infected

60
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:06,479
machine was also very hard to remove
from she never saw these appears to be

61
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:13,110
about that so she decided to join but
that does not

62
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:18,340
one command controls over but actually
being controlled by solid infected

63
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,440
machines themselves we have master note
taking over control and slave nodes

64
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,969
being the usual

65
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:29,510
components very resilient

66
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:34,330
which is hard to take them because
they've done to target the control

67
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,520
components which is very hard after all

68
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,900
decentralized also so these are very
invasive as we mentioned it in fact

69
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,380
several weeks ago that was on the
machine and other countries of security

70
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:51,719
software actually order of saudi king
with a driver component of a watchdog

71
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,570
the background and scan for security
products that were installed and try to

72
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:07,520
deactivate them and try to hide her
their operation is more forever first

73
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:14,380
version of study have been detected in
2003 which together makes a lifetime of

74
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:23,330
also over a decade which were over
family itself is very long time

75
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,990
bypass this is one of the apt example
that shows just like ross is approaching

76
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:34,009
these symbols of what causes one of the
most employers have reversed but pasa

77
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:39,449
two-component mower with a plan
component and the sort of like this so

78
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:47,240
you know the Target Corporation we have
cash machines reporting to a central

79
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:54,770
server target is a retail company which
have been infected with the client

80
00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:00,080
component of blackboard scraping the RAM
and just parsing rubbery find

81
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,139
information in the room

82
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:07,110
collect all information together and
really push it to share on central

83
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:13,069
server the server component will collect
all the other than just push it over the

84
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:22,099
network has worked through to russia has
a very simple ways to conserve as much

85
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:26,330
as protocol is creeping around pushing
to the share taking their from the share

86
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:32,870
of pushing out of the network itself was
written by the models look like written

87
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:41,690
by a doctor was written by high school
kids I was a russian teenager post a

88
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,000
surplus of was like a stalemate should
load of money

89
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,470
we have a very simple softer making
money again next

90
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,890
was not successfully been used by the
program called

91
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:07,319
bear bear I think there's are really
russian

92
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,990
targeting ICS systems trying to gather
information about industrial control

93
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:23,550
systems service networks the Windows PC
interface were when those gathered

94
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:36,500
information about this information after
having a lot more component but the

95
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,440
spiciest criven component was the run
during the most public attention because

96
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,880
it was something that Ellis hadn't seen
before and you would imagine house price

97
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,660
rose engineers work on welfare or if you
see something that they haven't seen

98
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:57,770
before the first example of Nations
tomorrow talking about evil bunny bunny

99
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:03,329
is part of the Animal Farm apt

100
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:14,589
by Kaspersky there were other entities
giving it a different name his name but

101
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:24,749
got by the Canadian intelligence service
who operated by the French government so

102
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:36,239
we have reasons to show that money was
incredible but it came with an

103
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:39,350
integrated product just download

104
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:45,009
scripts to script its own car body is
work so far away that the Lua scripts

105
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:51,149
can call back into the sequences that
are compiled binary off a funny and

106
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:59,139
modify its behavior at one time talked
about was director of animal farm or

107
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:06,199
snow globe bar bars in the Spanish
Russian to lock key strokes and steel

108
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:10,040
screenshots emotional running
applications do their homework about

109
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,669
like still virtually everything that's
happening on the machine on its way to

110
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:20,869
implement the implementation of the bar
rising because it was surprisingly

111
00:11:20,869 --> 00:11:30,089
simple for being a lot of course the
physical part of our look surprisingly

112
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:35,350
similar like being chronicled project
how many of you have seen gold project

113
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,059
website

114
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:42,279
grade I don't know how people read the
articles on there but I would be

115
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:46,059
surprised how much of the code being
published in copper to find again Miller

116
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:55,368
was kind of stuff trying to hide its
presence in five goals in the process

117
00:11:55,369 --> 00:12:02,329
and system process including backup
instances in tomorrow welcome instance

118
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:11,098
would do is be on our way to tell them
instant ice house process then take over

119
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:14,229
the execution we have a very stuffy

120
00:12:14,229 --> 00:12:19,709
last piece of nations that number

121
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:25,949
want to talk about was just shocked at
how many people you have heard about

122
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:40,968
Cheshire Cat ok talk about the summer or
in mind for the first time so you

123
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:47,669
haven't heard about this very very
interesting group of our been around for

124
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:59,609
almost ten years since 2002 until 2011
apt is a very long time this is over and

125
00:12:59,609 --> 00:13:03,729
I'll exercise attribute yourself do you
think

126
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:08,009
which nation is behind this kind of
stuff around forever

127
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:14,819
the boundaries are targeting very old
Windows platforms

128
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:16,449
talking about

129
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:25,600
but Morris tries to infect your system
when the 24 and even older Windows 95 98

130
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:33,310
the main targets aftershock of mother
was network monitoring seeing richard is

131
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,380
going in and out of the machine
monitoring a terminal server solutions

132
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:48,420
and information from the infected
machines and the most important thing is

133
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:55,530
the temp files but start with the tilt
and the other for it

134
00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:02,569
about other member of the operator been
agencies which are to the right of the

135
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:11,450
complex II complexity we find them over
because I was fined us as a resolution

136
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:17,870
here i think is charging I came up with
the Stoxx little meter to measure the

137
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:22,620
complexity of a given piece of lumber
and compare it to another piece of more

138
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:30,240
serious for targeting all reports and
all the news the other about the next

139
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:37,690
most nations did our targeting the plant
looks like this

140
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:42,660
we have a lot of complexity done here

141
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:48,100
health and less than stocks of here on
top of the clothing consider the most

142
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:53,690
complex piece of paper boxes are
benchmark and wanna compared to the

143
00:14:53,690 --> 00:15:03,090
ordinary apt to the case but how we do
this how can we came up with eight

144
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,990
points that I find challenging

145
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:13,970
analyzing his lawyer tell you how does
that actually wrong so percent how

146
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:25,270
gets it wrong and how better as it's not
unique as soon as you want to infect

147
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:30,120
more than 35 machines with your mother
you might want to go to the binaries

148
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,860
place in his machines are unique or
different from the ones I'm not kidding

149
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:43,020
we actually Animal Farm set of models
that are in our service parts of butare

150
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,500
building a botanist you might consider
that should because there have been

151
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,670
large

152
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:54,180
you want to infect machines desires of
the game without any in a unionist

153
00:15:54,180 --> 00:16:00,969
without some of the Feingold can without
any image including but not with the

154
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:05,340
same binary how long does it take for
the company's actually pick up the

155
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:10,620
binary let me tell you I worked in the
insurance company takes them from two

156
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,920
hours to two days

157
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,110
signatures for a new winery let's say
fifty thousand of the machines and with

158
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,259
one thing signature find these machines

159
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:29,919
want to be represented by the other
backers are a pattern that can be

160
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:34,879
managed by and versatile is also looking
to a very simple

161
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:40,799
BIOS is using comparative thinks just
the tip of the things you can do some

162
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:47,459
hundreds of different BIOS from one and
the same copies of the pieces that give

163
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:54,029
me a hard time our API a resolution to
API is causing by are usually tell you

164
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:57,839
what the binaries about it doesn't
bother you want to hide them something

165
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,079
with strings you don't show any critics
strings binaries and there are certainly

166
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:08,789
thought to actually hold these are
interesting in the case is the usual

167
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:15,279
sort of asked Asian and South modifying
code does have a closer look at how very

168
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,880
easy way to highlight a few calls are
some time was this really very easy to

169
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,949
implement already gives the travel to
reverse engineer because they're using a

170
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:30,620
temp table is an indirect cause within
the binary which don't show the actually

171
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:39,779
be a name so at least as well as the
jump before there's a lot of other

172
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:44,840
missiles to make this harder than just
you know you have to hide

173
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,699
API calls with the strength of critics
strings and shown here is a very simple

174
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,990
to hide your strength from the binary
and also

175
00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:00,630
for the memory of longtime strength of
character to character at runtime you

176
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:05,340
can hide them from themselves from
security solutions which can build

177
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:13,169
affection these concerns a lot more
complex methods to heartstrings of

178
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:19,720
frustration for many dedicated christian
beadles which will get a string right

179
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:29,230
ones near the office kid again to hide
it from other memory or results to

180
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:38,780
strengthen however get this straight
seasons actually the only mothers are

181
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:45,270
found huge managed to obfuscate the
payload America you should keep in mind

182
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,990
that usually Morris built-in in layers
usually you have your payload which is

183
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,530
wrapped in a Parker was wrapped in a
production here unless you make your way

184
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,928
through the Packer you make your way for
the protection there with the payload

185
00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:05,200
realized I don't think there is a clear
payload so as long as you're on the cold

186
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:14,630
you can just read actually 6 KO's really
cause you're perfectly fine so this is

187
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,929
not this is not rocket science office
killing called this is actually pretty

188
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:22,690
simple but most mower doesn't get to the
stage for the payloads itself is

189
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,620
obviously that

190
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:33,659
kind of application others are very
simple example I picked her up we have

191
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:41,750
this instruction which when debugging
for the piece of code changes its layout

192
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:48,180
looks like this turns into an increment
instruction the following review helpful

193
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:58,480
obstruction of here on shelf has six
fights so many December will give the

194
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,000
jump instruction 6 bytes of length is
that the job description

195
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,690
chance that the fifth 265 in his own
section to section this is the address

196
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,140
of destruction self exam here plus fight
so

197
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:19,010
chance here and as it does so creates a
new construction right there just turned

198
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:24,410
into our income and as lovers have
example of self modifying code were from

199
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:28,100
you know December and the world will get
this right because they just cant answer

200
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:34,070
not built to disassemble instructions in
itself

201
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:42,950
these kind of bets in your binary code
you can merge to office case which was

202
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:49,700
just awful skidded in my very hard to
analyze 130 Morris got the first rate

203
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:54,320
this well was it is a polymorphic
richter every time the defects in your

204
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,470
file charges to modify its own culture
look different

205
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:03,990
very infected infected piece of
executable has a different version of

206
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:09,250
the in there and I think it also you can
find out because for the company's

207
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,850
caught up with options for somebody just
happened that's always ago as crews

208
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:16,659
researcher was very excited about
finding her

209
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:25,290
solely through active in the DPRK of the
guy was more surprised you still think

210
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:36,450
so each other or actually north Korea
has public appearance by there is room

211
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:43,390
for other chances are when you were in
fact that the machinery machine is the

212
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:48,350
infections gonna be discovered
eventually there's always the smart user

213
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:53,320
so she's in fact the longer she doesn't
like the chances are that your

214
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,810
boundaries are going to be like that

215
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:01,399
college based options security companies
either tried to find evidence

216
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:07,040
which are like pieces of defining the
boundaries or they cut my hours before

217
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:12,129
her she's so once one of your BIOS is
known to be detected forever and

218
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:18,260
everywhere so you might want to have
updated every once in a while

219
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:26,590
irregular intervals and you want to
reroute traffic that's 216 fetch the

220
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:36,209
area from Russia and South East Asia but
from a local proxy very good again as

221
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:42,880
soon as you can see the updates traces
officers infection who watched Love

222
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,700
Machine vs would be updating its final
season as homogeneous copley within the

223
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:54,110
distance of a few days and this
effectively evading flash-based

224
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:59,679
deductions are engine

225
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:06,050
when you read the piece of motor usually
have a binary but artifacts in the

226
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,810
machine that you need for persistence
that is restoring the need for

227
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:14,190
communication so here's a list of
proposed for defects you might want to

228
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:25,080
be repetitive we track actors mostly
there have to reuse their remote service

229
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,320
so email services the link from his
mother to the actual active behind and

230
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:36,980
to the actual network that is important
but also filings dropped onto the sample

231
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:45,230
the tiller temples but keep popping up
being user names are registered to

232
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:48,490
legitimate seconds

233
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:56,010
changed over time to leave a positive
cases on my favorite reporter for

234
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:03,090
defects was was this one was like not
not a final dropping this message

235
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:06,770
embedded in my memory as was the bar

236
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:15,030
the first time this type of message
popped up in several different families

237
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:31,149
and our apt group of animal farm so this
is an error message stuff think whoever

238
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:38,400
told through several different buy these
securities in our seniors first thing I

239
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,640
did was create a signature for like this
beautiful type on the street level find

240
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:50,800
all the batteries contain the same piece
of code number 6-2 they're not sensitive

241
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:57,050
to their environment especially if you
want to right around that your

242
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:01,389
mother-in-law was supposed to run the
thermal grease Martin Luth to not run

243
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:06,320
any other machines such as sin taxes are
Emily there's this is very simple

244
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,790
techniques and boxes is extremely simple
detecting virtual machines is simple as

245
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:17,670
well and doable and detecting Ellis
machines as well

246
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:25,180
boxes can be detected by 3% books
because of a loss of behavior of the

247
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:29,420
machine itself of the user data that
should be on the machine original sin

248
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:36,220
taxes never their interaction with the
machine of this tells you that you're

249
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,540
running it is

250
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:46,360
boxes being used by human but more
importantly especially if you're right

251
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,199
part of the lower the target's you're
after

252
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,440
usually home watching us you know you
want to target the specific entities

253
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,660
with the company for example the company
uses specific software used one specific

254
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:06,430
security products they have specific
network settings you find the right

255
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:13,740
moment the kids try and make it
impossible to ever LA's these pieces of

256
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:22,780
my principle which I found smilar only
starting to use this but actually

257
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:30,710
inspecting 16th 17th and 18th of this is
a very simple very effective means of

258
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:36,460
two hundred and boxes and housing it so
she plans to target specific company you

259
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:42,880
can such a simple method were just check
for the teacher mother just execute in

260
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,210
the time frame where you expect your
instructions have been sent another

261
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:54,890
meeting after its not controlled is able
to actually follow this logic and I

262
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,650
promise you

263
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:10,430
which this is kind of things he was just
our cat and weighs just sheen's a

264
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:15,100
beautiful match for this was just a
couple still because it's run as show

265
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,409
extension as I can have a means for this
assistance with a Cheshire cat was

266
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:27,570
loaded with an icon for specific file
type of temples and only run there in

267
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:33,510
the context of the program manager the
program manager is the windows show the

268
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:38,230
predecessor of explorers and explorer
and when the show them the Explorer

269
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:42,250
program was introduced before that
sometime around when those three points

270
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:52,659
11 and if not detect this and it
wouldn't executed on the system

271
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:59,289
on the lookout for security tools for
execution so even a drum time when is

272
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:03,379
already infected or the running it was
still have really contracts if there was

273
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:08,580
not referring if there was any other two
running behind her execution detect them

274
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,799
over if detective security products
which does not show specific part of

275
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,119
functionality we would not stop running
but it was also not show it was actually

276
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,149
supposed to do

277
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:25,449
versions of the product

278
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:31,919
think about it yet occurs gathering
security settings from Kaspersky

279
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,159
products which means the new before the
referendum over that target of Kaspersky

280
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:42,440
products installed at a call for a very
often find checks for any other security

281
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:49,420
product so far as we know what kind of
systems they were dealing with

282
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:57,320
Mr Cameron 5 singer persistence which
two things create a registry key for

283
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:02,790
being loaded adult start or through the
service which effectively is another

284
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:09,560
registry key which looks similar to the
two mrs. Lucy or over again and I've

285
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:15,710
never seen actually coming with more
than two different positions me that's

286
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:21,050
what your membership eros want to be
persistent memberships the system very

287
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,970
fucked hard to do this if you look at
selling

288
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:29,480
affecting several different executor
wasn't worth all this trouble system

289
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:40,040
even better would be to keep up with all
possible that there are and combine them

290
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:48,139
to not depend on one single person but
that's a roll back of my thoughts

291
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:54,830
sure the kids running on the system is
responsible for this was back up another

292
00:29:54,830 --> 00:30:01,790
point of self over which would create a
watchdog which would watch the infection

293
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:09,070
with infection too damaged in fact the
machine will go on and inject a credit

294
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:16,270
check code into which did nothing else
watching the inspection work the

295
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:21,770
following recent backup within the
kiddos running through your texts at the

296
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:26,960
same time it was dropped and cracked
version of itself on the disc and could

297
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,980
imagine what stocks would run the
context of nothing else than watching

298
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,430
this coupled with the musical still up

299
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:40,160
if the music's was gone which means that
infection of the curve was removed the

300
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:49,040
threat rather go on this decrepit Andrea
infected machine infection was up again

301
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:56,100
this is a very simple very simple method
to assure the infection is not removed

302
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:04,639
any security number six thinking in
layers before usually when I try to

303
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:10,030
always be slower I have the protection
for their have the impression that the

304
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:13,889
Packer McMurray through another payloads
delegate the payload does this is

305
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:20,710
something that I can always doesn't work
tomorrow and usually this is very clear

306
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:29,830
x86 this is because most others are not
experience riding mower but they're

307
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:34,270
expensive writing software then use
third-party software to encrypt the

308
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:39,210
railroad and to protect the mother was
not what he should do the simple middle

309
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:46,310
/ right here on the actual office
caterpillar triggers there's another

310
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:51,770
problem if you use a third-party
contractor likely being detected friend

311
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:59,370
of our software just for using drugs can
identify Capello's so you have a binary

312
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:03,629
and you kept it with a customer service
which create 10,000 copies of your

313
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:09,440
similar with doctor as soon as I
restarted the people the memory still

314
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,169
looks the same like a binary as
accusatory is able to

315
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:24,049
detect them or their problem so I'm
staying consistent evasion is the key to

316
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:33,950
success would be fully undetectable
after I spent a lot of time on as well

317
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:40,239
as a contractor go on and give the User
Options to like just check boxes of anti

318
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:51,009
tricks that runs in the binary and rub
the binary in Visual Basic Editor is a

319
00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:58,340
basic visual basic supports pic code
which is it's a disease is a pain in

320
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,279
years

321
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:06,899
peak of america's decision of botnets
before it came out its my code which is

322
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:13,149
interpreted by the Visual Basic virtual
machine will be interpreted by the

323
00:33:13,149 --> 00:33:17,199
vision machine and their visit to see
the bike old which you can tell lies

324
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:23,970
because there's a documentation for it
doesn't accommodations for pickup

325
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:30,609
however the script her kids these days
because primaries but other than that

326
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:32,559
it's a transit scripter

327
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:37,470
execute our stuff afterwards for the
does is it creates

328
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:43,520
new process or Chris remote threat to
run for this point in time when the

329
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,418
process is clear that you can be sure of
the payload is actually the group that

330
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:51,500
there's always the case descriptons work
this week so she can manage to get

331
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:56,520
executions of the points by process
instrumentation you can just go there

332
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:02,929
and pick up a child from me at that
point I'm when it's gonna be 13 simple

333
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:07,270
to pass by

334
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:13,580
because I told you confiscation is very
difficult to analyze it is cold for

335
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:17,389
static analysis is closed impossible
because you have to go once and

336
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:21,359
disassembled the code yourself is your
disassembles feeling you have to go

337
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,350
through the code which instruction is
actually real and which instruction

338
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:32,330
this is under control during application
how's your strength at the time code to

339
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:37,120
the winery is nothing worse than having
a five-match series four point nine

340
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:43,449
megabytes are just look like for doctor
but actually doing nothing effective in

341
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:48,460
the boundaries of event to trigger
division of Univision later you don't

342
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:55,560
have a particular version of throughout
your primary abusing structures there or

343
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:05,799
either like object-oriented code is
difficult to analyze a lot of structures

344
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,960
to binary that you have to go through to
actually find the productive code inside

345
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:19,780
the binary and this is another packed
with this is like the C++ and implement

346
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:29,440
inheritance of dependencies of your
classes then you automatically create

347
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,920
lot of cult of structure called the
binary but the reverse engineer has to

348
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,420
make its way through

349
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:48,530
write again very very strange Cheshire
Cat Cat again

350
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:55,220
constantly monitors for security
products doesn't have a layer which but

351
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,549
it has the basic functionality built in

352
00:35:59,549 --> 00:36:08,589
built into the payload it will have nine
different soon cease contact but in

353
00:36:08,589 --> 00:36:13,339
large doses of times they would be like
this time between contact the census of

354
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:19,930
its cause no noise on the perimeter of
the network the internet settings of the

355
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:27,160
machine and all about these and other
settings to not only while contacting

356
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:34,058
its didn't support the options that are
collections you still have the dial-up

357
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:41,900
connection you're going to see very well
considerate and all layers of operation

358
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:49,500
how to be evasive least common in

359
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:57,750
beauties communication to the interval
be done in this approach process so such

360
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:02,430
a cut would start an invisible instance
after default browser and inject its

361
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:07,759
since the communication come into this
browser instance to have the web browser

362
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:18,590
talk to a remote and I'll catch any
attention of security number

363
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:25,930
we're almost there monolithic design
build a stand-alone binary to infect the

364
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:34,680
system should should have its framework
911 call jobs but have different viruses

365
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:43,129
different components different plugins
do the dedicated work this hard easier

366
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:48,490
to our place it piece by piece and it's
more flexible and more evasive to have

367
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:55,560
different components invading the
computer to a certain extent in invasion

368
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,820
chance because there are several
different instances of itself the system

369
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:05,110
and has multiple instances of itself
running almost all the time which

370
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:09,590
communicate with each other and as much
older versions have a driver component

371
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:15,290
which would do the protection of the
watchdog functionality of the mower

372
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:23,710
fostering development seen as soon as
his ass people after missing off Samoa

373
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:32,830
which is going to go up their own
protection for example for this new pink

374
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:45,490
is gonna come with with the bar and
their functioning Trojans with a

375
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,850
framework component which was already
first they were being installed to

376
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:55,470
target systems and then decide which
plugin which plugin for the next you can

377
00:38:55,470 --> 00:39:03,509
see the very sophisticated plug-in
installation just pluck new

378
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,980
functionality into

379
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:09,210
framework installed the system didn't
didn't actually get the Droid with them

380
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:16,120
with a string of the station however you
can see there's a lot of equities and

381
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:21,060
Muslim nation state power which doesn't
come as stand-alone binary but as a

382
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,830
platform and then just choosing picking
the functionality that the puck from

383
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,500
once to add

384
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:37,980
fears over that's more than all but does
the same things over the region

385
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,390
companies have become smarter overtime
and have been trying to detect these

386
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:47,920
things things are happening over and the
region so dealing with stupid skinny

387
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:54,770
engines and twenty years ago actually
have smart security to build smart

388
00:39:54,770 --> 00:40:01,630
security presence not only in the cold
but also behavior and it just does the

389
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:05,950
same things over and over again at some
point even if we're gonna have a

390
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:11,689
presence detect the behavior that's
repetitive behavior so this way we can

391
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:16,990
decide which is moving announce fears
are known as few as remembered a run

392
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:24,979
something advanced biofuels and moved to
tears

393
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:30,080
execution at a like Words With Music
speakers virtual machine execution use

394
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,750
of pain from the reverse engineer
because you have to go through the

395
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:38,870
vision machine actually find out what
Europe so the codes is trying to do you

396
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:45,150
have to manually allies washing machine
code and put the pieces together that

397
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:54,420
should be doing based on both coasts
from from where E is still a flirt

398
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,109
region engineers are you won't find many
analysts

399
00:40:58,109 --> 00:41:03,078
security solutions which are able to
analyze the spindle kids running kernel

400
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:10,319
even if the colon chrome is not that
smart as you will see looking for some

401
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:17,380
things running kernel are but the safer
side than the usual and book isn't and

402
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,809
never dare to actually touch biased
because I don't know any security

403
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:25,789
company nowadays which can actually
watch our biases secure any other

404
00:41:25,789 --> 00:41:35,730
component then was running on your on
your hydration something that was smart

405
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:44,740
but that's a particular office PC
Rebecca under try to fire on industrial

406
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:49,578
control systems were basically built as
cervical and architecture so you have

407
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:55,140
your clients which are you human machine
interface will talk to an OPC server so

408
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:01,190
the the basic Windows application
windows Server PC server which would

409
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:08,260
translate the input Fri July two actual
system now I have no idea of industrial

410
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:12,869
systems and tell you straight up an idea
of ICs are good and when those reasons

411
00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:18,760
she found out when going through heroics
is that her PC thing is still only

412
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,700
Windows API so you're able to read the
documentation when you will have no

413
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,368
trouble at all

414
00:42:24,369 --> 00:42:29,700
analyzing have expanded its component
what is ICS coupon did though was caused

415
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:35,520
a lot of media attention of people cause
havoc slick very sophisticated I think

416
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,869
it's not because you just went through
their Android API calls and

417
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:55,240
another engine of my mother was measured
before but he would come with a lower

418
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:01,689
interpreter which would parse and
execute Lua scripts which is installed

419
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:07,039
on the system and download the scripts
which told what to do the following

420
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:13,900
where you have scripts that are being
done all the money plain text format

421
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:20,339
usually embedded into HTML so any
security solution will just see website

422
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:26,308
being down those from and not an actual
buying these were being put into the

423
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:31,609
likud threats which would then the
scripts to the lower engine engine with

424
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:39,480
interpret the scripts scripts invoke
functionality that was embedded in the

425
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,029
loo and present the scripts with
corruption do was injected behavior into

426
00:43:44,029 --> 00:43:52,079
the into the body under this regime
change my behavior agenda but just going

427
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:58,289
back into the study compiled code after
interpreter just picking whichever

428
00:43:58,289 --> 00:44:03,710
function they wanted to have this way
but he could be doing is owned by the

429
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:06,210
changes flavor

430
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:12,250
at runtime free stuff free because
scripts are in this case it would not

431
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:20,380
catch a lot of attention right this
weather makes people making that

432
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:31,180
shouldn't be so let's reconsider points
if you want to write good number of your

433
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:35,960
brain areas are you want to see that you
don't have several machines in fact that

434
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:42,300
he's pushing out of your building but
that's hard to live your regular updates

435
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:48,510
that you update your brain research and
conservation but nothing like once an

436
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:54,359
hour or once a day but maybe once a
month or maybe not a specific time

437
00:44:54,359 --> 00:45:02,650
frames at all engines don't believe the
facts don't want to fall same name all

438
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:07,109
over again for signals be detected by
security solutions you want to be

439
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:11,299
sensitive to the environment around you
might want to think before you write who

440
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:23,330
is actually the target we want to 221 in
fact i just want to see how you can

441
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:24,049
prevent

442
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:29,570
resistance to consider democracies and
machine even if security software

443
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:37,750
inspector by area or the persistence you
might want to see

444
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:44,220
onto the machine vision and ideas of
what makes my life harder

445
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:51,598
and another thing about from
architecture lot of 13 but the set of

446
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,859
images by which helped each other out
and all secure about their positions on

447
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:59,450
the machine and you might want to touch
on those fears because this is what we

448
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:06,529
saw the reverse engineer the most
obvious together let's see the hairs are

449
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:12,270
putting this again the 700 families you
see a lot of the the Chancellor is

450
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:20,770
really empty the blue squares indicate
that was performing these such as the

451
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:26,580
music and you can see that for example
like the story and didn't have anything

452
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:38,299
physical have a target that had some
interesting bits but and are highly

453
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:43,890
priced French Spanish mother wasn't that
the physical either leading the pack are

454
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:52,569
evil bunny showed her how to put up the
most too and I wasn't redirection

455
00:46:52,570 --> 00:47:02,020
interesting though the side just told
the empty

456
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:08,330
amount of 56 million for the course you
don't have to be the most sophisticated

457
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:18,350
the most successful closing of us get
back to stocks and whether they're put

458
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:29,759
all of the presented my families and
give them writing is absolutely faces

459
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:36,770
complexity than we have susan have a bar
which are somewhat interesting and we

460
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:40,980
have said so it's been a really good
person or from my point of view the most

461
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:51,810
sophisticated 10 bunny and write the
stock centimeter I hope you get

462
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:57,460
information about how to how to make
your mobile better future and give me a

463
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:04,820
hard time in Dallas actually I
appreciate complex more actually is more

464
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:12,100
fun which complex thing so I thank you
for your attention if any questions I

465
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,910
think there's time left

466
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:23,250
let me sorry we have microphones walk
around

467
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:28,030
so the amide my first true my first
reaction is a person that I don't know

468
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:37,010
that this is more like to thank you for
the cookbook you shouldn't do this you

469
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:41,110
shouldn't do that you actually want
people to make their you want your job

470
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:47,840
to be more challenging yet this is my
secret desire to have over as you get a

471
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:56,240
noise they are gone I could you fix this
before I have to sit here with a

472
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:05,709
personal contact to actually playing

473
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:10,260
so yeah because that's the select the
second part of his life was there

474
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:13,630
something that should have been on here
that you you still used to detect things

475
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:16,619
that you didn't want to tell us because
you don't have something about pocket

476
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:26,119
rocket sure a lot of stuff to talk about
but there was one there was one column

477
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:39,000
that no now we're all implemented number
three was completely

478
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:55,630
reported adverse effect on stocks that
did that thing as well like everyone has

479
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:58,990
to leave some artifacts and system
specially for persistence you can't have

480
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:07,660
assistance with other she leaving
something on the disc to some degree but

481
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:11,890
maybe it's possible to expand this by
having you know they did it to this

482
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:20,400
degree yeah I mean that's not a
scientific approach scientific paper

483
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:25,800
there's a lot more points than he's 80
to give me a hard time that there's more

484
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:30,770
to the complexity of his more than than
usual here just about the approach of

485
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:38,410
how do you can evaluate binary not as
sophisticated as the next big blog post

486
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:43,520
on the most complex forever

487
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,200
is adding there's probably a lot of
people that would like to maybe help out

488
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:53,529
with this makes this even more useful is
a really nice start I'm sure there are

489
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:57,260
people who maybe you can make this into
an open source project or something our

490
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:06,750
project idea of making a little stunned
that over not sure if you would like to

491
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:13,650
learn how to build better Miller now
there were questions in the audience

492
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:20,810
yeah so if you are an experienced
programmer and maybe you have your

493
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:25,360
source code kind of in a bad way and
don't have really weird kind of

494
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,780
dependencies is that gonna show

495
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:38,720
program so I wonder how much how many
programs so that the thing I like about

496
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:43,419
my job working on a specific piece of
malware you kind of get to know the

497
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:47,940
other personal things going on there
because you see what he did ride with it

498
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:51,590
wrong sometimes you you see what he
thought would implement specific bit and

499
00:51:51,590 --> 00:52:01,490
you think I would have done the better I
mean sometimes it's unclear what's this

500
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:06,089
next video did this actually makes sense
especially when it comes to garbage code

501
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:19,840
when you find one for the code in the
binary dunno

502
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:32,240
thanks for imprisoned station I'm
impressed I think most guys I guess like

503
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:46,339
to find their ways behind the shortcuts
behind whatever protection you got some

504
00:52:46,340 --> 00:53:02,440
protections self indicating well I mean
someone dies on me

505
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:10,720
trials or shakes that that could be
effective to actually

506
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:21,730
mitigate the effects actually trying to
accept all these predictions that fire

507
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:25,010
protection of the machine

508
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:31,830
protection against infection the machine
and the user's state of course of course

509
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:40,590
countering the controversial sort of
possible to detect millroy actually by

510
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:47,700
the fact that it trust you what's being
done just that the funny thing is that

511
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:52,580
this is not pursuing legal thing to do
is just the same as antivirus the text

512
00:53:52,580 --> 00:54:00,250
runs on Packers run some focus on jobs
are not malicious so actually is not per

513
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:06,730
se in the killing Miller in other cases
it doesn't like 98% of the cases but

514
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:10,720
then the 2% cases our group is off with
your security solution because you're

515
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:15,240
detecting their product there is sort of
one another using random Packers and

516
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:20,549
using virtual machine detection using
all sorts of stuff and they want their

517
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:22,940
their legitimacy of the products to run

518
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:30,490
machine in lawsuits threats of lawsuits
against security companies because they

519
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:35,220
detect this obviously delicious thing
that wasn't malicious after all because

520
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:38,439
it came with a license agreement

521
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:47,099
thank you

522
00:54:47,099 --> 00:55:06,569
that cold sure I wasn't quite sure of
the author was serious with what he was

523
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:12,979
doing or not because it is easy to embed
code unproductive code within the

524
00:55:12,979 --> 00:55:17,058
product of cold it looks as if it were
productive if you just have like blood

525
00:55:17,059 --> 00:55:22,839
for branch which branches which are
always true

526
00:55:22,839 --> 00:55:27,799
is like perfect occasions for replacing
coal in there which is never executed

527
00:55:27,799 --> 00:55:31,759
because the branch always go to specific
way in there the other one they have

528
00:55:31,759 --> 00:55:35,059
analysts like going study for the
Cardinal checking the branches breaking

529
00:55:35,059 --> 00:55:38,809
the code and he plays like interesting
stuff in there you know it's there

530
00:55:38,809 --> 00:55:44,849
forever and analyze all the garbage and
out of us find out that this was like

531
00:55:44,849 --> 00:55:51,640
last time they are garbage colorful off
curves but it was a mother after I would

532
00:55:51,640 --> 00:56:02,460
love curves obviously

533
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:15,270
examples of monolithic design and no
leverage wondered whether the two

534
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:23,180
mistakes and no lingering they seem like
they would be at odds

535
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:29,919
so the layers are speaking about the
Miller that the binary 31 binary with

536
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:35,670
different layers of the monolithic
design the young have won by three

537
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:44,440
different countries the most action I
could imagine wineries one caring about

538
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:48,790
the persistence one caring about the key
logging when caring about the

539
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:53,930
screenshots dealing and the expiration
on caring about the communications sites

540
00:56:53,930 --> 00:57:00,069
we have different priorities with
different objectives themselves are not

541
00:57:00,069 --> 00:57:05,440
like heavily pregnant triplets did they
don't have this layer of protection

542
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:12,650
telling you don't have a specific number
traced but look like shit in the

543
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:19,220
software with a lot of evasion is built
into the binary this usually takes big

544
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:22,319
teams of developers and a lot of money
that's being put in there which is

545
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:28,700
usually not brought up with other
criminals but fire national institutions

546
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:35,558
any specific

547
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:41,979
talk was very interesting I would just
like to ask you mentioned that sand

548
00:57:41,979 --> 00:57:48,879
boxes are usually I would just like to
hear from you because I guess you spent

549
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:54,759
a lot of time analyzing kojak Sri detect
and not executed sandboxes how would you

550
00:57:54,759 --> 00:57:59,660
suggest go back to signing a sandbox now
would be actually better extracting the

551
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:08,939
malware in to execute a friend there
there would be very rich boxes they have

552
00:58:08,939 --> 00:58:14,279
their use as a most members not aware of
the emotions running until I work for a

553
00:58:14,279 --> 00:58:22,509
company which has their own sandbox and
they're pretty successful 44 bitter

554
00:58:22,509 --> 00:58:28,660
moment detection with the combination of
books of behavior and studies teacher

555
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:34,390
sent box design study analysis and pick
the of the binary and have some big

556
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:38,618
famous reputation and pick different
information sources about your P's

557
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:44,329
mother and try to come to a conclusion
with a sandbox loan your last longer on

558
00:58:44,329 --> 00:58:50,789
Wednesday to improve sandboxes like as
you saw your did your mother to just run

559
00:58:50,789 --> 00:58:56,869
a specific date or to search for user
profile with Blake Facebook daughter

560
00:58:56,869 --> 00:59:03,109
which goes back in time for at least a
year like something human something that

561
00:59:03,109 --> 00:59:09,589
the samples can't make up and then the
sin taxes actually and I haven't seen

562
00:59:09,589 --> 00:59:16,349
any study like there is Eliza's which
represent the binary

563
00:59:16,349 --> 00:59:21,210
in the different different level and
managed to follow the execution managed

564
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:26,759
to find specific bits which could
indicate he's kind of vision techniques

565
00:59:26,759 --> 00:59:30,529
but I haven't seen any of this in two
predecessors smart enough to actually

566
00:59:30,529 --> 00:59:44,339
find click the real things that refined
in the mower

567
00:59:44,339 --> 00:59:53,430
just added just out of curiosity my
perception and a lot of this in terms of

568
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:57,200
looking at it is that commercially
written spyware would probably be a lot

569
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:06,960
of times more complex than what I B
correct her on the bed that the

570
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:15,049
complexity and the economical successes
never really connected by posting the

571
01:00:15,049 --> 01:00:18,739
thing is if you want to survive in the
Masai Mara market for a long time you

572
01:00:18,739 --> 01:00:23,049
need a lot of Asian refineries are being
attacked and your own business week

573
01:00:23,049 --> 01:00:30,099
which have been around forever they have
a lot of development time so there is no

574
01:00:30,099 --> 01:00:34,739
husband continues the developed over
time and still others in fact like

575
01:00:34,739 --> 01:00:43,849
random jeans and deal with random
security solutions also equities after a

576
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:47,390
specific company with specific machine
specific installations they could be

577
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:52,129
like sloppy version because the near
there was nothing to be sorry for her

578
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:59,170
the target so explain where the
complexity is likely a different one

579
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:11,359
example of a BTU tax I have the
impression that the ruling by someone

580
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:15,660
who knew how to write divisions knew how
to implement application and he sees

581
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:20,890
after which was like beautifully
structured and multi-threaded and Lake

582
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:25,310
very good exception handling in regard
to the future

583
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:30,680
I'm you see that there was a software
developer there another script so this

584
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:39,790
may explain why once more complex than

585
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:48,230
so let's start by giving

586
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:51,080
thank you very much
