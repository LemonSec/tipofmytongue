1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,420
there are two things that I'd like to
bring to your attention the first is

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,620
that in your registration bag you should
have gotten this you might mistake this

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,390
for religious propaganda if you don't
look very closely at it this is from the

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,240
International Church of the weird
machines we believe that every machine

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,990
should have the right to at some point
in his life

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,709
running next late and so we include
instructions from Sirte clever things in

7
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:37,600
here we've got puzzles in the back we've
got a centerfold in the middle which is

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,170
the schematic diagram to the electronic
of this is said that PDP 11 that I

9
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,469
picked up you would not believe how
difficult it is to Google the proper way

10
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:52,160
to typeset a la tech centerfold you get
all sorts of images but nothing related

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,788
to typesetting we've got a ceremony in
here that it that you think a little bit

12
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,189
we've got all of these images streetcars
from the eighteen nineties that had

13
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:07,580
different creative ways to push
pedestrians out of the way when they

14
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:14,110
collided ways to communicate between
virtual machines we have articles from

15
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,080
some of the talks that you'll see at
this conference and because they're

16
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:23,750
written on paper there are a lot faster
to work through and then trying to go

17
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:29,049
through video where to go through your
notes to please look through here and

18
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:34,350
and read the fucking paper because we
spent a lot of time writing it

19
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:42,530
this this is siamese . so if you like it
the the raw files are available on the

20
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,740
inside front cover are the instructions
for printing your own and there is no

21
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,229
copyright and you have a blessing to
copy it is fired as wide as you like

22
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:56,908
this is our 10th religious we have nine
more where this came from and they're

23
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,159
all fun with the children's Bible
coloring book and get proof of concept

24
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,800
get the fuck out we have an academic
issue coming up soon I managed to get

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:14,280
the word fuck into an academic CFP and
spent a life dream of mine anything

26
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:21,970
nearby no starch press called Python for
kids are there any kids here who would

27
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:29,900
like to learn programming I'm scenes in
rather old children are there any

28
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:37,049
legitimate kids know whether any pair
are there any illegitimate kids are

29
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:41,480
there any parents are legitimate or
illegitimate kids other the appropriate

30
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,700
age to learn programming ok now put your
hand down if you're so much of an

31
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,839
asshole father that you do know how to
program have not talked your children

32
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,030
seriously who who will give this a good
home

33
00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:01,220
you go

34
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:08,630
when I was growing up I first learned
basic from a book like that and then

35
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:14,070
they all ran out of print in the late
eighties and for many years there was

36
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:20,019
nothing and kids retired to shut up and
click on the mouse or do word processing

37
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,490
and call that computing and i'm glad
that this dark time is finally ending in

38
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,010
their books worth reading again without
further ado we're going to talk about

39
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:38,500
protocols for live events very very well
known but it is a very well-respected

40
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,120
science fiction book called a canticle
for Leibowitz

41
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,810
mechanically is a Catholic prayer leader
of its is a Jewish last name a canticle

42
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:56,130
for Leibowitz is about monastery that
was founded by jewish electrical

43
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:03,560
engineer who after the apocalypse after
nuclear bombs fall and civilization

44
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,350
falls with it he joins the Catholic
Church and create a monastery to smuggle

45
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:16,870
books to preserve them for the future
and the book takes place over 1,500

46
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:23,460
years in which civilization barely
recreate itself from the ashes as this

47
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,799
monastery is preserving books for the
long haul

48
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,289
so we're going to be playing with HOF
radio this is the sort of ham radio that

49
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:39,370
works over international boundaries so I
can transmit a signal from my house in

50
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:45,090
the United States and I can share that
here in Sweden I can transfer to South

51
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,609
America forget a little bit better
antenna I might be able to reach Asia

52
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:55,120
this is a great way to how the
international communication without

53
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,000
relying upon infrastructure this does
not need access to the Internet this

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,810
does not need anyone else's equipment
except for my translator and whomever

55
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:13,810
else is receiver to function at the same
time there are rules I have a license to

56
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,340
transmit on these frequencies but I do
not have a license to use cryptography I

57
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:26,159
do not have a license to transmit
content I can't play music I can't tell

58
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,750
stories I can have a conversation of a
personal nature but they have

59
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,509
restrictions here in this lecture we're
going to discuss different ways that you

60
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:39,840
can hide a secondary message while on
the surface having a perfectly

61
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,580
legitimate normal message as far as
anyone who's intercepting it sees you

62
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:53,389
and I are talking internationally about
my new antenna antennas 20 metres such

63
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:58,169
good antenna and I love my new in town I
didn't like my old antenna and as we

64
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:01,430
doing this there is a secondary channel
in which extra information is ticking

65
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:08,680
through and the point of this is less to
actually send data recently although of

66
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,900
course we do want some of that in case
of the apocalypse but also to understand

67
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,989
this protocol in what specifically to
understand the reviewers of this

68
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,470
protocol

69
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:28,950
as we go in we are going to review a
whole bunch of things that we did with

70
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:33,920
digital radio physical layer and it
turned out that the physical layer is

71
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:40,810
not monolithic at all and it presents
many opportunities to play with its

72
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:47,270
different elements and so even though
we're talking about bootlegging and

73
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:54,930
mature orcas as a way of embedding
messages on hiding things out we are

74
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:02,600
really talking about parcels that's
interesting right you say a radio I say

75
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:09,890
a parser and when you say a parser I say
this is the machine for executing date

76
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:17,080
now it is a machine to be program which
can affect that we can I Drive it from

77
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:22,719
state to state by supplying crafted
input and of course every exploit worth

78
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,700
the name is just that it's a way of
programming a machine with input and

79
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,599
guess what

80
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,890
parsers our buggy so you can make
parsers do interesting things and that's

81
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:43,550
the foundation of our discipline if you
will but really was our partners to in

82
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,960
the two are driven into their states
which of course a little different from

83
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:54,690
my processor States by what they receive
there is a trick to this because this

84
00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:00,979
isn't all that much extra state right in
a typical software program there is so

85
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:05,280
much extra state that you can stick
numerous during machines in there and

86
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,039
execute arbitrary code which of course
happens to your systems

87
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:17,920
everyday at the hands of teenagers
nation states and all that

88
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:24,720
but human shield on radio are simple
machines they don't have all that much

89
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,680
extra state so we should look for other
surprises then extra state in browsers

90
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:39,760
so we're not talking we're talking cats
we're talking sneaky little cute tricks

91
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,800
and allow those sneaky little cute forex
is what are called partial differential

92
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:53,089
right there are two ways to build a
weird machine one is feed a system some

93
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:59,750
input and haven't run away eloped with
your input it might actually get to full

94
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:06,110
touring although of course this is
nearly never required for effective

95
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:13,090
exploitation but a more sneaky way is to
send a message that has seen him two

96
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:19,380
different ways this is important the
whole of the Securities Kings depend on

97
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,850
the same message being seen exactly the
same way by multiple recipients you know

98
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:31,780
your CA she's your ex 509 a Certificate
Signing Request and it interprets ename

99
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,350
out of that in your browser

100
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:41,070
had better see the same name you were
Android gets a package and verify the

101
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:46,600
signature and as it turned out with the
Android master key bug

102
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,150
the part that verify the crypt signature
so a different message than the

103
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:56,459
installer so god knows what you
installed out while you're crypto

104
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:01,250
verifier told you that it's fine it's
signed by a trusted authority so what

105
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,190
good is equipped to signature if you
disagree about what's being site

106
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,380
two-parter differentials are deadly

107
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,870
and important as sneaky

108
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:19,640
all of this happens in noiseless
environments right the input that gets

109
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:25,380
to your machine is exactly the input
that's transmitted to your machine in

110
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:32,300
fact there is this extra variables which
is called noise bring in the noise bring

111
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:38,079
in defi funk rate the famous Broadway
musical

112
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,540
well the thing that makes Fri so much
more interesting than software

113
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:48,219
expectation is that five his noise all
over the place in those machines that

114
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,700
you bill and those machines into digital
radio that you can drive are driven by

115
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:59,140
noise as well as by what you transmit so
we've got a bunch of tricks one of them

116
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,670
was Pakatan packet right

117
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:09,550
the endless stream of symbols that your
radio pulls out of the air and then

118
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,540
matches into your frames

119
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,719
how do you know where we're afraid
starts over there is a marker it some

120
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,540
bites there is little machine in your
radio that matches those bites what

121
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:29,839
happens if those bites get damaged by
noise whale what happens is that you

122
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:36,840
never know that the frame started to you
the confidence of it are still noise

123
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:44,340
what if the frame contains an exact
representation in its payload over here

124
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:50,460
if you as it should be in that stream
are symbols well you would play this

125
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:57,060
internal frame you would receive that
internal frame your receiver would lock

126
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:03,439
on and you would receive it would
receive a frame that was sent without

127
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,240
using a radio

128
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:11,279
just by controlling the application
layer isn't that interesting so you can

129
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:17,760
inject from layer 7 down to layer 1
remotely without having your own radio

130
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,750
show your injecting a rock packet
controlling only a cat picture or a text

131
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:28,080
message in another network without being
nearby are having any physical access or

132
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,940
any privileges to control the low-level

133
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:39,120
all of because of a minor protocol bug
at the lowest layer in a piece of the

134
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,339
protocol that you would never see on a
packet capture because it's considered

135
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:52,370
too low level and this works there is
more there is error correction of course

136
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:57,420
so your codes that you receive
over-the-air network to predetermine

137
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:03,229
points in the coding so what happens is
your radio receiver is rewriting what

138
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:08,089
the medical entrance apparently the
signal that you are receiving on the

139
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:15,690
assumption that the noises random noises
not random or if you control the timing

140
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:21,720
of the signal you can actually feel the
error-correcting code rewrite your frame

141
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:30,709
series Shira frame in which no single
bit was as sent by the transmitter

142
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:38,060
reflect on this our example code for
this works by sending the message off by

143
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,130
181 noble half of a bit

144
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:50,970
and the way that we're able to do this
is that the symbol size in a total of 59

145
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:59,660
for is one simple contains four bits and
it's implemented by having 32 chips

146
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:06,980
which chip is like a lowest level 10
just 32 chips in a row and these chips

147
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:14,210
sequences are just the same thing
rotated so it is used then say a one and

148
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,350
you left shifted by a little bit in time
that's a too little bit more and it's a

149
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:24,190
three little bit more before and this
allows us to create a signal that the

150
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:29,240
lowest layer has none of the bits in the
message we intend to inject but the

151
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,570
receiver automatically corrects for it
and this lets us bypass a lot of

152
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:38,820
filtering that was used as an early
defense against this technique

153
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:43,610
filtering for the strings that we use
for injection and are no more effective

154
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,550
here than they are in stackoverflow
article on how to reenable magic quotes

155
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,500
in future before and good luck

156
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,990
building and wireless ideas for this and
exploring all the different ways that

157
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:03,540
you can hear a packet because of noise
so hopefully by this time will convince

158
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:09,630
you that up by his party service by
which are colloquially known as

159
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:15,110
receivers and that's why has really
interesting effects that do not occur in

160
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:21,720
any other partners anywhere here is our
mission city we're out to study those

161
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,330
parsers where I'll just study of those
receivers and our mission statement is

162
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:32,060
to boldly go construct signals that one
could send with a committee transmitter

163
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:38,880
that would appear every unikom what did
your receiver but will contain messages

164
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,840
that another standard receiver will
interpret differently

165
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:51,370
again you can cause step off that's not
our goal our goal is to build something

166
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:56,290
that reveals the hidden properties of
the receiving schemes and architectures

167
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:05,589
but of course book legging is good you
know some of those containing forbidden

168
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:13,890
knowledge insight but would prefer to
think of it this way here is a signal

169
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:20,830
our book laying bare and if you're
running through one receiver say am on

170
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:27,960
top then you get the beer if you run it
through another easier like FM you get

171
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,850
the books

172
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:42,520
clean schizophrenic radio polyglot
orthogonal to each other when the barest

173
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:48,230
sounds like a very clean there and it
doesn't look suspicious in any way to a

174
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:53,590
human operator AHF modems are sort of
unique in that the operator will often

175
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,880
have the sound turned on

176
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,490
will be listening to the modem noise and
will be looking at a waterfall in his

177
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:05,760
console as he selects which signally
ones this is different from dial-up

178
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,369
modem where you hear the modem lines as
you're connecting and then it goes away

179
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:15,989
and it's hidden from you so wish I
thought but

180
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:21,900
that of course is exactly the
interesting thing to explore here the

181
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,309
thing about radio circuits is that they
are built for a certain modulation

182
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:33,770
protocol vegan or every other physically
fit in the signal the physics doesn't

183
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:39,540
interfere with the physics of this
particular modulation receiver working

184
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:43,879
and this is done for very good reason
because as far as the modems efficiency

185
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,100
goes your receiver should reject
anything that isn't data but isn't data

186
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:55,309
doesn't matter when you have popping
from interfering audio signal or when

187
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:59,290
you have the atmosphere fading in and
out all of those effects should be

188
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:04,159
ignored as effectively as possible and
the protocol designer is trying to make

189
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,470
his protocol as error tolerant as
possible and this is exactly what we

190
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:16,170
will use as a wedge will use as a wage
first Azera correction error correction

191
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:24,260
is pretty much a necessity because
you've got to fight but it's actually a

192
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:29,059
machine for transparently rewriting the
signal so we will use that feature and

193
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:35,370
also will use the fact that those
encoding used in Legacy protocols are

194
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:40,020
quite loose and forgiving they were
designed for human operators who make

195
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:48,870
mistakes so encoding is easier to spot
then deeper fight rick's than regulation

196
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:55,860
tricks but we'll show you bought a
visual code here the bigger

197
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:03,199
carrying capacity troops will be
illustrated by a bear the finer

198
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,389
cure but also lists carrying capacity
tricks will be illustrated by

199
00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:19,859
so before we jump in we're going to
review the basics of 5 our pledges to

200
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:25,279
radio operators untrained signal
processors here but this we need to

201
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:31,829
revisit that was blueprints for how you
transmit information on the radio

202
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:36,099
generally you know how do you transmit
information on the radio you've got

203
00:19:36,099 --> 00:19:42,079
amplitude frequency and phase you know
all you've got is sites like all you

204
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:47,829
need is love will you get us signs so it
in the top one is the signal itself

205
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:52,469
that's what you want to put on top of
your carrier CD that you have amplitude

206
00:19:52,469 --> 00:19:54,079
modulation which is very

207
00:19:54,079 --> 00:20:00,450
get stronger and weaker on a particular
frequency in order to transmit your

208
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:06,399
information and an FM what you do is you
you change the actual size of each wave

209
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:10,789
in order to vary the frequency while
keeping the power reasonably consistent

210
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:16,149
doing the FN won the the envelope stays
about the same size and the end when the

211
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:22,458
envelope is changing

212
00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:32,299
there's also saves and phases kind of
tricky just think about when you're new

213
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:39,690
to this phase isn't something that you
can generally recognized an audio

214
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:45,389
the sign you're hearing or a coup sign
right and it's also difficult for the

215
00:20:45,389 --> 00:20:50,129
receiver to figure this out in absolute
terms so fisher king is always relative

216
00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:57,928
is the phase different for this bit from
what it was in the previous bit LY two

217
00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:02,570
children for how the transmitter works
is that it seemed abrupt point the

218
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,790
signal jumps from being the sine wave to
the cosine wave

219
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:13,030
of the same position will get back to
how it actually works in a little bit a

220
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:18,450
little bit but the gist is that you
can't abruptly jump from one value to

221
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,200
another because that makes the signal
discontinuous so you have to sort of

222
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,880
slowly ramp down to zero volume and then
come back up and you can actually hired

223
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,750
a channel in that as well

224
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:38,990
edition by training I know very little
about circus so for me the world of

225
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,970
radio consists of sine waves right for
some reason due to the physical

226
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:50,990
properties of the world so you can make
a sine wave that carries and of course

227
00:21:50,990 --> 00:22:00,190
it's just a thing right you can control
amplitude frequency or phase which means

228
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:06,570
that there are three places to put your
signal and again from my you the

229
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:13,030
receiver does this free a transformed
and ethics tricks the signal out of

230
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:18,389
those carrying frequencies which are so
useful for caring but are irrelevant or

231
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:23,280
actual information transmission so you
know you can vary the frequency with

232
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,889
time while your carrier jugs away and
you have this sort of a wonderful

233
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,740
diagram which is standard in the tools
which you would think that does a

234
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:42,540
Fourier transform will in fact doesn't
quite then you can vary the frequency

235
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:48,659
and show you see that the signal varies
around the signal for the central

236
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,740
frequency

237
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:59,440
you can vary the face and when you look
under the sign of the frequency and the

238
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,210
face

239
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:03,800
well they're they're not quite a
thorough going alright whatever happens

240
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,740
happens

241
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:11,360
team side of the argument over the sign
now that creates a ban that's one of the

242
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,820
concepts are they really struggled with
until I understood that really you've

243
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:24,230
got the fastest rate at which your
signal changes way out there that gives

244
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:35,710
you two sides plus or minus the
frequency of the change to your central

245
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:44,160
frequency that's a band and it is going
to be important again for forward we do

246
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:51,550
because we're going to deal with the
so-called upper sideband so I'm not a

247
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:59,830
mathematician by I am ham radio operator
in our view these things work a little

248
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:06,540
bit differently in amateur video for
long-distance communication something

249
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:13,740
called upper sideband is the most common
modulation and upper sideband it is

250
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:19,740
a bit confusing when you're first
building radios is circuits in terms of

251
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,280
what something will look like on the air
with the audio you're listening to look

252
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:29,760
like as it was a radio signal episode 10
is the easiest to reason about because

253
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,070
in upper sideband it you're just taking
a chunk of radio spectrum and you're

254
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:39,780
moving it so that it's now in audio
spectrum and you're doing this without

255
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:47,280
any stretching so if you hear of one
killer hurts phone the radio frequency

256
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:54,790
of that is one killer hurts more than
whatever the dial says in your radio the

257
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:59,740
other advantage of this style of viewing
it is that you can actually hear what's

258
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,830
going on

259
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:06,139
FSK it sounds like two tones that are
bouncing back and forth between the very

260
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:12,520
very quickly and that's because in
frequency shift keying the transmitter

261
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:18,360
is sending one frequency for a wine and
a lower frequency 40 and in audio these

262
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,909
two are far enough apart that you can
hear the difference

263
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:28,250
CSKA sounds different PSK sounds like a
whistle wobbling just a little bit and

264
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,610
the reason why it wobbles is that the
amplitude has to drop down to zero

265
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:37,800
before the phase can be inverted so you
know you're not hearing the phase you're

266
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:43,389
hearing it the filtering effect of
making the phase legal to transmit I

267
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:47,460
would make noises to illustrate this
except for some reason everything that

268
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:55,550
they tried to sing comes out the same to
the Magic School Bus so this upper side

269
00:25:55,550 --> 00:26:00,470
then again could be confusing unless you
think of it this way you need to stick

270
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:07,910
all this information into your band so
the broader europe and the faster your

271
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:13,630
signal Kenji inch so the faster your
data rate but you don't get twice as

272
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:16,559
much space as it turns out because

273
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:24,070
it's kinda like sitting on the subway
spreading out you can actually cut out

274
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:31,330
the other part in restore the wrist of
it because they are symmetric though the

275
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,799
reason why is that

276
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:38,639
in a.m. as you mixing the singles
together you get two copies of the same

277
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:43,100
message you get a copy above your center
frequency and you get a second copy of

278
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,269
the exact same data beneath your center
frequency in the other direction in

279
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:50,669
single sideband modulation you just
filter one of these out so that your

280
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:56,429
only transmitting on the upper half were
only on the lower half just think about

281
00:26:56,429 --> 00:27:02,379
you know cutting every human entering
the subway in half and then using a

282
00:27:02,379 --> 00:27:12,769
mirror to restore the other half space
close enough right now we're going to

283
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:19,440
get down to our specific protocols we're
considering three people here we have

284
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,009
Alice and Bob are trying to have a
conversation and we have the Eve who is

285
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:30,179
eavesdropping on the conversation now
keep in mind this is amateur radio so

286
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:35,700
Alice and Bob will not be using
cryptography and the eve has plenty of

287
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:42,299
bandwidth to record all of the
conversations that are going on even

288
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:47,330
isn't really restricted by technical
capability or networking links it's the

289
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:52,820
atmosphere that connecting them and
making everything easy to monitor and so

290
00:27:52,820 --> 00:28:03,970
because that's what is used again to
understand just exactly where the places

291
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:09,149
to hide the signals are in the
possibility to exploit the differences

292
00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:16,129
between the receivers is as though our
ttyl also called rudy is military

293
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:18,860
protocol from the 1940's

294
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:28,649
when when Global's is writing to Hitler
pretending that he was able to airlift

295
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,730
enough food to Stalingrad this is the
machine that would have carried the

296
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:41,920
information protocol began to be used in
the nineteen seventy use with post-war

297
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:49,230
surplus equipment that was purchased at
scrap metal shops and then brought home

298
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:57,620
and used over the air it features a very
low frequency difference to your

299
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:03,389
transmission is only about a hundred and
fifty hurts wide and it works by having

300
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:08,429
a low-frequency 40 at a high frequency
for a while and then everything is

301
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:16,460
encoded with five bits of data no parity
bit and to stop this this sounds like a

302
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:21,250
10 14 different serial port
configurations it's because these serial

303
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:27,429
port protocol is descended from this
protocol their ticker tape that you see

304
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:32,110
you on the right side of the screen
actually contains a message that would

305
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:36,889
be fed into a mechanical typewriter like
this you type in your message to punch

306
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:41,610
the ticker tape and then you can replay
it over the air in order to transmit a

307
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:46,280
prepared message this way you spend less
time on the air

308
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:50,399
keep in mind that they didn't have very
good buffering back then to the ticker

309
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:56,350
tape is the only way for the operator to
operate it live without having to worry

310
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,530
about

311
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:04,370
typing too fast for the machine in
modern days you use a program called FL

312
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:12,719
digi or one of its competitors and these
are available for iPhone and Android so

313
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:19,290
you can play with us on your phone and
actually send a message across the room

314
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:25,680
by turning the volume up loud here at
the bottom we have a waterfall this

315
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,620
particular screenshot is taken while the
radio is transmitting sue the only thing

316
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:36,459
that you see is your newly constructed
signal the left vertical line is zero

317
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:42,760
and the right vertical line as a one and
the operator tights his text into the

318
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:50,450
blue window and then receives texts in
the yellow window and the transmitter

319
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,930
will actually run live just a little bit
more slowly than you can conveniently

320
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:59,820
type so you type ahead of it catches up
with you in this allows you to have a

321
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:04,760
live conversation it would in theory
when you actually listen to what people

322
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:09,570
say over this protocol it is more boring
than anything you would imagine they're

323
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:13,730
just hitting these macro keys that are
in the middle and the macro keys send a

324
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:18,750
pre-prepared lists of things so you hit
one macro and it asked if anyone is

325
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:22,470
there he had the next macro and brags
about your equipment you had a third

326
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:26,930
macro and it says you know kind regards
to you and your family but this

327
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:35,970
conversations over the other part is the
two different frequencies for the big

328
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:40,120
frequencies but the radio is tuned to
and there's a serial port to connect the

329
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,280
computer to the radio so that the
computer can read to the radio over on

330
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,610
the right is another frequency and
that's the center frequency of the

331
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:54,550
retransmission that's actually used
that's the audio frequency plus the

332
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,700
radio frequency

333
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:03,670
and this is audio that you can share so
you begin hearing it bounced back

334
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:08,380
between the two farms in the nineteen
seven news they use this for ASCII art

335
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:14,700
this is Seattle Slew the winner of the
kentucky derby in 1977 or any other

336
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:22,530
course I'll come on is it not clear
which one is this is dad was a horse of

337
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:29,710
course but this is not mister EZ the
alphabet used is this protocol is it

338
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:38,480
predates ASCII so in this protocol you
have five this you have 26 letters and

339
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:45,770
you also a couple of symbols like
carriage return newline feud but then

340
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:52,910
you have your numbers separate from your
letters and the reason why the numbers

341
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:58,570
are actually increasing order is because
on the keyboard they were the top row

342
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:04,419
like the one in the queue Kirisame the
to the WTO with the same and the Machine

343
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:09,280
and actually know whether you're typing
letters or symbols it just remembers

344
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:15,070
when it sent the shift the shifts
outlined herein green instructed the

345
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:20,600
receiver to switch to the figures
alphabet or to the letters alphabet now

346
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:27,250
the other thing that happened in ww2 Liz
that the city Union forgive me sergei

347
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:33,930
kind of sucked at manufacturing radios
at the same time their alphabet is

348
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:38,980
different from our alphabet so they
needed to add new letters

349
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:51,580
so jealous don't know if you have the
text for vodkas and you have those exact

350
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:59,059
will call them bites if you have that
preceded by the letters bite then you

351
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:05,149
get the text for vodka if you send the
figures symbol first then you get

352
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:12,830
exclamation mark 974 it stays semicolon
9 the there's actually a letter for who

353
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,629
the fuck are you

354
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:21,629
WRU and then it does a leper n and a
dash and then the bell rings

355
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:28,589
there's a null byte there was never a
used in the original protocol so what

356
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:34,100
they did was they added support for the
third alphabet through the night so when

357
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:38,639
you say nothing happens on a normal
reading machine but if a Russian ready

358
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:45,540
machine it switches from latin fucked to
a Cyrillic fund and there you go you get

359
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,909
give up because yes little bear he gets
his vodka is happy to the point of

360
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:58,660
asking politely and by the way I noticed
the bear right this encoding trick can

361
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:03,149
carry quite a bit of the payload so the
other thing that I told you was that

362
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:07,170
this is a protocol intended for live
operation you have a human operator

363
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:14,300
sitting at a keyboard typing so what
happens when the human operator types

364
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:22,609
too slowly in this case the letters
symbol doubles as an idol tone so as

365
00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:26,690
you're sitting there doing nothing which
does happen you'll see on the radio

366
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:30,650
where some guy is it is keyboard and
he's typing and then he gets distracted

367
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:34,530
and walks away from it and they're just
these two vertical lines running

368
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:39,150
on the display until he comes back to
his radio and shuts it off so this is

369
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:45,300
important because you've got to push 31
symbol for second this is a different

370
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,490
rate but it's tough to keep up the rape
this is fifty letters per second I

371
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:54,439
believe you just keep sending letters
tone over and over and over again and as

372
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,900
far as the mechanical machine is
concerned you're just remaining at the

373
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,430
letters are coming but you can also make
these you can have letters followed by

374
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:05,290
figures followed by figures followed by
letters and at the end of the day you're

375
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:09,160
back where you started the physical
machine will clench around a lot of the

376
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:15,040
physical machine crunches around and
make so much noise that it's normal the

377
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,910
standard digital receivers will just
ignore the redundant shifts so there you

378
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:28,129
have a whole caravan of beer is this is
an engraving from leaking century by

379
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:36,940
somebody who reportedly has been to
russia and draw those from nature but

380
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:41,430
left imagine that these are real and the
Bears passing through the village

381
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:47,290
well imagine each bear carry a payload
of books an earlier draft of these

382
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:53,520
slides had Vladimir Putin shirtless
writing one of those barriers rights so

383
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:00,890
this is a simple encoding trip right now
we are going to get to modulation tricks

384
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:05,370
as well but for now how about another
protocol

385
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:12,259
case 31 is what we did the majority of
our experiments and everyone has a lot

386
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:16,570
of advantages over really really was
designed in the nineteen forties and

387
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,000
uses

388
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,280
uses frequency shift keying PSK 31 was
designed in the nineteen nineties and

389
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,460
uses phase shift keying a side effect of
this is that the signal is a lot more

390
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:34,030
narrow you can have many more
conversations in the same audio channel

391
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:38,160
with upper sideband it if you're
transmitting and I'm transmitting and

392
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,910
retransmitting on on the same audio chat
channel but in different audio

393
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:49,290
frequencies the singles just combine and
on the receivers and both of us

394
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:54,370
appear in the waterfall and the receiver
can just choose either your audio

395
00:37:54,370 --> 00:38:00,380
frequency or my audio frequency to
select a conversation because this is

396
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:04,960
only thirty one body and because its
phase shift keyed the single is only

397
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,420
about 60 Hertz wide which means that
they can be packed a lot tighter than

398
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:14,630
ready we're transmission is a hundred
and fifty hurts wide and you need extra

399
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:21,190
separation on top of that the same
software is used so FLD Gwillim

400
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:28,340
implements both are ttyl and PSP 31 and
a lot of other protocols but here you

401
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:33,390
have one vertical line instead of two
and it's the phase of that signal

402
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:38,339
instead of the frequency of that signal
that includes the information

403
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:45,350
31 works by in hurting the phase 2
market 0 and you do not invert the phase

404
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:54,310
2 Marco won the the waveform on the
upper right is exaggerated is UN plan it

405
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:57,549
this way it sounds horrible although it
does work

406
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:02,670
the one on the bottom it is exactly as
you would see in the air show 2012 you

407
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:09,540
just have a sine wave 20 you have a sine
wave that you changed to a co sign in

408
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:14,100
the middle I just imagine that you have
two generators of a sine and cosine can

409
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,670
switch between them now

410
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:26,340
from those speakers standpoint when this
little sine wave just abruptly changes

411
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:31,070
direction that's the equivalent of the
speaker physically moving outward and

412
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:35,920
then being abruptly yanked back by the
magnet in the opposite direction and

413
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:42,670
with as much force as the speaker can
handle their similar effects in radio

414
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:49,010
the result is very broad-band noise and
it hurts to listen to not only doesn't

415
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:54,290
hurt to listen to it but it interferes
with nearby frequencies to in order to

416
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:58,990
keep everything narrow you don't
abruptly invert the phase instead you

417
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:03,540
drop the amplitude so this signal here
goes down to nothing and then it comes

418
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:09,650
back and it is scale you can't see it
but as it's come back it's now co-sign

419
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:14,780
instead of a sign and the actual
transition between cosine and sine

420
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:24,520
happens exactly here when the signal is
80 after two you decode it if you recall

421
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:29,230
that a positive times of positive is
always a positive and a negative times a

422
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:34,530
negative is always a positive and that
the only case when you multiply two

423
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:40,800
things that the result is negative is
when you do a negative times of positive

424
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:49,150
you can do this to figure out whether at
that moment in time the phase agrees

425
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:54,500
with the past moment of time so you
delay the signal and then multiply it

426
00:40:54,500 --> 00:41:00,490
with itself and it will only jump over
the zero line if the phase has changed

427
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:04,779
so for the change phase you get
something greater than 0 and for the

428
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:09,120
unchanged phase you get something less
than zero and this allows the receiver

429
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:14,920
to pick out the best this is how a good
receiver works this is not the only way

430
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,970
to build a receiver

431
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:21,899
again think of it as a circuit that does
just this for you and ignores everything

432
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,210
else

433
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:29,700
31 also has a different alphabet now in
the nineteen nineties asked if he had

434
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:36,629
won out over a dick and the other
alphabets Unicode was not yet around so

435
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:43,460
but as he still isn't very efficient for
English text Morse code for example is

436
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,390
designed it so that the letter is the
shortest letter this is because it's the

437
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:52,779
most common in the English language and
lower case letters are far more common

438
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:57,170
than upper case letters there's no
reason why a lowercase letter should be

439
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:03,520
as long as an uppercase letter this is
the PSP 31 alphabet and I'm going to

440
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,490
zoom in a little bit to show you some
specific samples there are some rules

441
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:13,279
for these one thing I noticed is that
the lower case letters are always

442
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,720
shorter than the upper case letters it's
a matter of efficiency

443
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,029
the other thing that you'll notice is
that no letter ever contains more than a

444
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:27,080
single zero in a row the reason why is
that this is a variable length encoding

445
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:32,380
do we need to know when one letter and
then the next begins and the rule is

446
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:37,130
that whenever you see 200 you chop it
off there and whatever is in your buffer

447
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,570
is the letter

448
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:44,210
on the receivers case they're just left
shifting it bringing the new bits in and

449
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:48,430
then whenever they do you see two zeros
to chop it off and they throw it into

450
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:56,490
the character buffer and that's why I
never contain more than 200 every every

451
00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:01,680
one of these will begin with a line and
end with a one there's no tricks that

452
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:08,680
you can do you can vary the idle count
to hide data so normally you have two

453
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:13,520
zeros between letters but you had three
or four it still valid by the protocol

454
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,910
and this happens in the air when the PSP
31 transmitter is idling in the same way

455
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:20,430
that the ready

456
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:28,020
protocol we'll just repeat the letters
characters in Titletown also illegally

457
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:34,280
long letters are ignored so in the
nineties the author of this protocol is

458
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:43,220
British asking is an American code he
wanted to send the the symbol for pound

459
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:49,779
sterling looks like an Al so he couldn't
because this is in the upper half of a

460
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:54,020
ski and he did it included in his
original code so we decided to do was

461
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:59,830
just include the entire upper half of
ASCII as letters that were longer and

462
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:03,569
the reason why he did that was that the
receivers would ignore these long

463
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:09,890
letters and if you didn't have an
updated receiver running the newer

464
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:15,120
firmware they were just be one letter
missing we can do the same thing we can

465
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:19,319
make them a lot longer we can have as
many bits as we like as long as we don't

466
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:25,010
have 20 bits in the end to end it and by
running off the end of the buffer we can

467
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:29,070
then put a legitimate character at the
end and take a lot

468
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:37,080
traffic with full usage of the available
bandwidth without anything appearing on

469
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,529
the eavesdropper

470
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:44,330
so you know how is that for a caravan of
beers those protocols are essentially

471
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:53,529
built for having site channels but these
are still encoding tricks let's do more

472
00:44:53,530 --> 00:45:02,410
interesting 125 notice the cats now when
you're working with this you have a

473
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:07,759
radio and a laptop and you run an audio
cable between them some very fancy

474
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,080
radios will do this internally but not
many

475
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:17,590
this is what the audio sounds like what
you're listening to now is part 3 of

476
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:22,490
Electra series then britain on how to
implement PSK 31

477
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:27,009
the lecture series is in PSK 31 and I
will be transmitting it on twenty meter

478
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:29,990
so

479
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:36,359
you know this is a a one-color hurts and
the the strength of the tone keeps

480
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,880
bouncing up and down

481
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:45,980
so this was produced by a Python script
that I wrote and this is a Python script

482
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:53,519
that you yourself can recreate in a
weekend or two with some good coffee the

483
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:56,950
way that you begin is that you have your
audio rate

484
00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:03,299
generate these as 48 killer herds WAV
files which is slightly off from the 44

485
00:46:03,299 --> 00:46:11,210
doubt one CD Zia's this is just to make
the numbers lineup accurately and she's

486
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:14,819
a volume that makes the sample go up
about as high as it can go without

487
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:21,109
clipping I then have a divisor because
I'm not trying to make the single as

488
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:25,910
fast as possible I want to make it
around a one colored stone so I divide

489
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:32,118
my audio rate by a thousand and that
gives me the the length of the sine wave

490
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:38,890
and then the length of a symbol to know
how often to adjust my face and that's

491
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:45,000
the audio rate divided by the bard rate
of over eight years 30 1925 because we

492
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,700
have thirty one and one quarter as
samples per second

493
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:53,890
just about how fast you typed and then
have an index in for lou that runs

494
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:58,640
through and creates all of these
evaluate each given point and then I

495
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:05,589
have a phase which is 0 for sign and 14
closed sign it when you first of many

496
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:06,810
you get

497
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:12,240
something sorta like this in the middle
of your ear loop and it sounds

498
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:17,399
absolutely horrible because you're
violently changing the phase and shaking

499
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:24,060
the speaker so what you do is you filter
it you drop the phase down to zero if it

500
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:28,009
will be cheap you drop the amplitude
under zero if the phase will be in the

501
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:33,360
morning and then you bring it back up on
the other side and that's as much as it

502
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:38,740
takes to generate the signal and then of
course you need a radio to shifted into

503
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:47,220
the actual radio range now if you don't
filter then what you're getting is this

504
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:53,950
in your wonderful reason you're getting
this is that you Fourier transform has

505
00:47:53,950 --> 00:48:00,710
edge effects when you are break off one
wave and start transmitting another with

506
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:06,300
non-zero amplitude you get all kinds of
frequency is springing up from this

507
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:11,900
switch and this is the reason why it's
not done not only with their break your

508
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:18,450
speaker it would also pollute the air
waves with the receiving Fourier

509
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:27,100
transform see all of those artifacts and
seeing them as changes of the signal

510
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:31,460
that is just a changing of the frequency
that is to say sine waves of you never

511
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:39,820
meant to sent in real pesky 31 you drop
the attitude for each 0 when you're

512
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:48,390
flipping the phase so if you look at the
envelope of the signaling in da city you

513
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:53,629
can actually tell where the zeros are so
every place that the amplitude drops

514
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:59,780
down 20 each one of these little pinched
places in the in the envelope that's

515
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:04,520
where 0 is and with regular spacing
reverie you don't have that that's a 12

516
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:09,690
in his recording you can sort of pick
out the bits yourself yet so I mean you

517
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:13,930
see a bunch of one's for example a
single unbroken packet

518
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:18,859
there so I was grabbing some drinks with
fellow by the name of Craig Hafner and

519
00:49:18,859 --> 00:49:24,460
he mentioned that he had implemented PSK
31 receiver but that he didn't really

520
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:31,869
understand or carrot to develop and
debug the time-shifting method to the

521
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:36,089
way that he implemented it was that he
looked at the amplitude and whenever he

522
00:49:36,089 --> 00:49:39,900
saw the amplitude drop that was a zero
and whenever he did not see the

523
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:45,790
amplitude dropout was alone and he had a
working receiver this way so you can do

524
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:51,900
a trick to encode data by looking at the
difference between those two

525
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:56,200
implementations to his implementation is
a little bit inefficient but it is able

526
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:03,299
to receive tsk 31 signals from the wild
so so what is inside of a wine you drop

527
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,569
the amplitude anyways

528
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:10,520
a normal receiver not craig 30 but
anyone else's receiver won't notice the

529
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:15,210
difference but it's still measurable if
you look for it so you can build a

530
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:22,210
receiver that operates both normally and
with Craig's method and then mixes that

531
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:28,660
you like X or the bits of the disagree
in order to identify hidden message so

532
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:35,149
on the top we have a normal transmission
on the bottom we have the exact same

533
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:42,030
letter but with all of the ones pinched
down 20 both of these are interpreted as

534
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:47,339
the same message by legitimate
implementation of PSK 31 so there you

535
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:47,960
have it

536
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,150
a sneaky kitty

537
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:58,710
the other thing that you can do is you
can combining these combined these

538
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:05,440
signals with out whatever part they
ignore that's the part that you had

539
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:14,069
imagined so this here is PSK 31 Morse
code a polyglot because

540
00:51:14,069 --> 00:51:21,808
31 only cares about the phase and Morse
code only cares about the amplitude this

541
00:51:21,809 --> 00:51:29,359
is the actual diagram of the letter K
which is da da da

542
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:37,150
dash dot dash that's what the waterfall
looks like this is what it looks like as

543
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:44,069
an envelope and then we can break it
apart into the sounds of the letter and

544
00:51:44,069 --> 00:51:48,690
I'm going to play it for you and you can
actually hear the entire callsign come

545
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:50,400
through the transmission

546
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,079
that's the wrong one

547
00:51:54,079 --> 00:52:11,180
interpreted correctly

548
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:17,868
that last one is actually the audio file
of the magazine that you've been given

549
00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:25,180
the PDF be played in AM Player or VLC of
course why release another version that

550
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:34,210
is not a polyglot between Morse code in
PSP 31 you can also do it between 31 and

551
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:40,890
RTTY I mentioned that are ttyl is a lot
whiter than PSK 31

552
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:47,430
RTTY cares about the relative power
between the two frequencies so the way

553
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:53,339
that you build a receiver is that you
you split the region apart and if

554
00:52:53,339 --> 00:52:59,470
there's more energy in the ones calling
them the zeros column have a 10 Collins

555
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:01,890
you have a zero

556
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:08,129
normally the transmitter will have the
channel either entirely on were entirely

557
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:14,550
off but you don't have to implement that
way instead you can make the stronger

558
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:20,180
column just stronger so you send me be a
hundred watts in the right channel and

559
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:28,910
use and 11 on the left channel when you
do this you can also embed PSK 31 in the

560
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:36,279
column itself so the the left column
will be a little bit wider than it

561
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,359
should be the right column will be a
little bit wider than it should be on

562
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:44,598
the receiving end you wind up with QPSK
31 conversations and one RTTY

563
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:48,270
conversation at the same time and in the
same amount of bandwidth and of course

564
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:53,900
the receiver circuit built for one or
the other will get one or the other

565
00:53:53,900 --> 00:54:00,109
right this is wonderful because this
really tells us what those receivers do

566
00:54:00,109 --> 00:54:05,569
and of course more modern protocols use
the same building blocks for their

567
00:54:05,569 --> 00:54:14,779
modulation again the frequency or phase
shift end that way we can search hope to

568
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,130
start understanding

569
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:20,370
more complex protocols and how to play
with them as well which is of course the

570
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:24,270
whole point of this trick but again

571
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:30,360
physically there should be clear with
soot and face do not really affect each

572
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:37,670
other so you have two orthogonal
channels to send your to send one to

573
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:42,400
send your message in the other to ignore
you can also hide data in channels that

574
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:48,010
are designed to be ignored for example
for error correcting codes are designed

575
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:54,970
to fix the damn packet one that has been
damaged accidentally by interference in

576
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:59,899
Duke's did this DEFCON about a little
bit more than a year ago they did it for

577
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:05,970
protocol called 8065 which is designed
for bouncing messages off of comet tails

578
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:13,480
and BTW 65 is mostly error correction a
correction is actually the majority of

579
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,420
the message and the reason why is that
you're not trying to get a lot of

580
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:20,710
information through you just want to get
a little bit of information very

581
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:22,360
reliably

582
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:26,660
what they did was they calculated
exactly how many bits they could flip

583
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:31,730
and where to know that their message
would be corrected back by the receiver

584
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:36,570
and then they've destroyed the error
correcting capability of the protocol

585
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:42,820
but they've added their own message to
the side and an eavesdropper will

586
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:48,930
incorrectly believe that he's received
the correct message or you can bounce it

587
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:52,379
off of a closer comment

588
00:55:52,380 --> 00:56:00,140
so the idea of messing with error
correcting codes or any other techniques

589
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:04,348
here is that actually reverse
engineering the message to determine

590
00:56:04,349 --> 00:56:07,660
whether or not there's a hidden polyglot

591
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:12,618
gonna graphic message should not be that
hard but good cools don't exist for it

592
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:17,240
so if you would like to play with this
is sort of processing one of the things

593
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:24,758
that are like to challenge you to do is
to take QPSK 31 message which has a

594
00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:30,069
retraction tsk 31 does not but QPSK 31
does they had an extra fees for that

595
00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:37,910
take that and damaged a few bits
intentionally making message that's not

596
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:45,808
correct and then make me a tool that
will tell me whether the message has

597
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:50,809
been because of accidental damage or
because of intentional damage can you

598
00:56:50,809 --> 00:56:55,130
recognize specific bits that were
intentionally run by the transmitter and

599
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:59,640
we're not caused by noise and how do you
do it reliably and how do you do it

600
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:08,509
without false positives as 14 deserved
for dessert I'm sorry you know you can't

601
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:09,410
have your

602
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:11,940
or putting until you've eaten

603
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:18,950
I mean yes so as we were working in the
experiments for this we did a lot of

604
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:25,589
them through a radio station that I have
in philadelphia and I have an antenna

605
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:33,230
that runs the entire length of the roof
and I also have an Ethernet network to

606
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:39,770
connect everything together and I mostly
use this equipment remotely and sure

607
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:46,650
hands how many of you have wired
Ethernet wiring ok keep your head up

608
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:54,670
keep your head up right now take your
hand down if at any point when you wired

609
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:58,130
any know where you realize that you
could just make the wires a little bit

610
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:01,060
longer and it made it so much easier to
do even though you know the proper way

611
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:17,240
no lying now so I think one hand is
still up in the back I sure that when

612
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:23,600
you unless those wires they're no longer
a twisted pair for that portion and a

613
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:32,990
little bit of noise can sneak out also
there are these really cheap Ethernet

614
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:36,430
switches that you can buy for home use
that like you know really shouldn't be

615
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:40,000
trusted but the traffic seems to get
through anyways you don't see any

616
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:47,820
dropped packets so what's the big deal
is the Madeline protocol the idea here

617
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:56,010
is that data runs over Ethernet supposed
that the attacker controls a bit of that

618
00:58:56,010 --> 00:59:01,200
data but not very well for example you
might be connecting to my hidden service

619
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:06,490
over tour as you're connected by hitting
service ever tour I control a couple of

620
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:11,069
things I control how much data goes to
you in that I can

621
00:59:11,069 --> 00:59:15,249
give you a larger download rather than a
smaller download and I can control the

622
00:59:15,249 --> 00:59:20,799
timing of that because I can insert
delays in my own side so I send you like

623
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:24,279
a lot of data and then I get kinda
stingy and I don't see much data for a

624
00:59:24,279 --> 00:59:29,319
bit before you time out and start
sending data again this never goes

625
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:34,288
across your network unencrypted so I'm
not controlling the robertson the wire

626
00:59:34,289 --> 00:59:40,349
or anything like that all I'm
controlling is the bandwidth usage I'm

627
00:59:40,349 --> 00:59:46,359
able to crank it up and down now I also
want to exaggerate a signal that suppose

628
00:59:46,359 --> 00:59:51,589
that I control this hidden service and
you are protecting their hidden service

629
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:59,229
and I want to know where in Stockholm
you are well if the wiring is bad it's

630
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:06,058
not too hard to do this what you do is
you get a bunch of trucks with shortwave

631
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:10,859
receivers if you drive around the city
that you suspect the fellow is in and

632
01:00:10,859 --> 01:00:14,299
then you very the traffic to send Morse
code

633
01:00:14,299 --> 01:00:22,420
this is a photograph of the letter K as
transmitted from my house to my friend

634
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:31,380
down the street by the way that this was
transmitted I had VNC session open so

635
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:38,209
I'm remotely using my graphical desktop
SSH is normally better but sometimes

636
01:00:38,209 --> 01:00:42,019
when using graphical tools you don't
have a choice right so government VNC

637
01:00:42,019 --> 01:00:46,390
session open and i'm looking at the
radio receiver and I saw this really

638
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:55,868
annoying line near 28 at 120 megahertz
so I switch over to another virtual

639
01:00:55,869 --> 01:01:01,869
desktop and my client machine so now the
VNC traffic has stopped because my

640
01:01:01,869 --> 01:01:05,959
client knows that I'm no longer paying
attention to that display the line goes

641
01:01:05,959 --> 01:01:10,759
away the line goes away and when I moved
back as soon as I move back to look at

642
01:01:10,759 --> 01:01:15,329
it again the line comes back to this
lying showing whether or not I paid

643
01:01:15,329 --> 01:01:17,160
attention to the screen

644
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:22,950
just so happens that traffic over the
Ethernet network creates interference on

645
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:29,569
28 at 120 megahertz and it does it in
proportion to how much traffic is going

646
01:01:29,569 --> 01:01:38,038
across so for this test case I moved
away from the screen then I moved back

647
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:44,210
and I time it I can wait a few seconds
and then I moved back to another screens

648
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:49,430
in the line goes away and then I moved
back and I do just one second

649
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:53,140
keep it shorter and then I moved back
wait a bit

650
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:56,529
go back to you three seconds again and
by doing this I'm able to remotely

651
01:01:56,530 --> 01:02:04,680
inject Morse code into a foreign area
controlling only the magnitude of the

652
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:10,940
traffic and none of its actual contents
making an accidental transmitter out of

653
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:16,819
the wired network and all of this with
just a little bit of countries to bare

654
01:02:16,819 --> 01:02:25,520
wire networks properly

655
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:32,930
the other nifty thing about radio I
mentioned that cryptography is not legal

656
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:38,720
under way radio a few other things are
not legal for example it's not legal to

657
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:45,240
hire a transmitter to intentionally
obscured position but this is a town all

658
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:49,259
the time it's called a fox hunt will
take a transmitter you're hiding in a

659
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:52,840
city you'll ask everybody to go around
trying to find it and then you grab

660
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:59,080
years afterward and it's a ton of fun
show you're not allowed to hire message

661
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:06,230
to obscure its meaning unless it's fun
and you're grabbing beers afterward so I

662
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:11,260
have a 20 metre transmitter in the
Northeast United States this can

663
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:15,330
transmit to the entire western
hemisphere it varies by weather

664
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:20,470
conditions and that sort of stuff but I
would like to do is a sort of capture

665
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:26,629
the flag competition in which everyone
who's interested throws up an antenna

666
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:31,780
and starts playing around with different
signals trying to make little crack me

667
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:36,840
signal signals and then reverse
engineering them if you like to play

668
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:41,850
along in transmitting you need an
appropriate amateur radio license fees

669
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:50,529
are available after an easy exam in most
countries if you just want to receive

670
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:55,780
you only need shortly receiver that can
handle upper sideband the cheap ones

671
01:03:55,780 --> 01:04:00,710
will not do it but the high-end models
are able to you can also pass along

672
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:05,800
audio recordings between each other and
so far as I know this will be the first

673
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:10,640
intercontinental capture the flag game
that did not involve the Internet or any

674
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,950
public infrastructure of any kind

675
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:23,879
so we're a bit over time picking up but
we would like to leave you with these

676
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,240
conclusions

677
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:30,680
first of all we would like you to C
five's in a different light

678
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:38,200
you would never look at the Phi and she
justified you should be seeing a whole

679
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,000
bunch of little machines

680
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,240
a whole bunch of physical tricks that
make it work and connect them and of

681
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:52,979
course all the little tricks that you
can actually play 150 seems to have

682
01:04:52,980 --> 01:05:00,790
acquired this image of a black box right
you basically plug two black boxes into

683
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:04,570
computers these are your radios you
can't mess with them know they are

684
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:12,270
pliable they should you miss pursuant to
a local laws and regulations of course

685
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:22,589
and simpler protocols like PSK 31 and
retain demonstrate pretty much all the

686
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:29,200
features of the grown-up protocols like
AG 28211 and $115 for and of course

687
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:33,660
you'd much faster software-defined
radios to play with those but it's

688
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:39,200
actually possible to play with these
with nothing other than you were a sound

689
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:47,470
card and you can connect your laptops
using a sound while you're in create

690
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:50,209
your signals and pipe

691
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:55,839
and all while you're doing this for
those parts of differentials look for

692
01:05:55,839 --> 01:06:01,810
methods to make the same message
appeared difference to different

693
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:07,549
receivers they are found they should be
understood and we should not actually be

694
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:15,030
building any of the Internet of Things
or other such like dreams before we

695
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:21,599
actually understand otherwise of course
we run the risk of these things turning

696
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:33,050
into an Internet of things that explode
and last but not least you really want

697
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:38,800
me understand the protocol or a format
when you have learned to abuses and when

698
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:49,670
you learn to actually hide things in it
and you can do that not only in PDF JPEG

699
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:58,270
WAV files and others that the previous
versions of the POC or gtfo electronic

700
01:06:58,270 --> 01:07:01,560
editions have explored you can actually
do it

701
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:15,680
fine with digital radio so there thank
you

702
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:27,078
impressive finding their machines like
everywhere is this is really interesting

703
01:07:27,079 --> 01:07:30,150
to hear that antenna from here

704
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:37,839
yes you can to see this as a receiver
you need shortwave receiver capable of

705
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:41,859
single sideband mode if you don't have
this if you just go to a store and

706
01:07:41,859 --> 01:07:46,480
biennial Charlie receiver it will still
sort of work on a good day

707
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:52,220
you then you have very long stretch of
wire for transmitting on this band it's

708
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:56,000
the twenty meter band and you need to
have that wavelength so for transmitting

709
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:02,869
I have 10 metre long antennae on my roof
but you don't need a particularly good

710
01:08:02,869 --> 01:08:08,010
length for receiving so you can instead
is taking a long straight wire running

711
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:13,540
out of your window to a nearby tree and
buyer that into your radio and listen on

712
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:17,839
the right frequency in the right time
I'll be tweeting the time and the

713
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:23,160
frequency you for anyone who likes to
play along but there's no information

714
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:29,830
and not yet scheduled to broadcast
originally we were going to perform this

715
01:08:29,830 --> 01:08:36,460
on the 10 metre band and then the Sun
decided it hates mean so now we're doing

716
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:41,239
it on the twenty meter band which is a
lot more reliable also I'm not sure if

717
01:08:41,238 --> 01:08:50,718
we gotta do you know how to track people
using tor the Madeline thing is included

718
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:55,069
at the end of our article on a subject
which you can find it in the previous

719
01:08:55,069 --> 01:08:59,850
edition packaging tape though they just
look at the file name at the bottom of

720
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:05,420
the front page subtract one for that
Google flat file and you'll find written

721
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:08,740
description of the Madeline protocol and
the

722
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:17,319
GSK 31 gloves and of course you know
everyone has been talking about 20

723
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:25,080
commissions and spyware and then spying
on those in this is the whole tempest

724
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:30,800
kind of thing but it turns out that you
don't need any of expensive toys to

725
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:38,290
actually hear that this happened
accidentally and it took as I recall a

726
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:43,170
bit to figure out but then we had to
have a drink it was it was infuriating

727
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:50,819
as this annoying interfering signal only
appears on the exact band that I need to

728
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:57,330
use and I mean there are harmonic from
it but 28 2012 a mega herds is where

729
01:09:57,330 --> 01:10:03,430
most PSK 31 conversations happen on the
10 metre band so whenever I was using my

730
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:06,970
radio I would have interference and
whenever I switched to another virtual

731
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:12,970
desktop the interference of go away but
I couldn't see what I was doing well you

732
01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:20,000
know your your made could replace your
cable without actually putting any chips

733
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:30,180
this in turn could do about wiring are
all interns evil people do bad wiring so

734
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:35,660
questions from the audience all the way
down there you guys can try to pick out

735
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:36,650
books

736
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:41,650
meanwhile didn't know now we gave the
one book

737
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:49,089
you wanna get this book away are you
planning on sneakily laundering have an

738
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:55,409
accomplice in the audience that you like
I'm just curious to hear if this

739
01:10:55,409 --> 01:11:03,839
anything of this is achievable in Kerry
Wood carrier wave y su W

740
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:11,960
PSK 31 Morse code polyglot is
effectively in CWE you're doing more

741
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:18,909
than a simple carrier wave in that
you're inviting its phase but it's valid

742
01:11:18,909 --> 01:11:24,739
in carrier wave receiver so if you have
someone who's monitoring say the Morris

743
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:34,120
area of the spectrum he will see the the
Morse code message and not the PSK 41

744
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:41,780
message the reason why you wouldn't
normally do this is because carrier wave

745
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:47,030
transmission is supposed to be narrow
band and it's just a very narrow just

746
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:52,860
the carrier whose even thinner than a
PSK 31 transmission when you combine the

747
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:58,330
two if you do this to hire messaging
start transmitting the receivers will

748
01:11:58,330 --> 01:12:02,659
notice that something sounds a little
bit off in your message and a lot of

749
01:12:02,659 --> 01:12:07,059
them are still doing their Morse code by
hand and without a machine you will have

750
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:14,440
twenty different retired Morse code
operators jump into the channel to start

751
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:18,219
trying to diagnose blood equipment
probably you might have or to suggest

752
01:12:18,219 --> 01:12:22,199
wiring changes that could get rid of
this interference and at the end it will

753
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:28,199
draw a lot more attention to your signal
than you would prefer to have

754
01:12:28,199 --> 01:12:35,869
so yes you you can use these techniques
with CWU Morse code transmissions from a

755
01:12:35,869 --> 01:12:39,499
practical standard it's not what I would
choose during a zombie apocalypse so

756
01:12:39,499 --> 01:12:50,150
this is the vehicle of doing right this
is scooter and the stereotype that have

757
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:55,978
to use their hands to use these what
you're trying to avoid when you're

758
01:12:55,979 --> 01:13:00,800
experimenting with these verticals is
you don't want a group of very talented

759
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:06,860
retired electrical engineers deciding to
spend their retirement hunting you down

760
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:14,339
to avoid that do not be a jerk on the
radio

761
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:19,440
you will find that you can do all sorts
of experimentation as long as you're not

762
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:25,449
adjourn you are a jerk then you begin to
get trouble to bring the microphone to

763
01:13:25,449 --> 01:13:36,580
the front question from gonna

764
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:45,200
person but I highly suggest you w think
you could send a different face and that

765
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:53,790
is yes you could see her suggestion is
that when you have one beat you get that

766
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:59,220
say inside you do your second be as a
cosine and then on the receiving end it

767
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:05,810
you do the the multiplication of the one
with the other fixed assets that you get

768
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:11,050
so that just like in PSD 31 reception
will jump above only if the phase

769
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:17,650
changes do you know how steady equipment
you would need for directly transferring

770
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:28,449
that quite steady ok with receiver need
to be as good

771
01:14:28,449 --> 01:14:43,579
the face every time you get a new people
alright I think we need to try this is

772
01:14:43,579 --> 01:14:48,719
also the limitation here so you're not
going to be pirating blu-ray discs over

773
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:58,130
this you're getting his CQ CQ CQ if you
want to do and you were happy to stomp

774
01:14:58,130 --> 01:15:02,709
on other users like the russians used to
do over the horizon radar on amateur

775
01:15:02,709 --> 01:15:06,579
frequencies and the only reason they
stopped because it's not like the guy in

776
01:15:06,579 --> 01:15:11,058
the mobility scooter can threaten Putin
on the bear so the only reason they

777
01:15:11,059 --> 01:15:15,409
stopped at Lowes the hands notice that
the signal sounded a little bit like a

778
01:15:15,409 --> 01:15:20,539
woodpecker so they started making their
own transmissions that sounded like a

779
01:15:20,539 --> 01:15:23,579
woodpecker and whenever they would see
the woodpeckers ago they would make a

780
01:15:23,579 --> 01:15:28,489
fake snow in reply er which was not as
strong as the original signal so when I

781
01:15:28,489 --> 01:15:31,999
get over the interference in their
perspective but from the over the

782
01:15:31,999 --> 01:15:36,139
horizon radar perspective it was as if
there is a code that didn't line up with

783
01:15:36,139 --> 01:15:41,090
anything and then their displays will go
to hell and then they decided to use

784
01:15:41,090 --> 01:15:47,559
frequencies of people who want to fight
back so look up the Russian woodpecker

785
01:15:47,559 --> 01:15:53,030
antenna pictures they're quite
impressive I mean imagine a really tall

786
01:15:53,030 --> 01:16:03,018
building made up of antennas sticking
out of a forest a rather tall for

787
01:16:03,019 --> 01:16:08,159
i mean the the only thing more
impressive is transmitting using

788
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:16,068
geological layers like the EOF channel
of connecting to getting in touch with

789
01:16:16,069 --> 01:16:22,859
your submarines underwater for that you
know you need a specific geological

790
01:16:22,859 --> 01:16:31,209
substrate and hundreds of miles of water
is not very kind to radio to radio

791
01:16:31,209 --> 01:16:36,749
engineers when they're referring to
people who are standing in the wrong

792
01:16:36,749 --> 01:16:42,179
place the call them bags of water which
remodeling perspective is not that

793
01:16:42,179 --> 01:16:50,390
inaccurate

794
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:56,400
real quick questions anybody tried to
hide stuff and it spread spectrum you

795
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:03,969
can you can do spread spectrum messages
that are beneath the noise so over short

796
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:09,580
ranges you can send a message like using
it as sort of a polynomial and saying

797
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:14,650
okay I'm transmitting on this channel
and a gentleman lmao yeah you can you

798
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:22,639
we're having patterns civilian GPS also
does this hybrid sprint spectrum to stay

799
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:28,350
beneath the noise and videos that in the
military and you're not able to get the

800
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:34,510
signal unless you know the hopping
pattern sort of there are loopholes like

801
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:39,380
if you have a good antenna that it
doesn't matter how much a weekly try to

802
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:42,880
translate because the gain of your
antenna you'll be able to see the whole

803
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:43,820
thing

804
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:48,880
peaking above the noise for similar to
how you would attack how you would

805
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,810
reverse engineer polyglot signal that
abuses error correction you just get a

806
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:57,410
really clean copy of it and then you're
able to distinguish between the

807
01:17:57,410 --> 01:18:03,730
accidentally corrupted bits and the
intentionally crafted this so you see

808
01:18:03,730 --> 01:18:10,269
the way we think about things these
things is you can emulate some fries

809
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:16,990
with others right and it'll be
interesting to enumerate all such

810
01:18:16,990 --> 01:18:24,480
relationships and disabilities so this
was actually what led to the stalk and

811
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:31,780
hopefully will lead to a few more you
know how to do how to do less with more

812
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:35,080
if you will

813
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:42,840
believes that it should be possible to
make a family tree of which particles

814
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:47,050
can be combined with each other's I
think that there's not enough whiskey

815
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:59,200
for us to complete the street on our own
we are we should be having a Kickstarter

816
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:08,200
project because we're running out of
projects are you intentionally intend to

817
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:17,679
blow all of the proceeds on alcohol ok I
think the end result of this is that

818
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:21,430
there's little books that you had here
in the nineteen fifties we had to get a

819
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:26,000
stamp or drink that these will then be
required by law in new hampshire where

820
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:33,990
she lives now

821
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:37,010
alright in that case thank you very much
thank you
