1
00:00:09,979 --> 00:00:13,119
so this presentation is about

2
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,570
searching for votes on the internet
scored points away visa payment on the

3
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,900
internet

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,349
uh... because

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,590
usually i hayes isn't going to write the

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,410
already on the internet network

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,840
and i hope that this to spotted white

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,540
acerbic

9
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,698
by introducing myself

10
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,970
and from what mocha

11
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,370
at wristwatch abound

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:41,089
and then probably the only occasion dot

13
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,160
and security researcher

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,529
uh... hotel sleep issues surrounding for
back which is a commission settled

15
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,560
the best

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,760
for voice over at the security issues

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,309
work scanner which is not
software-as-a-service

18
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,690
on

19
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,000
basically give it the idea address off
your pbx which

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,650
might be public facing

21
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,820
on the internet

22
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,559
and sends you back have a report

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,240
my research is not just the boat was so
correctly but sometimes uh...

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,869
i do a lot of research when it comes to
weather occasion security

25
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,229
whether the cation fire was

26
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:25,750
and the web browser security and very
his defense topics

27
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,460
and that's any of the security byron

28
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,630
any dispute

29
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,190
so we were talking about salute i'd be
introducing some basic propose for those

30
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,130
who are not familiar with sit

31
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,479
and

32
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,259
which show

33
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:44,680
how the internet explorer

34
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,980
went to wreck the devices

35
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,240
i've been talking about some ideas when
it comes to fingerprinting these devices

36
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,809
because the whole devices

37
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,330
that tell you what

38
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:59,030
uh... what they are running

39
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,730
some book about some strange behavior

40
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,940
handbooks

41
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,610
to monitor what others are doing

42
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,598
and will talk about briefly about what
the cybercrime

43
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:14,529
seems to be doing when it comes to
weren't elected

44
00:02:14,529 --> 00:02:18,799
so that no uh... michael with sars
supporting

45
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:21,269
fares to propose

46
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:23,040
and to do next

47
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,040
as they say is work some programs

48
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,439
according to both soon

49
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,478
here contact

50
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,429
and set

51
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:37,900
face some some people tell you district
looks exactly like the g_o_p_

52
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,019
and and it actually does effect if you
have to use a lied to me

53
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:43,759
which places and she

54
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,608
messages it's with the governor makes
sense

55
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:49,409
of six messages as well

56
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:51,978
because it has the same for my pc

57
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:53,569
uh...

58
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:58,629
and they're so i guess the controlling
indeed message for a month for it which

59
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:00,640
we use for remain so you have

60
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,010
from and to have this is about

61
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,418
uh... but it's quite different from it
should be initiative you have to

62
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:11,139
client-server motive uh...

63
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:12,859
it's almost like that

64
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,129
baat and said

65
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:20,948
you might have a request which is being
sent to bind the sick registrar said

66
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:23,019
that

67
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:24,229
and

68
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:25,319
so so woods

69
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,409
magicians seven different

70
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:32,429
usually the insists on sports are all
over

71
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,029
port

72
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:35,280
fifty sixty

73
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,469
you could be

74
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:40,019
but that's not necessarily the case of
course they convened s

75
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,989
and its supporters of the cv

76
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,279
and you might have support for thier
lessons learned

77
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:49,069
frontier this would be on

78
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:50,290
d_c_ people worked

79
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,149
fifty sixty one

80
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,529
you have

81
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:57,649
that basically contracts of

82
00:03:57,649 --> 00:03:58,909
entities

83
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:01,448
and two points which i don't usually

84
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,059
the phones supports

85
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:06,309
and you might have said

86
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:10,509
format that they're so you would have to
copy or normal medical

87
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:16,748
to wear to decide that and it would get
back to presence on the bundy inaccurate

88
00:04:16,749 --> 00:04:19,659
and then you have centers

89
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:23,680
uh... i've been talking about
registration proxies

90
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,710
registrar solo

91
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,388
uh... record restrictions set there

92
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:32,130
where and wednesday register with us

93
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,439
they usually use a vindication of course
so it's not necessarily the case

94
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,499
and

95
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:41,759
if they're not going to just exchange

96
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,629
extension one hundred

97
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:47,520
than any quotes and it won't work for
extension one hundred

98
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,378
one should be sent to

99
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:52,199
yet the internet's and and or not

100
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,900
associated with

101
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,820
uh...

102
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,270
deccan dept

103
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,378
extension

104
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:00,110
and then you have proxies

105
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,850
and parties and no and

106
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,060
wants to

107
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,110
speech scheider uh... sirf entities

108
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,750
and maybe there

109
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,659
it yet

110
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:13,090
when you have a uh... and i'd be pbx it
usually does the job of

111
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,638
bolstered registrar

112
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,370
and proxy server

113
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,310
is just an introduction

114
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,830
for those who are not coming in with the
protocol

115
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,789
then i suppose i said

116
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:26,960
and you know it's not it's

117
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,529
just like it should be an engineer had
followed debts

118
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:33,659
maybe had options

119
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:34,569
you have

120
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:36,339
invite

121
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:38,900
invite gets foam streamed

122
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,099
done correctly of course

123
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:45,520
uh... you have registered but i just
mentioned i just mentioned

124
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,049
the registered surveyor

125
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,039
packages that several support

126
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,610
diverges dramatically

127
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,200
and you have ruptures these are not the
only three of course but

128
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,840
they are the ones that i did not care
about

129
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,229
options gives you anis dot support at
options so we'll keep you wanna check

130
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,419
uh... within six to nine point

131
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:06,639
supports

132
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,349
certain that methods or certain

133
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:10,819
defendants

134
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:12,740
he would send in options

135
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,169
message

136
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:20,889
and these host usually looks like desire
an invite message

137
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:23,379
you can see looks richmond too

138
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:25,499
issue could be

139
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:30,479
you have to put the indication of an
invite you have we'd had uh... porting

140
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,609
in exp

141
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,550
for what

142
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,319
which would describe what codecs are
supported

143
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,270
on which forced the arctic deportees

144
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,580
and so on

145
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,120
um...

146
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,919
you have to do when from and best

147
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,659
but because i don't know about

148
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,779
about you can see that

149
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:52,719
and the from address

150
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:54,629
there except that

151
00:06:54,629 --> 00:07:01,629
and i'd be mentioning that there there
are

152
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,440
and you have a certain tests if you are
right

153
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,860
india instead of the pot invitation for
you and have approx

154
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:18,650
in this case you had said you are right

155
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,210
the basic idea

156
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,529
when when it comes to scanning for sip
friends

157
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:27,479
you to be devices

158
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,300
is to get a response back

159
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,679
but traditionally

160
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:31,750
we were accepted

161
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,520
for doing board scanning going you could
be worse than the

162
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,080
dot blank beckett's that and two
packages

163
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,650
and skipping tonight's he uh... eric

164
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,938
accident the response

165
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:46,970
but in this case this is is more

166
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,800
retirement

167
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,550
because what we do is

168
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,489
we send affected it was and that's it
message

169
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:58,438
we get something back then you know that
there's a sick

170
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,620
tax and it makes sense

171
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,550
you know that there's a certain departs

172
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,189
and it's relatively efficient i guess

173
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:11,760
you don't need to use my purpose of kids
who don't use to use

174
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,250
brought up it's necessary

175
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,909
uh... lengthen my cruise i will use one
subject

176
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:21,460
and gentle scanning done like that

177
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,789
and is the basic idea and the most basic
scad

178
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:25,750
type of scam

179
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,830
using options you you would get there

180
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,900
at two hundred ok work for a formal form
some sort of response which

181
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,079
makes sense when you interpret it

182
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,670
uh... s

183
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,890
as it

184
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,100
abuses

185
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,670
one message that night

186
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,969
came across the uh... it's not

187
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,919
microsomes generate

188
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,079
message

189
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,360
it's something that someone else

190
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
created

191
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,310
and to the costs and to a

192
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,410
transferable

193
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,110
so this is the basic idea uh...

194
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,540
is that they're going to start

195
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,740
what it does is it creates a and options

196
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,279
message and sends it

197
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,010
and if you get something back then you
know

198
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,430
it works

199
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,310
um...

200
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,609
and is what i'm talking about peace and
lots of six messages to different idea

201
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,820
texas bebu you determined by say shit

202
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,770
and maybe you do it on different sports
club

203
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,870
in my case i only used fifty sixty

204
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,270
and when you get something back then you
know

205
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:38,449
that didn't they resisted mess that sick
entity

206
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,210
so

207
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,030
which has been met

208
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:46,189
we can do phrase different reaches
pending on your

209
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,980
uh... preference

210
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,620
and began randomized dispense as well

211
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,050
so

212
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:58,569
you might want to render my services and
so that you don't six dcn

213
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,420
network for the time

214
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:06,520
and you might want to granddad random
brendan scanners lurches different

215
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,560
uh... what it does is

216
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,319
it's face

217
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,750
or like the excesses except

218
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,160
the ones that are prided or

219
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,439
uh...

220
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,140
got a note on the internet

221
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,730
on the internet

222
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,600
and discuss

223
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,660
their own internet

224
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,660
uh...

225
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,600
this is an idea that you tried to get
that sound good

226
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,660
of what's what's out there

227
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,719
so we can do and then skies we can do
scanned by idea just class

228
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,960
weekend

229
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,730
standby provide that who wants to go
there and i want

230
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:46,150
but we don't want to do that decided to
go for conference

231
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,340
return used

232
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,570
shall i be databases for that

233
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:54,320
and my case i was a bit lazy and i
decided to

234
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,470
to find a website which

235
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,510
doesn't vote for me

236
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,870
uh... one i have to do what's best for
the country of my choice argentina and

237
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,550
its case

238
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:12,490
pretty right

239
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,260
but that's fine

240
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:21,260
changed the format so that the pecan
rangers appoint beatrice

241
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,690
are used to following

242
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,530
help shoots randomized random the other
hand scan

243
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,470
and what's that

244
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,910
uh...

245
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,870
twinkled from about four

246
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,980
from about five

247
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,620
and as you can see

248
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,650
you immediately starts getting results

249
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:54,430
no argentina is actually not one of the
most busy

250
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,319
sitcoms arm

251
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,390
what some other countries actually give
you one

252
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:06,390
much much better zones

253
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,689
so i decided to check out what

254
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,620
my own country dot

255
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,570
which is a tiny country uh... there's
more people living

256
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:19,310
on the island and there are not the
addressee s

257
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,199
and i thought about that

258
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,810
their system there in eleven point
thirty seven percent problem replying to

259
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:26,660
my sister

260
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,969
messages

261
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,070
which horse quite strange because when i
checked the other countries

262
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,160
what's you chew

263
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,650
uh...

264
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,380
have some people and it seems that
whenever we're giving didn't give in and

265
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,120
i'd be address changed and you i'd be
interested in june

266
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,130
they make sure that we actually use it
sellout

267
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,630
so that's that's why it's such a high
percentage

268
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,689
uh...

269
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,980
and by looking at these results

270
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,220
i noticed that

271
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,700
one particular provider

272
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,920
one of the major ones

273
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,140
was actually the exposing

274
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,980
dvd where at

275
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,400
pep boys over at the surface

276
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,160
and to all of these are exposed on the
internet abated

277
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:19,140
that force kind of course

278
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,810
these are different depressed once
actually

279
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,560
the first three are for sure from this
provider

280
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,290
and their cable modem

281
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,130
devices which has a

282
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,939
and you can plug in your normal form

283
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,520
to dampen

284
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,110
here tonight

285
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,570
also looked at the unpopular once
because sometimes you find some

286
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,350
interesting place

287
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,130
uh...

288
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:51,530
however in this case i notice that
there's a lot of bridges so

289
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:56,520
i decided that i want to versions from
my statistics

290
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:02,010
and this gives so much more coming
overview off what's out there

291
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,280
arstan skits not unspoken sometime

292
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,670
would have imagined

293
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,310
and my country at least

294
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,550
uh... bombs

295
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,060
you and you find the prints three
mansour

296
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:20,369
and for example grad student that one of
the peace and

297
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,990
from school never get rage

298
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,500
rarity

299
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,230
also looked at than other countries

300
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,420
which seemed a bit mysterious to me

301
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,069
uh...

302
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,730
the numbers are quite different

303
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,600
unique user agents

304
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,579
is much lower

305
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:43,969
by scans the first one million packages
embryogenesis

306
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,630
and

307
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,620
most of them did not have

308
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:53,040
uh... main did not have a user id
because of what i was doing this i was

309
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,329
looking at the user-agent string in
which is a

310
00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:00,630
one of the heather's just like it should
be had this user-agent

311
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,840
or server

312
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,280
if any of these exist

313
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,350
i mean dump it stuart database

314
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,850
and in this case most of them don't have

315
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,690
don't seem to have user-agent

316
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:19,810
also interesting news uncw dot which
i'll be talking on paper

317
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,760
and the others are i'm not sure what
they are if

318
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,600
someone from the audience

319
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,889
notes uh...

320
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:29,840
the statement on it or not but i think
that

321
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:36,840
it's some sort of internet provider dot

322
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,589
so what about the norm

323
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:43,280
twelve percent still messages

324
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,579
i know it is that's

325
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,570
deal options message is not

326
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,200
is not being allowed to method not
allowed

327
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,299
and disease

328
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:56,220
quite strange because safari ptc clearly
states

329
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,230
issues

330
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,970
uh... support options to elicit

331
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,950
devices

332
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,090
and when you start scanning you find all
these different

333
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,110
uh...

334
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,530
na na received complaint or

335
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,790
different behavior

336
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,199
between different devices

337
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,320
but in this case it does us what

338
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,740
what that supports

339
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,010
and supports a very breezy

340
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:22,100
form on functionality invites

341
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,960
economics which is courted by invites

342
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,690
precedent by and

343
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,610
separate basic

344
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,980
soprano

345
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,030
what kinds of dozens expenses are ending
form

346
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:39,079
accents hangs up the call

347
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,440
whether multi jto

348
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,110
well i just thought you might

349
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,209
i don't fret

350
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:44,689
you guys are

351
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,230
uh... familiar with the italian ice
cream company

352
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,660
it really doesn't have anything to do
with that

353
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,939
uh...

354
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,970
it's just my user-agent

355
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:58,270
uh... my happens to be looking at and at
first when i took my user-agent

356
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,500
and accepted that spongy bone

357
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,810
uh... the reason why it changed

358
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,010
my user agent is because

359
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,849
some returned from smart

360
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:13,299
and different intrusion detection
systems are actually looking for

361
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:14,710
street st

362
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,790
secretions

363
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:20,869
friendly scanner which was my would use
images

364
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:25,579
i didn't want to get any nasty email
it's during my research so

365
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:29,590
i kind of changed east make sure that it
doesn't get caught by stuart

366
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,250
that's fine prime

367
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,110
i don't think i didn't get a nasty
mister stein

368
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:38,229
previously i did

369
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,260
then i decided to look at

370
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,760
somewhere near

371
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,710
and speeding

372
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:51,160
that's a very small echoing to my best
and i'd understand

373
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,549
twice

374
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:56,529
using different idea gets is of course
using randomization

375
00:17:56,529 --> 00:18:00,110
there's a small number of some devices
being fixed post but there's a high

376
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,199
number of

377
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,900
better to be two hundred

378
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,440
different user-agent

379
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,630
uh... almost eighty

380
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,559
then there's

381
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:10,509
sony's

382
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:13,490
projectiles what what these

383
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:19,340
links is seems to be relatively popular
but that's still a small number

384
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,759
uh... upstairs

385
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:22,930
seems to be

386
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:29,630
more popular than the other countries
that had checked

387
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:33,370
gone you have the usually is

388
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:37,459
usually use a region standard-bearer
since you did great

389
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,010
service providers

390
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:45,080
some interesting once some thursday
user-agent stuff from student loans

391
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,020
um...

392
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,200
but over the world so we have to return
to the world

393
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,700
uh... clerks

394
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,980
particularly friendly

395
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,929
templeton purple was actually putting
and user-agent string

396
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:02,990
was extra or surveyor

397
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:07,540
was actually putting difference mains of
different cities looks

398
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,490
quite interesting

399
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,430
but it's not just the both ports fifty
sixty

400
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,669
uh... you guys can either course of
course

401
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:19,169
especially six fifty sixty-one

402
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:23,600
uh... for example i have a small in
texas didn't read that for that and it

403
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,550
has to

404
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,030
different ports

405
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,940
in one forty penpal crop one form which
would be listening on

406
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,230
fifty sixty

407
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,250
the other one is on fifty sixty watt

408
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,490
dismal

409
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,919
uh... which is a skype a particular

410
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,370
and that supports it

411
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,830
gossip

412
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,629
and it's up to two cents on six four oh
six four

413
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,400
of course

414
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,279
you won't find too many gizmo uh...

415
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:52,420
photographs it

416
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,850
suppose

417
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,600
book on the internet because they would
usually be behind them eighty bucks

418
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,000
they're such big cases where you have
any t devices

419
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,020
that when you do and open connection

420
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,070
when you open up a connection

421
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,919
peep abuse and be polite

422
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,920
and the port plans on

423
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,630
an eighty devices

424
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,990
would be open before but over the import
of our own internet that goods are sold

425
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,710
it would be interested in that

426
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,580
for debates the nation at the entrance
but that would

427
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,908
except bands

428
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:29,350
they seem to be the cheaper ones

429
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:35,139
uh... and and this this could be quite
an issue i guess

430
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,500
because all these other methods are
there certain markets and

431
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,450
started talking about producer david or

432
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,470
and invites which i don't

433
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:48,910
your comment

434
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:53,960
and you might have to start the records
but it's not so popular

435
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,400
at least not knock on the internet

436
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,090
recruiter ex post p_p_ axis

437
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,669
mccarthy and its records which points to
your

438
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:08,960
and the idea is that when it didn't
someone wants to protect your pbx

439
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,080
it with the first checked the set the
record except for one more the pbx

440
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,010
it exports of pbx with justice pass at
the airport and demo quick to point that

441
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:23,010
when of course this information is
appeared before after one

442
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,650
not for trust legitimate users

443
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,760
so what weightlessness

444
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,330
interesting and of course market
research

445
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:35,970
some people might be more interested in
that stand out there is

446
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,750
but what we're interested in exactly the
opposite

447
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,710
and

448
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,830
it's depicts a groups

449
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,668
it gives you a good idea when someone's
comes out then sa's

450
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:50,919
paid eight do you think there might be a
the police told her i'd be wearing or

451
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:53,160
something like that

452
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,070
it can give you an idea of how to assess

453
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,908
how bad the situation is

454
00:21:57,909 --> 00:21:59,300
and it's kind of this

455
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,770
um... there's a lot of

456
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,670
cable modems out there

457
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,020
that are supporting sick

458
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,370
if you want to look at uh... by their
abilities and pbx is

459
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,909
you'll notice that there's too much less

460
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,559
pbx is being kicked exposed

461
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,620
chris morris there's gonna be

462
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,539
competition

463
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:22,500
at least when it comes to sit

464
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,099
and for example one article
vulnerability

465
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:29,860
uh... to digest the pitch i will be
describing expect much

466
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,149
over here about

467
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:35,570
basically this affects a lot of seven at
five point six

468
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:39,260
it seems to be a vulnerability and the
to proceed towards it

469
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,049
built-in bypassed by design

470
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:42,550
security issue

471
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:45,350
and according to my tests uh...

472
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:48,850
dinner that government of course

473
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,199
effects

474
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,590
around sixty percent

475
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,010
of the super bowls

476
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:56,980
and if you want to fight the later on we
can discuss

477
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,600
the security issue

478
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,850
and reports and once so we can get an
idea of how widespread dis whenever it

479
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,370
is

480
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:13,350
there despite the few use every god
there's quite a few such devices that

481
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,480
donuts value who they are

482
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,660
they tried to keep

483
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,920
keep it secret when one solution would
be fingerprinting

484
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,240
uh... the other solution would be

485
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,510
defended by force of course

486
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,650
but charts to go to the fingerprinting
technical solutions

487
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,310
uh... in this case

488
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,340
you can notice that

489
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,240
uh...

490
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,210
you notice a lot of

491
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:40,120
asterisk servers which had

492
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,629
user-agent which

493
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,610
would have been modified studing

494
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,320
combination or something like that

495
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,899
so

496
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,320
if you modify that there's ordinal peace

497
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,600
you've only

498
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,520
the fuel tank

499
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,030
is what when you say that span options
message

500
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,129
you get a response back

501
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:03,110
and didn't do ted into had that

502
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,269
and set by d

503
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:07,430
responded

504
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:12,270
and everyone seems to be generating base
in a different manner

505
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,879
so that's no standard way of

506
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,440
generating

507
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,120
this and everyone is including their own

508
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,189
uh... fingerprint x

509
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,210
so deep

510
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:28,750
indicates how much they risk but only
starts with a s and it's followed by

511
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:33,780
five or six hexadecimal numbers

512
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,840
and status decides some of the

513
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:42,199
fingerprints if you don't simply choose
to find morning databases

514
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,230
and two fishes of open-source

515
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,670
and

516
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:52,970
that's lots necessary even though i have
here is some devices don't creates

517
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,230
i think that sometimes

518
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,650
they should but they don't

519
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:02,049
so i decided to tickets for that and
look at other markets the order of

520
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:04,870
creditors is particularly interesting

521
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,270
in this case you noticed that

522
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,379
these two messages

523
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,310
have to see more debt

524
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,279
both are asterisk

525
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,120
messages

526
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,199
so if i put them percentage of their did
notice that fits

527
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,830
olympic unsupported are swept but the
rest at the same order

528
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,360
uh... in this case

529
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,860
because i decided to see sec

530
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,870
are infected

531
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,010
uh...

532
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,020
so it's

533
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,279
two seconds message is not an asterisk
messages

534
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,820
is something else

535
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,990
and that's one way to tell

536
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:43,980
between

537
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,900
once said one said entity and another

538
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,940
and it

539
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,510
sush movie shows you

540
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,580
dec except

541
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,240
crowded and the device name of course

542
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,669
so you might have to sink ships that

543
00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:02,789
on different devices different products

544
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:04,500
and you also have

545
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,630
uh... you can look at the case

546
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,059
so in this case

547
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:13,960
uh... the case of because i'd be in the
first place it's uppercase the i_d_ into

548
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,860
second place it's not

549
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,158
and you have all these differences

550
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,429
which are quite

551
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:23,300
uh... usually when he was trying to
fingerprint

552
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,220
uh...

553
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,419
so them i think about this inspectors

554
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:29,650
pretty passive

555
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:34,179
you can do expensively or you can just
use one beckett's to elicit a response

556
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:35,590
and aunt

557
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,189
then look at these soon get back it

558
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:42,380
when you tried to do fingerprinting once
you have to call the database and will

559
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,840
be working on

560
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,649
and

561
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:52,649
yes it's the shits discourse introduced
them and they shouldn't sleep issues

562
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,940
minded their way to solve that

563
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,010
people can submit there

564
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:59,710
their fingerprints

565
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,000
and it does

566
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,990
automatic

567
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,549
uh... regular expression generation

568
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:07,110
it's not uh... the best

569
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,010
are a few moments

570
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,570
but if that works

571
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:14,049
however errands issues two point go

572
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,220
which

573
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,760
the unity

574
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,620
uh... i hope to approved the sun awt

575
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,870
because the fingerprinting is quite

576
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,340
what's old reliable right now so

577
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,730
it's a vicious that won't go away and

578
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:30,330
actually wrote that part said

579
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:33,439
bart said which that actually works on
nyc

580
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,880
the version zero point whatever from

581
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,800
and that's that's just about
fingerprinting

582
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,100
tell us talk about some

583
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,060
strange stuff

584
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,290
um...

585
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:57,149
saying same here added just ask and you
would send slots ups register messages

586
00:27:57,149 --> 00:27:58,570
some reply

587
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,689
they would usually ask for
authentication or sell you hey you're

588
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,680
not going to race to get

589
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,720
and to get this information back

590
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,500
they could get registered

591
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,610
uh... you might get uh... for affordable
followed or something like that

592
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,310
but when you get that until k

593
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:22,320
it usually means that it's not ok

594
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,870
by two hundred ok what

595
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,709
it's means that you've got into stage
excuse that your scanner

596
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,500
was logistics to d_p_p_ x

597
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,150
and

598
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,780
or sip-it at the time

599
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,440
uh...

600
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,430
and uh... what happened in this case
uh...

601
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,080
account of what the lord

602
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,178
devices which went blank what's behind
it ok and say they're on during the week

603
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:48,350
bites that i was

604
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,949
second ohio sniffing my connection

605
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,750
and that was not a single subject ic
coming days

606
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,560
uh... which was not supposed to be
destined to my

607
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,970
i_t_n_ chips

608
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:03,179
uh... what what's happening was i was
getting

609
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:04,420
all this canning

610
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:09,710
going going on the internet from certain
i'd be addresses switch hazard actually

611
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,980
registered with my skynet

612
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,049
this meant that

613
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:16,730
for for me this meant that i got that

614
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,690
at handbook

615
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,450
uh... i could get more

616
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,960
surpluses it's

617
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,430
but of course um

618
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,770
i wonder what happens to be

619
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,129
to the people trying to use their

620
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,360
there and what's the point

621
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,549
it's

622
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:35,139
it's gonna create problems for sure

623
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,210
so i want to do that again

624
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,750
what about invites comes web

625
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:43,340
i'm not going to invite spencer for

626
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,720
uh... invite

627
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,850
that's false three

628
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:50,070
uh... in the case of deepak pbx

629
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,549
it might struggle proxy the implied

630
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:55,020
so it might strike to terminate d

631
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,870
for what

632
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,469
however many put most of the times

633
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:04,390
uh... when you try to review

634
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,320
accidentally deleted

635
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,300
antibodies it's just questioning it on
the specifics if you are right

636
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,168
seeing if it's usually registered to
extension

637
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:16,460
one two three

638
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,679
on the pbx

639
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,480
if you don't call it on one of the three
of you send a day

640
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,929
and invites message which doesn't
include step extension

641
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:33,090
that we've been trained talks new for a
four or some other message

642
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,840
but the problem is that

643
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,120
samples with experience when an
extension

644
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,209
just reading going at specific extension
it's not even that

645
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,659
security precautions really about

646
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:50,120
anyone any extension is quite a problem
but arnold is that

647
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,110
a lot of software based

648
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,149
set for weeks

649
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,820
do with this

650
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,120
uh...

651
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,268
span of apartheid were basic forms

652
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:05,740
abt this behavior but some do

653
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,700
so if you're doing these kind of scarce

654
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,809
you might end up

655
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:11,610
uh... calling at all

656
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:15,289
provider and you might end up with lots
of complaints

657
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:16,620
don't do it

658
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:21,479
uh... in the case of the pbx the
behavior somewhat different

659
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,640
at bb excluding

660
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,720
tried to

661
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,830
findpage de extension exists on the nice
work

662
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,949
if that's going into sunday not
technically quality

663
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,409
sometimes

664
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:36,239
not necessarily the case is that there
are many times right

665
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:40,290
it asked for pretentious for vindication

666
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,220
however into texas

667
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,870
extension does not exist and if it
matches for safety and uh...

668
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,780
with certain

669
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,049
patterns if it looks like a phone number

670
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:53,940
it's might strike to did

671
00:31:53,940 --> 00:32:00,120
and it's my tried to or dad phone number
wronged in normal phone system

672
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,489
which might give you reform quotes

673
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,250
and that's what's

674
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,409
someone's rights to do but more than
someone

675
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:12,690
uh... quite a few minutes seem to be
trying to do this

676
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:15,560
one guy actually uh...

677
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,480
wrote the paper dot there

678
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,520
one particular experiment which was on
the

679
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,090
gemini provide that

680
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:27,678
lots of people who were getting each the
squares funny-looking looks

681
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,780
in various cd-r in there

682
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,389
quantic or cohen reports

683
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:35,540
so this time decided to investigate

684
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,850
uses the shipments vij

685
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:42,840
that they were sending it's not accept
the aristide complained but that sees

686
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,929
that it still works

687
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,990
um... who was faking user-agent of
course

688
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,149
tenant everyone forgets exciting

689
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:50,918
well known

690
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:52,929
support for

691
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,390
but this something someone was extreme

692
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:58,080
searching for votes and

693
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,928
uh... trying to uh... finds

694
00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:03,770
waste of getting free fall most

695
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,889
so after reading this

696
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:08,630
this paper which was talking about what

697
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,430
at justice dot over here

698
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,519
i decided to write some basic very basic
quote

699
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,460
f_h_p_ d_x_

700
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,710
uh...

701
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,950
just a few lines of code

702
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,640
uh... and i don't think it went on

703
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,290
sold i put it on the internet and
started looking for database whatever i

704
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:30,250
was going to get paid

705
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,840
it's been a textile

706
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,350
you can look at the

707
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,899
accord

708
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,429
configuration is still part of the cold
but right

709
00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:42,430
be shifting back to an advisory group

710
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,750
uh... the first extension doesn't have
any password

711
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,610
it's some article

712
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:52,179
uh... second extension response we're
gonna wonder except there's extension

713
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:52,919
www

714
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:59,919
and so on

715
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,419
yang you numbers hollow

716
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,230
it works for tax cuts with an army

717
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:12,679
so horrible

718
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:15,849
on the first case we don't have any
prosperous alot

719
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:17,969
just gives you an awfully

720
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:19,259
and

721
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:20,589
so prevalent

722
00:34:20,589 --> 00:34:27,589
thinks it's registered to really pbx

723
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:39,659
second place

724
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:44,889
i'd give it their own prospered

725
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:48,849
so did you learn for for awhile
contingent quiet

726
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:51,379
um...

727
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:54,889
some people notes that

728
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:55,700
the bad

729
00:34:55,699 --> 00:35:02,700
because of that buster keaton with
password

730
00:35:05,569 --> 00:35:08,808
which i did

731
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:10,839
it's registers

732
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:12,769
and finally

733
00:35:12,769 --> 00:35:16,598
i gave it uh... non-existent extension

734
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:18,579
and it's replaced with a four oh four

735
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:25,579
with us here

736
00:35:34,669 --> 00:35:36,069
so that i

737
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:41,879
obviously wanted to make sure that it
works with but recently she's

738
00:35:41,879 --> 00:35:44,749
i don't have any of the other two words
which are not

739
00:35:44,749 --> 00:35:47,368
released and that there are some

740
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:48,899
two weeks

741
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:53,069
uh... which aren't being used by the
underground

742
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:56,349
cost them two weeks for scanning

743
00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:03,349
so i put make sure that the president's
appreciates

744
00:36:04,459 --> 00:36:05,558
the sip

745
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:08,059
that the extension and you may reach you

746
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:11,709
technique is implemented an arms dealer

747
00:36:11,709 --> 00:36:13,339
so what it does is

748
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:14,719
it's

749
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:17,339
uh... checks

750
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:22,859
and uh... an extension of lives

751
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:24,719
it shows that its

752
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:27,389
it exists on the pbx or not

753
00:36:27,389 --> 00:36:32,079
and then finally said as be correct
which dusty

754
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,119
using proved fortuitous

755
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:42,489
on that works

756
00:36:42,489 --> 00:36:43,849
okay so i put this

757
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:45,379
this on the internet

758
00:36:45,379 --> 00:36:49,229
and started getting adventures such as
getting some

759
00:36:49,229 --> 00:36:50,959
interesting messages

760
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,348
i needed to do a lot of things very

761
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:57,219
in my data because uh... uh...

762
00:36:57,219 --> 00:37:02,189
some people were standing because the
war which interests and that's the which

763
00:37:02,189 --> 00:37:03,638
generates a lot of

764
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:07,149
traffic

765
00:37:07,149 --> 00:37:10,109
but once i got to prevent vote of the
way

766
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,439
assassin noticing

767
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:16,859
one of the first messages that i've
served notice and was this message

768
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,640
an invite

769
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,200
uh... destined to uh...

770
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,259
itself america number

771
00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:28,309
and premixed will come from mailed your
solutions

772
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:32,349
i didn't know about this company before

773
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:33,979
uh...

774
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:36,049
and more messages

775
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,859
different numbers

776
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:39,409
trying to get uh...

777
00:37:39,409 --> 00:37:43,809
some some forms during the baby's trying
to get that line

778
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:46,070
tramped through their cause uh...

779
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:48,039
you'll notice that

780
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:50,780
they start changing the prefix

781
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:55,059
so that they had zero zero for example
as an adult of p_b_s_'s

782
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:58,729
you just that deal to get an outside
nine

783
00:37:58,729 --> 00:38:00,078
so it should not

784
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,249
who are these misha solutions and they
seem to be

785
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:05,468
sometimes what

786
00:38:05,469 --> 00:38:08,279
who are interested in voice over at the
security guard

787
00:38:08,279 --> 00:38:10,429
uh...

788
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:17,429
and who are doing some testing critical
support over at the bottom

789
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:20,009
they have a complains

790
00:38:20,009 --> 00:38:22,869
and there are actually saying hey
there's someone who is

791
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:25,549
so i think the use of agents and the
year

792
00:38:25,549 --> 00:38:28,049
the colony b

793
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:32,809
at the corner and the has made it so you
should see it's not us

794
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:34,499
and sent them an email last week

795
00:38:34,499 --> 00:38:35,729
to see what they say

796
00:38:35,729 --> 00:38:38,249
including a and others like

797
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,479
didn't have anything from them

798
00:38:40,479 --> 00:38:42,259
uh...

799
00:38:42,259 --> 00:38:49,259
isn't there some that someone is
exporting data trim company

800
00:38:50,979 --> 00:38:54,950
what us this message i started getting
this message

801
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:57,368
between one like this is very similar

802
00:38:57,369 --> 00:39:01,730
to the same message that that that was
describing that's bigger about cops

803
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:04,649
the paper that i described before

804
00:39:04,649 --> 00:39:06,979
i think this was not one month later

805
00:39:06,979 --> 00:39:08,368
so with these guys

806
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:11,770
which this coming weekend and it didn't
really change their

807
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,169
software unlike

808
00:39:13,169 --> 00:39:14,279
electing

809
00:39:14,279 --> 00:39:16,629
uh...

810
00:39:16,629 --> 00:39:21,319
even after i think there was a
reasonable doubt

811
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:26,589
and they started changing the prefix
elsewhere

812
00:39:26,589 --> 00:39:30,910
with things you know stand working nine
zero one one so the

813
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,440
they try to undo married

814
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,640
the prefix arts and lots of invites
messages

815
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,489
check to get them outside

816
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:43,489
so what's the purpose behind as well
obviously does desperate for divorced

817
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:44,390
uh...

818
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:48,569
invoice will break the fraud

819
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:50,369
form front has been done

820
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:55,159
for quite a while you have the phone
preach and so on what's up mines stores

821
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,229
some of them in the movies

822
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:59,269
uh...

823
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:03,288
mobile home was supposed to cost money
battling for you

824
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:04,759
quote a relation

825
00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:06,619
cost a lot of money

826
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:09,029
so while scheme

827
00:40:09,029 --> 00:40:10,569
seems to be

828
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:13,889
uh... side agreements try to find some

829
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:18,129
pbx systems you don't be prosperous or
excuse all

830
00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:20,308
trekking sindhu there

831
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:21,910
uh... phone calls

832
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,279
uh... try to find a way through their
phone books

833
00:40:25,279 --> 00:40:27,730
on what they do is the the woods

834
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:32,049
configure their pbx test that's ever

835
00:40:32,049 --> 00:40:37,299
uh... to use these different reach bunny
rabbit

836
00:40:37,299 --> 00:40:40,189
pbx is on the internet

837
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:41,149
and

838
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:43,379
d_-day with said

839
00:40:43,379 --> 00:40:45,859
access to the asterisk said that

840
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:50,359
tutors party still point providers
fortifying there said uh... these

841
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:53,328
services cheaper of course

842
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:56,929
and there were some people who work
what's doing this previously so it's not

843
00:40:56,929 --> 00:40:57,679
just

844
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:59,139
my idea

845
00:40:59,139 --> 00:41:00,329
uh...

846
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:01,709
there's a lot

847
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,538
of guys who are not quote or

848
00:41:04,539 --> 00:41:07,699
their just keeping good or were
relatively low

849
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:08,550
uh... right

850
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,599
there though

851
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,559
million dollars of what's this

852
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:15,130
not only on the news but also from

853
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,319
talking to be good

854
00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:18,929
one particular bank

855
00:41:18,929 --> 00:41:20,989
was claiming that they lost

856
00:41:20,989 --> 00:41:22,979
a lot of money

857
00:41:22,979 --> 00:41:26,308
and because of for fraud because of
uh... primero b

858
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:29,019
ups on the internet

859
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:32,459
the program is that sometimes you have
to put your pbx on the internet to

860
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,929
communicate that news it's easier

861
00:41:34,929 --> 00:41:36,749
well it's not necessary

862
00:41:36,749 --> 00:41:38,598
an inspector to pt

863
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:40,230
put it behind the ppm

864
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:43,239
or something like that of course

865
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:43,970
uh...

866
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,779
apart from that

867
00:41:45,779 --> 00:41:48,609
you might have premium number front

868
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:49,720
uh... which

869
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,930
continues in the two words

870
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,899
for selecting

871
00:41:53,899 --> 00:41:56,000
and denial of service

872
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,109
might be a huge problem

873
00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:01,960
uh... in the case of their close and
therefore accept it

874
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,709
it means that

875
00:42:03,709 --> 00:42:06,589
although the all the employees can go to
home

876
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:08,729
the pbx doesn't work anymore

877
00:42:08,729 --> 00:42:12,299
so if you have to call center triangles
to expose your

878
00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:15,659
pbx on the internet at least

879
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:16,999
different stuff

880
00:42:16,999 --> 00:42:18,609
uh...

881
00:42:18,609 --> 00:42:21,549
i've noticed that for example microsoft

882
00:42:21,549 --> 00:42:23,129
their solution

883
00:42:23,129 --> 00:42:24,569
at which supports it

884
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:27,629
all pretty unless

885
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:31,409
uses the windows pretentious so

886
00:42:31,409 --> 00:42:35,149
when you got to do when you do what
indication if you do a good for set that

887
00:42:35,149 --> 00:42:37,130
you might have had a post one seat

888
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,520
so you cannot vote

889
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,530
hold

890
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:42,839
active directory domain digest

891
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,129
i never actually tried this

892
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:48,578
youth

893
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:51,490
so we are for for the stock car into the
sky

894
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:54,399
copycats officious to support my

895
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,219
statistics scanning

896
00:42:58,219 --> 00:42:59,159
first

897
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:03,709
din it's is and you option scans the
first x_ number of

898
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:04,848
type the address is

899
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:06,309
import tax

900
00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:07,520
it's very handy

901
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,269
because

902
00:43:09,269 --> 00:43:13,328
sometimes you don't want to thank all
the advantages

903
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:15,909
anti-bill don't explode this

904
00:43:15,909 --> 00:43:17,309
develop was

905
00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:19,839
handy that and i didn't have my

906
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:21,369
to bear on

907

to delight capture walk across

921
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:10,159

uh...

925
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:21,879
i mean i'm going to read that featured
you know i i don't have

926
00:44:21,879 --> 00:44:24,830
or nine seven features breast implants

927
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,509
uh... opening

928
00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:30,270
these are curious to see was a lawyer i
needs by media a need to start

929
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:33,809
listening to n_p_r_ at these three men
the media

930
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:37,409
stocks according to packwood and make it
make you a bit of his list of all the

931
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:42,109
numbers that are being trend of their
current right now but i can't attended

932
00:44:42,109 --> 00:44:43,729
uh... mildest

933
00:44:43,729 --> 00:44:47,288
south american wants but you don't
really needs to tell me the phone call

934
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:49,180
in the sense that you don't meet

935
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,969
will be used

936
00:44:50,969 --> 00:44:53,759
as estimate you don't need to be that
the other hand

937
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:54,849
because

938
00:44:54,849 --> 00:44:58,089
once you start getting that you don't
normally be

939
00:44:58,089 --> 00:44:58,990
over the phone

940
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:01,979
start sending enacted yet to be st

941
00:45:01,979 --> 00:45:04,118
and yet that that would know

942
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:05,270
that came in half

943
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:08,369
three phone calls

944
00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:10,400
then it would to decide

945
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,239
on its own number

946
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:13,939
track races but

947
00:45:13,939 --> 00:45:15,098
how did that

948
00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:18,219
ivan and there are also when you're
doing those jobs that he wouldn't be fun

949
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:21,259
products and all that was probably
thinks the main for

950
00:45:21,259 --> 00:45:22,639
people to submit

951
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:24,109
what they find

952
00:45:24,109 --> 00:45:27,808
i mean i want to have it at all it is
the difficult more the nub you know more

953
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:31,059
than a million ideas as of the country

954
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:33,069
it's it's quite pleased to have your own

955
00:45:33,069 --> 00:45:35,200
combined altogether the senate

956
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:35,970
hong

957
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:39,509
did you say something about the digest
leakage thing i mean not how it works

958
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:45,219
but maybe how it's useful what would it
be used for using exploited ok okay

959
00:45:45,219 --> 00:45:47,880
so that they just need to check on their
ability

960
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,369
uh...

961
00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:50,739
what it does is

962
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:55,069
you have it's like sunset endpoints
against his old support

963
00:45:55,069 --> 00:45:56,169
uh...

964
00:45:56,169 --> 00:45:58,388
yuko recipe for

965
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:01,459
sometimes you have to guess what
expansionist dot

966
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:05,178
that's not necessarily a problematic
it's a targeted etc etc

967
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,239
if you put a sip phone

968
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:10,610
it concepts and analysis except the
phone for

969
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:14,649
maybe you have to put them into
sportsman or something

970
00:46:14,649 --> 00:46:18,449
went beyond sets doesn't here and i
think something and up

971
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:19,859
from bantam

972
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:21,589
was the handoff

973
00:46:21,589 --> 00:46:23,749
they sent you wrap

974
00:46:23,749 --> 00:46:26,959
and the challenge that bought it's out
of hate you not authorize to send me a

975
00:46:26,959 --> 00:46:30,899
bike if you are your possessions

976
00:46:30,899 --> 00:46:34,868
doesn't interest force i think and we're
not trying to protect that which is

977
00:46:34,869 --> 00:46:37,209
quite possible

978
00:46:37,209 --> 00:46:39,259
it's just that just

979
00:46:39,259 --> 00:46:44,549
authentication sort stepped into
inventions indication it's and it's like

980
00:46:44,549 --> 00:46:46,089
treatments and are

981
00:46:46,089 --> 00:46:48,409
extent the five and it's quite fast

982
00:46:48,409 --> 00:46:50,599
to before such

983
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:53,319
treasures

984
00:46:53,319 --> 00:46:58,359
those funds via overwork dialer again
suspects accused of the cfo

985
00:46:58,359 --> 00:46:59,880
uh... osco books

986
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,359
so-and-so you rewriting the surpluses
nothing

987
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:06,149
so you're putting in more fun features

988
00:47:06,149 --> 00:47:08,499
uh... more progress

989
00:47:08,499 --> 00:47:09,540
so

990
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,479
apply it to

991
00:47:11,479 --> 00:47:14,198
and which is already part of flight back

992
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:19,299
and being convened it's unlikely might
open-source passive smoke

993
00:47:19,299 --> 00:47:24,140
uh... i hope the public siskel that
because siskel on the other ones using

994
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:24,930
fiscal

995
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:26,979
at least in their internet

996
00:47:26,979 --> 00:47:30,739
uh... but so that the structures

997
00:47:30,739 --> 00:47:32,780
apart from the propose

998
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:33,730
uh...

999
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,559
i'd probably the best thing for

1000
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,999
these buddies similar to what swiss all
in the skies

1001
00:47:40,999 --> 00:47:43,430
i'd be exploring that they are more soul

1002
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,578
employer invite stuff

1003
00:47:45,579 --> 00:47:49,579
but i have to be the the uh...

1004
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:51,090
title of ireland

1005
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:52,849
includes dozens of vicious

1006
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:56,089
cause a problem with starting your own
resorts to women's

1007
00:47:56,089 --> 00:47:59,828
uh... everyone uses threats of people
that ended that acts

1008
00:47:59,829 --> 00:48:01,149
and

1009
00:48:01,149 --> 00:48:02,160
fire dept

1010
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,229
quite a few moments do you do

1011
00:48:04,229 --> 00:48:06,649
as people are being quite pretty

1012
00:48:06,649 --> 00:48:07,839
sold it

1013
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,720
anti-tank include something which is not
easy

1014
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,538
i want to make sure that it's

1015
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:15,369
not as easy to use

1016
00:48:15,369 --> 00:48:17,929
it's not just plug and play in

1017
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:21,709
that's officious tends to be quite
consistent

1018
00:48:21,709 --> 00:48:23,799
but you're getting elected smells

1019
00:48:23,799 --> 00:48:25,099
yeah from time to time

1020
00:48:25,099 --> 00:48:27,149
but no not that much

1021
00:48:27,149 --> 00:48:30,209
but whenever i do an update

1022
00:48:30,209 --> 00:48:34,959
admittedly turks easy to set your own
usery's man

1023
00:48:34,959 --> 00:48:36,519
picked up by that

1024
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:39,049
but there's that independent labs the
fingerprint
