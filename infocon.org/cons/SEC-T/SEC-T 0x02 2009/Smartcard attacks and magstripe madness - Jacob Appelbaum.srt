the internet is also members already
another great be so what we want to

28
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,940
explore is

29
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,570
the holocaust

30
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,259
cracking an information security

31
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,710
strange you do this fact

32
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,140

38
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,850
uh...

39
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,330
so basically

40
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,679
column just this effect information
security work

41
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:57,060
insecurity in general

42
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,920
but has been our our theme when we
called him in a difficult the papers

43
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,400
this year

44
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,780

45
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,620
carlos' missions

46
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,819
and also we invited a few speakers that
we wanted to see

47
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:15,238
and uh... all this because the rewards
the cd or this year actually accepted

48
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,189
our proposal speaks of the very very
happy about this year's

49
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:21,198
and speaker lineup

50
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,069
he's basically we wanted to break a
conference

51
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:27,089
but we want to go to some don't have to
go to

00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:30,228
the u_s_ help canada or someplace

53
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:35,189
uh... redgrave much that that's been the

58
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,009
students in general tinkers can meet
some common ground to charities

59
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:53,738
at last year we had long protect

yes the speeches for fantastic but
there's not enough area to mingle run

62
00:02:59,589 --> 00:03:04,379
so this year's creative least another
room it's uh... down the hall

63
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,959
hate section called uranus

so we're talking about going to be
harder this year

164
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:26,489
uh... so the first level has been
published for two weeks analyze tracked

165
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:27,820
the first level yet

166
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,279
as a re-used published half of the
solution

167
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,809
uh...

168
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:33,839
and

169
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,029
bright colors three stages sale this
island's

170
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:39,039
someone who's really really quick

171
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,299
and cracking them

172
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:42,099
than me who published a four

173
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,020
uh... hundred-thousand loud and history

174
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,790
and embrace their work on the challenges
uh...

175
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,759
if you like to

176
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,900
as soon as the first level is cracked
will publish the second one

177
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,439
uh...

178
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,880
so that's a and acted

179
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,050
apart from the speakers will have

180
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,189
the challenge for you guys work on

181
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,330
uh... and we will also have been antenna
build off

182
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,770
uh... it will be into smaller of that

183
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,810
uh... md and basically you'll get uh...
uh...

184
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,270
untethered connector

185
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,860
and you should build the best possible
intend that we'll give you a maximum

186
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,100
gain

187
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,240
uh... for the fight to get our spot

188
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,080

190
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,010
uh... let's just look like he does but

191
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,630
estimates false about that on

192
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,900
adhoc self-destruct europe

193
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,090
cheater assisted

194
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:46,939
the conference buck of this afternoon at
will to head off and

195
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:50,010

00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,540
economic matters is the plan to be there

00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,120
weber samoan about that t_v_ ppc your
batch

200
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,170
and that

201
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,419
that will have to know that uh... wonder
what site

202
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:11,410
barris

203
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,600
uh... a small menu of what you can

if you want like to have dinner with us

anesthetic

210
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,750
okay let's uh...

211
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,010
that's a pretty much

212
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,780
uh... from us

213
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,520
organizers

214
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,130
uh... and it without further ado

215
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:51,120
uh... you can't have used for speaker

216
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,450
you know

217
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,080
from

218
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:01,080
please eula liberals for mister
dicamillo first began

219
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,020
i have thank you very much for having
her i've always wanted to come to sweden

220
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,400
so it's quite an honor to be invited

221
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,220
org

222
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:22,220
person casual

223
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:14,790
i forgot something ste

224
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,069
so

225
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,839
this is kind of a little bit of a crazy
talk

226
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:22,850
because the people who invited me uh...

227
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,350
sort of suggested that i didn't want out
and they said that have about sixty

228
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,920
minutes

229
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,110
but on the schedule and i found that
actually it's to talks that would

230
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,150
comprise about four hours of material in
six minutes

231
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,680
i thought about different ways to
present this the first where was the

232
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,520
alternate his life's work a dispute both
topics at the same time

233
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,399
but i thought that that might be a
little bit about

234
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,450
sir and to do in two parts

235
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,650
the first part of an attorney breezed
through because i feel like it's not us

236
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,750
maybe not as interesting

237
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,310
uh...

238
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,140
but it might actually applied more

239
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,370
and the second part by actually wrote

240
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,200
in the last four hours or something

241
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,510
uh... so it's actually really excited to
meet with and spending all my time

242
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,470
working on departing intercept

243
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,689
also there's extensive uh... press
coverage and documentation to millions

244
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:15,089
of that talk so mostly i want to present
that as a as a way to so disgusting

245
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,360
not necessarily to go over all of the
things that previously talked about and

246
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,639
the next six days

247
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:24,129
is mostly about uh... munster cologne
for a balanced lives and other

248
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:26,129
interesting people that worked on

249
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:30,260
pregnant rats and uh... basically about
like the physics behind it and also

250
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,550
uh... actually practically use that

251
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,540
without further ado represent you act
one

252
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,150
smart parking meters

253
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:42,260
uh... so basically uh... joe grand kris
janowski iraq

254
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,819
still being an amazing uh... electrical
engineer

255
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,210
have records and renting studio

256
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,309
he uh... wasn't sent to spill

257
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:50,439
as the rock

258
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,910
uh... i'm from these places and
associated with these people

259
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,010
their surveillance bridge actor states
and sent to spirits like a cast computer

260
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,209
club test for

261
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:01,180
basically

262
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,170
spree big it's a nonprofit with over a
hundred members were cash-flow positive

263
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,149
and we do stuff like this research

264
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:10,949
not really particularly for corporate
interests or academic interest but

265
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:13,979
because we're actually distinction and
packing the planet

266
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,390
uh... apart on a couple other notable
things

267
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,689
most recently tickled that attacks on
the road certificate authority

268
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:22,170
medburn about that

269
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:26,010
uh... i'm also interested in lok looking
at the pool system so

270
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,970
uh... kris janowski also worked

271
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,300
uh...

272
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,689
physically all of this will combine also
says is done by him into the is

273
00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:36,540
pretty much the most brilliant star trek
occur on the planet

274
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,540
he's attacks every star card system
that's ever been designed and i think is

275
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,860
going broke and everything

276
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,230
that expecting to something intact

277
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:49,640
but i know that he is acting like becky
didn't operate

278
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,819
i personally really dislike for
commuters about yes

279
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,680
my motivation was not really altruistic

280
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,199
i don't know the call

281
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,390
to be fit and motorcycle

282
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,850
uh... but

283
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,880
and really dislike the fact that we
spend millions and millions of dollars

284
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,970
in parking meter enforcer and

285
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,440
i found that it was a little bit
distasteful especially in the united

286
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,339
states we have few social stratification
issues where we have for homeless people

287
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:19,579
on the street and in less than thirty
five million dollars on the parking

288
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:21,599
meters every every five feet

289
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,910
it seems like a kind of opulent someone
amidst poverty especially census data i

290
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,519
can really get behind and so i wanted to
sort of

291
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:29,679
uh... shame

292
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,780
the city

293
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,040
offenses bill

294
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,219
but it wasn't just the streets and studs
kind of wanted to

295
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,390
against who cool in the idea if you will
using electronic devices

296
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:42,360
uh... for parking enforcement i sort of
feel like

297
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,640
people trust machines a great deal known
as part of the reason discover too

298
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,499
seriously

299
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:47,420
people really

300
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,389
really trust machines for almost every
aspect of their life so what i want to

301
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:52,510
do is bring some doubt into that trust

302
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,600
i wanted to say

303
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,319
you know do you have a system that it's
true that said that your parking meter

304
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:01,019
had expired but maybe that system isn't
perfect and if we can chip away at that

305
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:04,219
assumption to me the people can start to
protest things that are centrally and

306
00:16:04,219 --> 00:16:05,210
justin

307
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,190
insulators

308
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,769
i mean i i knew that there are some good
reasons for having her commuter

309
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:09,710
enforcement

310
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,210
but in general i

311
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,290
accustomed so annoyed by the actual cost
of it but i don't care about the could

312
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,520
benefit

313
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,540
uh... so

314
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,569
we basically wanted to

315
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:22,150
diving deep to this and we look at a lot
of different parking meter

316
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,730
basically all the different systems you
could think of it

317
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,890
and documented some online you can buy
them on ebay

318
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,120
and there's a lot of money and parking
meters so they actually mystery itself

319
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,440
is a multi-billion dollar industry and
their tons of different types of attacks

320
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,490
that you can do you could do against
these pieces of hardware and against the

321
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,060
software systems and

322
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,699
the the interconnect between all sorts
of different of networks that you

323
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,140
regularly you sometime cell phone
networks others otherwise of smart card

324
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,709
network or credit card networks

325
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:52,319
and so there's all sorts of different
intersections and it's definitely a

326
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:56,868
multi-disciplinary area for attacking to
one of focus on breaking one system

327
00:16:56,869 --> 00:16:59,679
you're gonna need to know about couple
of different types of

328
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:01,410
but systems or networks or

329
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,689
uh... computing devices

330
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,880
uh... we basically wanted to

331
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,190
look at it from uh... high-level
perspective looking at all the different

332
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,530
systems that are around

333
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,129
and we also want it actually perform a
case study

334
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,270
and since joanna both live in san
francisco we took that placed a task

335
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,459
has a specific

336
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:21,740
as a specific attack

337
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,230
uh... but you could probably do the same
thing in your city

338
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:29,400
i didn't include one of the newest
slides uh... in this talk

339
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,580
protect the public could sure later

340
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:36,220
but essentially uh... silence is still
after we depart taka black hat

341
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,380
uh... started fielding some other
parking meters of other designs

342
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,950
uh... the use of was able to attend for
kind of interesting

343
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:47,179
uh... waited to solve gaming this record
system

344
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:49,950
uh... of it and

345
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,870
we basically have to all of these
different features that we walked there

346
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:56,520
are a large so then you can make sure
that you know that when you paid it

347
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,789
you have an entry there so that they
contract to seek respect what

348
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:03,309
uh... and of course you have roles
separation which is kind of useful so

349
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:06,450
that if the person that collects all
alone can't collect the money they have

350
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,360
a very different incentive for ensuring
protestant happening

351
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,169
if the person that collects the money is
the first neglects dialogue to make

352
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,060
distinctions and that they have some
sort of digital proof

353
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,149
at the haven't sold from system

354
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,600
uh... so it's very interesting because
some of the systems actually have a

355
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,459
serial bus on the outside of the or
incorrect

356
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,360
where you can download the audit log

357
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,610
so or to change it perks tamper with it

358
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,678
uh... for example in san francisco

359
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,159
we we had

360
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:33,190
mechanical meters and we can

361
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,549
will need to be made in heaven meters as
a person with an approach either

362
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:40,359
but will further deadline we got cars
and parking meters for mechanical

363
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:44,019
and to those parking meters um... were
pretty good for quite some time but we

364
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:47,080
had some froder season seven cisco
apparently something like three million

365
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,780
dollars in changeover some number of
years

366
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,670
it seems like the solution according to
the city was that we should implement

367
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,340
some sort of role separation electronic

368
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,270
tracking all sorts of

369
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,379
you know fancy buzzwords and here was
that if we were to do that would become

370
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,620
so complicated insist care

371
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,050
that no would be able to due process of
anymore

372
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,418
and of course

373
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:11,540
that's probably not the case if you work
with electronic systems but for people

374
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,480
who don't know anything about technology
that somebody great idea and we should

375
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,960
spend millions of dollars on and so they
did

376
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,230
uh... indicates of some cities they're
actually entirely electronic

377
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,659
services for the hybrid

378
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:23,389
so

379
00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:25,510
it's actually

380
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:29,919
it's actually either coins or smart card
and in some areas its credit cards

381
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,190
an effort to take it

382
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:35,280
and debating accidents and field trials
previously i just hadn't actually seen

383
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,330
the other field trials as possible they
were there before a blockhead talk at

384
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,168
any embedded computer has a series of

385
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:43,919
of

386
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,470
things that you're going to have to
other

387
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,010
so for example if you have so he takes
credit cards

388
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:51,450
you have the ability to verify the
credit card is valid doesn't known

389
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,870
algorithms of credit card lady

390
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:57,110
uh... but it doesn't actually tell you
if it is so like if the church is

391
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,899
actually something you can authorize
because just because a card isabelle

392
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,030
glasser credit doesn't necessarily mean

393
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,600
that there's actually anybody in the
account uh... one of the church in

394
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,139
toronto i've heard about

395
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,760
is that people back in mid life i guess
when they were generating credit cards

396
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,840
and just really fun to see if they got
it correct

397
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,949
uh... they would actually go to parking
meters which did bachelor cation of

398
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,710
processes

399
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,350
you know the end of the day they would
run a bunch of credit cards

400
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,929
uh... they would be able to use my
picard and without actually defrauding

401
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,200
ever using the ticket

402
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,170
um... they could tell if the machine
would think that it was valid so they're

403
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:34,240
actually using third-party
implementation but i don't know

404
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,990
uh... as a verification process for
fraud which i think that players

405
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,640
uh... and let them in the uh... at the
end of the night and of course that

406
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,510
would be like

407
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,629
ineptitude of it and then it would
probably feel the company just bought

408
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,090
the part of the hair

409
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,409
it's like uh... a little credit for
generators now particularly interesting

410
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,970
to kind of thing

411
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,410
come as you can see here this woman

412
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,850
actually has a uh... serial port

413
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:02,040
and there's a computer uh... that's
attached to the super meter

414
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:09,040
yeah all and

415
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,860
quite slow in in this particular uh...
leader implementations event is billed

416
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,439
as the g_a_t_t_

417
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,220
uh... or commuter

418
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,330
it's actually

419
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:24,149
this the courts all itself

420
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:28,450
they wanted to do well separation but
they only want to have one key right

421
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:33,490
you can plug into the serial port
without opening

422
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,450
by design

423
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,539
because they didn't want the people
don't open the meter

424
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,320
to be the ones using the serial port

425
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,639
uh...

426
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,580
interesting read

427
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,379
that's one hundred and it is interesting
because what they were trying to protect

428
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,750
against is very obvious air raid they
were trying to pretend that technology

429
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,000
sold all their problems and technology
doesn't solve any of your problem

430
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,310
threats like the famous quote from jimmy
stansky about regular expressions so you

431
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:02,720
have a problem so use regular
expressions may have to problems

432
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,440
creates a

433
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,610
i mean i think it's pretty much the same
thing here

434
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:09,490
uh... there's another leary's things
about this i mean these before commuters

435
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,020
are just like

436
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,279
incredible i mean if you really want it

437
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,250
certified and i'll cut your teeth on
breaking something dislike by parking

438
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,760
meters on the internet

439
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,169
and if you can get a full parking meter
system which probably is a little bit of

440
00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:25,279
work uh... you would have the ability to
access

441
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,059
these different administrator interfaces
and services for the multi states needed

442
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:29,250
a judgment

443
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,409
on the street i was uh... having lunch
at uh...

444
00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:34,270
some some company's headquarters

445
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,610
and uh...

446
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:39,149
basically i left and when walking down
the street i saw this huge like more

447
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,670
peace peace meters that have

448
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:44,120
solar panel on top of my head like a
displaying undertaken and the credit

449
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,428
card and took instead

450
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:49,760
i looked at and i just kind of like
matched to keep at it couple times

451
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,809
cycle and what happens if you do that

452
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:57,100
and what happened was that an
administrator many puppet

453
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,459
so some of these uh... interfaces are
even easier select under other you can

454
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,570
also file

455
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,399
holding the button and then letting go
of another button

456
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:07,899
and it will pop up a menu that will
allow you to print like debugging

457
00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:09,789
information about the nurse and

458
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:13,389
i posted this online along with some
photographs of the acceptance capability

459
00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:16,669
intruder menu for these types of meters
and someone in chicago told me that

460
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,549
deployed actual meters

461
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:19,780
using uh...

462
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,620
using uh... that firmware from that
vendor or for more much like it

463
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,839
uh... even in the field they don't have
a password

464
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:28,480
and you could like veteran bike
administrative change

465
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,510
it's actually kind of interesting thing
and it is on the one hand it

466
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,510
doesn't need to be secret information in
fact i kinda like the idea that you as a

467
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,889
citizen kinhdoanh all of the art of logs

468
00:23:37,889 --> 00:23:41,229
and then you can have a printed
verification and you can say

469
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,200
what's going on here

470
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,910
you know i see that this is different
than what you guys are part of

471
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,400
so i think i think that's kind of like
uh... kind of probably like a pipe dream

472
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,190
that anyone would ever do that but

473
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:53,210
uh... i mean adding a password
protection feature to that probably

474
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:56,700
isn't that important except that in the
same menu it allows you to activate

475
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,419
infrared sensor

476
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:02,110
uh... and it's interesting because the
inference answers actually sunk into the

477
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:02,909
meter

478
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,010
and so it would

479
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,870
maybe be possible to built like an
opulent trickery like where you could

480
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:12,309
uh... sticky into the device and then
the the percolator made will come up and

481
00:24:12,309 --> 00:24:13,800
then use the admission a feature

482
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,770
and you have a small circuit board it
looks a lot like near-infrared and then

483
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,430
actually just records and plays it
through

484
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:24,210
if you want to so like a in a chance to
look for in parenthesis

485
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,990
uh... so i mean it's the all these
different protocols and they all have

486
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:30,250
their weaknesses but i i feel like they
haven't

487
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,260
within the physical design of the meter
shows a people thinking very much about

488
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,870
that because they wouldn't have made
something that was easy to set something

489
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:39,139
into it they had

490
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:43,040
here's uh... let me show you a series of
photographs of different leaders

491
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,379
uh... results in texas uh...

492
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,659
well since the or country at the top

493
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:51,759
uh... this one has what looks like a
smart card and coins lots of hybrid and

494
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:55,359
has a digital display you can see it
'cause someone really didn't like that

495
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:56,830
may be very much

496
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,929
uh... this is the chicago meter so this
is basically the same thing as the

497
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,870
senate as commuters is telling you about

498
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:03,049
and two

499
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:05,850
rethinking it's maybe slightly different

500
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,428
basically for the that some of the
current status there

501
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:11,259
uh... they'll seize all of the left and
then when the records in in parade

502
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,330
displaying terror to scope for some of
those

503
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,629
this three buttons where there's a
credit card there

504
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:22,070
the research without further in the red
angry bonds are up higher coach at the

505
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,419
reading grievance when you call them

506
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,600
if you let go of uh... the robot nothing
happens but if you look at the green

507
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,439
button after all involved down

508
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,600
brings up the administrative many
remains sort of cap the green button and

509
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:39,600
tell you wanna make your selection many
a little ball does the action desired

510
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,249
it was like up up down down left for a
that starts work either

511
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:46,309
there was never going to be here to
inspect

512
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:48,100
basically the same thing

513
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,449
something cooper has this really cool
system

514
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,330
and that is

515
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,539
it's basically three

516
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:55,750
it one

517
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,720
so you can pay sarkar

518
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,590
you can pay with points

519
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:03,709
and as a digital display or you can pay
by phone and i was told by some locals

520
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,700
the way that this works as you pay for
it

521
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,170
and when you're paying by phone you tell
them than your numbers the six zero

522
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:13,260
three nine nine is that the meter number
for the left and then six years six five

523
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,658
one is the one on the right

524
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,049
essentially what you have

525
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:20,190
is analyst at every meal impasse

526
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:23,330
and they know that when they see expired
meter they check that list and if you're

527
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,980
on the list here in okay

528
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,049
so they actually had a separation of
payment system

529
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:31,540
uh... potentially true what that
essentially means

530
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,990
is that you have the ability to gain
these meters by gaining a portly

531
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:38,430
differences that entirely outside
leaders themselves

532
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,180
so they basically said like there's this
if you can break in the first to whisper

533
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,690
using swans are miss marker

534
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:49,110
uh... c_q_ confirmed prick their way
into free parking

535
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:53,240
i wonder how well did secure dot our
auditor patented it seems like probably

536
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,280
not very well disgusting

537
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,870
just by looking at the way that the
actual meters themselves are developed

538
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,570
in israel they have the same

539
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,429
think this is a on meter

540
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,159
uh... it's slightly

541
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:08,880
it slightly different but it's basically
the same as much as you make a duty as a

542
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,919
canadian company

543
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,980
uh... they have a lot of information
online readable

544
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,570
uh... i think they probably

545
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,340
and start about time guys

546
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,620
if you're watching this video

547
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,939
really nothing personal

548
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,550
some people have previously attacked the
systems and actually before we give our

549
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:27,590
blackout talk some people thought we
have to chicago parking meters which we

550
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,649
did not

551
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:32,889
uh... their day just had some like a
strange bunching up somewhere

552
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,030
we

553
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:34,820
through was

554
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,370
probably because they haven't considered

555
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,370
how greedy they want to be even
implemented the system

556
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,219
and it looks like they had some sort of
like overflow because they put in a

557
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,269
number of that number was

558
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:50,010
may be too hard and they hadn't have
like a proper said test

559
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:53,060
uh... so when they raise the rates and
meager started crashing as they can and

560
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,370
do the calculations

561
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,750
for the prices

562
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,640
uh... gradually certain of that but it
seems like that's the case

563
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,440
uh... and also as possible using a
universal remote control

564
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,870
right back here

565
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:07,000
and skipping over the middle but the
universal remote control

566
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,790
with the i mean it's basically

567
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,029
these same people figured out how to
follow his lead in the new york city

568
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:14,970
uh... parking meters with reset you
could cause people to get tickets and

569
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,960
stuff like that because you could cause
me to the crash where you can cause an

570
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,140
eager to deduct change

571
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,100
and no one really actually spit sat down
and had thought about how to do that but

572
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,830
actually figured out the exact bites and
publish it anyway so there's a new

573
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,220
station that went out

574
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,230
and actually acquired a universal remote
control in the circus bugs selling yes

575
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,860
indeed this is possible

576
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,500
so it's not a particularly skilled
attacking blue really understand what

577
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,730
was happening so

578
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:43,850
probably the best research on this
previous was the uninformed journal

579
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,320
article by picard david told me

580
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,158
prefer peter computing works on a
p_d_a_s professor

581
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:50,659
soon good friend of mine is it

582
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:52,030
poorly child actor

583
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,580
here too great article

584
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:58,360
basically if you read that and you read
the slides that joker tonight created

585
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,159
uh... you could probably take that and
you could really do a good analysis on

586
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:06,010
any of our computer system that exists
he he specifically focused on sort value

587
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,929
cards and if you know anyone from
eastern europe that's been

588
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:14,060
working unlike to strikers record you
know that they really broke

589
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:18,020
the systems like to know decade or more
so it's a lot of the stuff is old hat

590
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:21,850
apply to the public new technologies but
a lot of it is actually designed

591
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:23,189
in the eighties and nineties

592
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,620
and it still insistence that it's okay

593
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,080
it's agus uh...

594
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,408
historical lesson

595
00:29:28,409 --> 00:29:31,570
you need to basically focus on things
that people who are redundant and apply

596
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:34,519
them to some of the new system through
some implementation details in the

597
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:36,169
eastern part of its been added

598
00:29:36,169 --> 00:29:39,390
but it's all pretty much the same

599
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:43,690
uh... we want to like also describe the
general process but if you've ever have

600
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,440
to anything you know this process right
leg bone or they can do

601
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,640
well i wonder what these things do
appointments at

602
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,440
well let's look at the hardware let's
see how they actually do things and then

603
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,260
depending on how deep you want to go

604
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,210
you you really can go quite deep with
kristen austin borger quite like you

605
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,399
were able to go

606
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:00,979
into the fall

607
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,130
and of actually having to live and die

608
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,960
analysis where we can book at that for
what

609
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,940
dis is clearly an area of memory

610
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,320
on the card rate you probably don't need
to go that far intact

611
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,919
if i was really just for fun

612
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,140
most of the system so you can you can
pretty much break without having any

613
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,530
idea about hardware

614
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,399
accused really about box

615
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,059
uh... we could also do a little bit
further found if you'd get a chance you

616
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:30,480
can do some former reversing because
uh... basically no parking meter system

617
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,510
actually walks down the chips they're
not tamper resistant in any way

618
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,760
so if you've got a mere aren't you there

619
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,070
you can dump actual suffer from the
meter

620
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,760
and you can server sing and you can
figure out the algorithms that they use

621
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,770
for everything

622
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:42,639
for cover

623
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:43,679
clocks work

624
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,919
to how calculations for the cards are
gone so to get recruiter

625
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,700
that actually happened to get you

626
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,290
you probably want uh... if you get a
park near that has

627
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,760
a smart card interface

628
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,340
and then it also has

629
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,840
uh... essentially

630
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,408
uh... a carpet goes with it and you
don't know how the card works you could

631
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:04,330
dump the firmware from one of the meters
which might be a destructive process to

632
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:04,830
connect

633
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,990
not as good scripts

634
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,930
and then you can try to read and
emulator and software or run there for

635
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:10,790
more

636
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:14,149
uh... because usually the either of
implemented it using like a

637
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:18,340
microcontroller or they've done with as
the basic

638
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,510
generally speaking if they have quick
code that's on the system you can run

639
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,019
that

640
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:26,159
in some way and then you could use that
to actually annually this uh... meter

641
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,129
and then you could try to see what the
smart card doesn't meet our talks to it

642
00:31:29,129 --> 00:31:32,289
and then you get right actually ben
daniela department to try to write a

643
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:35,029
card and a letter for the remaining
uh...

644
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:37,110
i mean if you really have that much time
on your hands that you might consider

645
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,610
going working at one of these companies

646
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:42,090
so seems like they were going to be less
frustrating

647
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,520
and more fulfilling and possibly or
something

648
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:51,520
and they really probably need to help
because or not so that the stuff

649
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,059
we wanted to think of some like crazy
crazy ideas um...

650
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:59,309
or

651
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:04,670
well

652
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:09,040
salary of christoph from united states

653
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,539
answers with plastic

654
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:13,480
uh...

655
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,720
there's all sorts of crazy shit you do
with leaders prayed their computers and

656
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,500
tonight even if this is uh...

657
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,960
rereading what did you take off and say
look for actors building and your

658
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,700
partners

659
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,670
because that's not true to do that but
you would be totally trivial if you find

660
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:30,660
leaders that you think should be radios
or something like that

661
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,820
you could probably use those to u

662
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,800
do it you can do with a new york reach
out and touch somebody

663
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,950
basically

664
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,100
that's a that's kind of

665
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,869
into saying

666
00:32:40,869 --> 00:32:43,609
but with the theoretical had some
theoretical in a way that you need to

667
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:46,009
make a practical that'll be cool if
someone did

668
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:48,640
uh... it's mostly theoretical incentives
like

669
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,900
you could do it but what do you get a
little bit

670
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,190
of the more interesting

671
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:55,090
i had like i said earlier when to focus
on some of the social effects

672
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:59,059
so sitting in your travel orders bobby
the number one attack

673
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:02,250
but i think it's is bad news for people
because

674
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,320
if you've ever gotten a parking ticket
you know that

675
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,418
at least in the united states and
especially sensitive where you can test

676
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:09,340
that is ok

677
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:12,959
usse itin i didn't do this may think
that's nice

678
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,790
it's eighty five dollars

679
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:18,049
and then you say it but i didn't get it
from msn sorry you're not you can

680
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:20,820
actually get to have a trial you don't
get the contestants at eighty five

681
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,730
dollars

682
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,400
and then you can say what i want to pay
that and then they say okay we're gonna

683
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,650
go undercover

684
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:29,610
so you really can't win so if you can
prove

685
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,929
that it's possible for someone to do t
if you take it by making and your

686
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:34,840
out of order

687
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,220
i think we may be able to change it
social dynamic a little bit

688
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,240
in montreal for example i was told that

689
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,360
it's possible to reset the meters by
after central time

690
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,050
and more money

691
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,500
so you can walk by what the role
quarters

692
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,480
and just

693
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,559
four quarters and each of the meters

694
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:54,520
and you've just given everything on this
people on the block a ticket

695
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,080
is they want to stop people from being
able to feed the meters and help people

696
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,500
so they made it so that when you're
trying to help we are trickles into it

697
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,800
well what happened as a result according
to the person the black had told me this

698
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,470
now the city

699
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,438
well actually allow you to contest
tickets

700
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:12,199
because people actually went around
interest but quarters in everything in

701
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:15,359
order to try to undermine the authority
of the electronic system

702
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,788
so they successfully changed the way
that people think about those parking

703
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:18,619
meters

704
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:22,659
uh... using the this security print
uh... basically a security properties of

705
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:25,209
the device themselves

706
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:29,598
and expect back from a it down

707
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,809
so you could also if you read some of
our contention a lot of these places

708
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:37,349
talk about how the smart card is like a
sacrificial lamb of meter

709
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:40,209
but they want to make sure that you can
destroy the main circuitry

710
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:41,210
uh... so

711
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:45,230
you you know basically can kill just the
parked it plugin plugs and i'm not sure

712
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,089
how it's modular looks like it

713
00:34:48,089 --> 00:34:51,788
if you were of course to destroy the the
module in campaigns marker to do what

714
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:54,199
they want to do is make sure that you
could replace like a two dollar are

715
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:57,139
really easily but not like multi hundred
dollar per

716
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:00,179
bird multi hundred your part

717
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:03,459
that's kind of interesting because what
they did it is electrically isolate some

718
00:35:03,459 --> 00:35:06,888
of these components so that if you have
a collection of uh...

719
00:35:06,889 --> 00:35:08,399
uh... voltage

720
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:09,650
than average to like

721
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,719
you know basically

722
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:13,369
uh... jack and twenty three years you
wouldn't be able to destroy the whole

723
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:14,199
thing

724
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:17,739
but sometimes they make mistakes so like
for example i mentioned the serial buses

725
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:20,469
on the outside of the parking meter

726
00:35:20,469 --> 00:35:23,989
that one as far as i can tell is not
electrically isolated in the same words

727
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:25,399
that smart cards

728
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:26,180
so

729
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,719
if you just nowhere on the mir two point
teaser

730
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:31,449
the possible to do that

731
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:34,989
uh... but and that poses an interesting
effect which has been in san francisco

732
00:35:34,989 --> 00:35:37,839
demure system fills close

733
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,839
basically that means that when the meter
uh...

734
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:41,999
isn't working

735
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:43,788
you get a ticket

736
00:35:43,789 --> 00:35:46,939
at circus your part and it's not at work

737
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:49,538
and of course you could potentially
depending on the latest look which is

738
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:50,290
too large

739
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:53,100
mind possible to make allegedly users
credit

740
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,828
or payment system blocked

741
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:56,719
in some way

742
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:57,659
and another

743
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:00,329
couple things and we thought about
lecture

744
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:02,509
not particularly interesting until the
last one

745
00:36:02,509 --> 00:36:05,979
basically just the ability to change
uh...

746
00:36:05,979 --> 00:36:08,928
what commuters thinking or doing in a
smarter way

747
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:11,449
and of course being able to modify the
all along it's kind of an interesting

748
00:36:11,449 --> 00:36:13,150
thing as what happens

749
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,780
if you were able to modify the art of
what was that he come forward and tell

750
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:19,170
the public that someone has entered
things into a lot of love like hello

751
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,589
either uncertainty run amok

752
00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:24,609
told how the entire city about this

753
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:27,899
maybe with

754
00:36:27,899 --> 00:36:31,549
we of course but uh... for those of you
know what's the simpsons with out of the

755
00:36:31,549 --> 00:36:35,369
kind of funny someone came to me there's
just a everyday is sunday sunday sunday

756
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:36,569
uh...

757
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:41,679
uh... schoolchildren doesn't transfer
but

758
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:44,739
uh... both personal as well as the like
the dream

759
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:47,779
innocent journalist will be everybody
hates parking meters and a meter maids

760
00:36:47,779 --> 00:36:51,329
in managing tickets everybody wants to
be able to defraud the meters

761
00:36:51,329 --> 00:36:54,289
but i personally testing people should
read about sickle rates of stockholm as

762
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:57,509
a country into the i'd never been here
before yesterday and i just got done

763
00:36:57,509 --> 00:37:00,379
thirty riding a bike and i didn't you
card anywhere

764
00:37:00,379 --> 00:37:03,808
and i kind of wish that every city was
like that i'd feel like it's really

765
00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:06,929
attitude at that moment society has
essentially abandon

766
00:37:06,929 --> 00:37:08,710
uh... people riding a bicycle

767
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,569
or walking

768
00:37:09,569 --> 00:37:13,239
and we basically always taken strasbourg
radar images remain healthy internal and

769
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:20,239
we spent millions of dollars to deal
with the costs of the those decisions

770
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:24,919
this is basically the same in every
single attack scenario it's not specific

771
00:37:24,919 --> 00:37:27,420
to parking meters

772
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,229
hydrolysis is essentially exactly the
same in every

773
00:37:31,229 --> 00:37:34,509
and every system right you're going to
try to understand how the harbor works

774
00:37:34,509 --> 00:37:36,620
and what the hardware does and then

775
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:42,839
you can sort of start to think lead
engineer to implement it

776
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:46,130
it's totally possible to acquire the
hiring legitimately legally which is

777
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,659
really key set

778
00:37:47,659 --> 00:37:52,069
the reason we talked about it being
globalism and on slide title is because

779
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:53,529
for all intents and purposes

780
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,389
a city doesn't implement the system

781
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:56,270
on its own

782
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:59,530
usually out sources are bisa apart and
then they have some sort of immigration

783
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:02,279
meeting between multiple vendors

784
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:06,839
work you're going to be used by the same
leader on e-bay and once you have that

785
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:07,788
that later

786
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:09,750
you don't have the same base

787
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:13,120
that's on the other systems that at
least with regard to factual hardware

788
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,910
the sock run it might be running
something totally different than what

789
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,670
your personal required a great

790
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,660
but basically you can start to see
whether or not they for example blimp

791
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,049
uses on circuits

792
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,710
or whether or not they have particular
interfaces or

793
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,890
how the electrically isolated from the
outside case because generally they want

794
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:29,350
to

795
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:32,399
maximizing profits baby that meter
companies

796
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:35,499
uh... and they don't worry design
everything every single time though i do

797
00:38:35,499 --> 00:38:38,988
it one time and then they want to sell
it to as many people as we can

798
00:38:38,989 --> 00:38:42,399
so that they can make sure that they
have the greatest surplus in the labor

799
00:38:42,399 --> 00:38:43,380
and it makes sense

800
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,800
uh... but what that means for city is
that they really

801
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,050
need to get these systems properly
because like something designed badly

802
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:53,599
wants and sold two hundred cities does
not mean that it is good

803
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,049
and uh... i mean even though i might
disagree with a lot of the things that

804
00:38:56,049 --> 00:38:57,220
the leadership in smaller

805
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,649
uh... essentially

806
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,319
if it's a bad designers can be a bad
design everywhere

807
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:02,600
and so you

808
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,489
hollywood wanna watch out for that

809
00:39:04,489 --> 00:39:08,569
so this is uh... one of the dog leaders
i had a couple extra copies here but i i

810
00:39:08,569 --> 00:39:10,019
want to go down

811
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:15,678
uh... sandler uh... maybe ten minutes
left before i switched off expert

812
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:17,130
this is an electronic needed

813
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,619
uh... but it also has of course
onslaught

814
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:22,059
and you can actually see sort of badly

815
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:23,209
in this photograph

816
00:39:23,209 --> 00:39:25,019
uh... there's some screws

817
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:32,019
and there is a heavy areas here

818
00:39:42,529 --> 00:39:47,609
the intellectually push against the
screws and screws or making such a way

819
00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:50,279
that they actually push a button on a
circuit court of money

820
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,459
and that's what the serbs were
underneath looks like

821
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:56,549
so pushing up on my dad's life some some
number of

822
00:39:56,549 --> 00:39:57,609
you know units

823
00:39:57,609 --> 00:39:58,659
of payment

824
00:39:58,659 --> 00:40:02,779
um... and the mir is usually programmed
never left outside believed in in her

825
00:40:02,779 --> 00:40:03,889
report

826
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:05,130
it's its

827
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:08,750
its program so that when you push
graduated enters a unit of time our unit

828
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:12,380
of currency in annette byrnes he's been
translated or part of it and i want

829
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,300
something that's on them

830
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,289
despite of us

831
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:17,039
terms he can actually see

832
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,460
but other parts of this device

833
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,369
well and this indicate your name which
is an early predecessor to

834
00:40:23,369 --> 00:40:27,729
uh... maturity and that was uh... within
seven to spend

835
00:40:27,729 --> 00:40:28,779
and

836
00:40:28,779 --> 00:40:32,359
uh... we can actually have kilometers
from san francisco if we had to have

837
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:35,808
maybe photos of a group of reporters or
something will be able to confirm the

838
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:38,359
exact agree that we're able to attack

839
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:42,779
uh... usual oddly like i said to as you
can see on the top right that's actually

840
00:40:42,779 --> 00:40:43,849
the quarantine

841
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:47,269
they wanna make sure that you can you
hear me that you can investor

842
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:51,049
anymore on the left is of course not
cheap to manufacture by comparison

843
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:55,859
and the bottom right is the electrically
isolated smartpros circuit

844
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:59,719
and some of these medicines are really
anderson for example they have multi

845
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:04,640
space we are so you park a motorcycle or
the or or six cars or something in a row

846
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,658
and uh...

847
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:09,139
but the smart card in the u_k_ and you
you have to tell which spot they're

848
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:10,230
paying for first

849
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:14,070
i actually was able to through a series
of fortune events

850
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:17,820
uh... actually see inside of one of
these devices and i talk to this guy

851
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,700
basically who worked over the city and i
was going to work with regard to maybe

852
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,419
you could tell me about computers

853
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,899
and she like talking about these meters
for quite some time

854
00:41:26,899 --> 00:41:29,669
and what he was talking i looked at the
meter and i noticed that there is a

855
00:41:29,669 --> 00:41:33,319
would basically it's a real connection
from let's marker device directly into

856
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:35,119
this report of the end of the computer

857
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,889
so that manufacturer use the saints
marker to interpret it into the uh...

858
00:41:39,889 --> 00:41:40,610
uses it

859
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,670
totally different method for

860
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,119
uh... electrically isolating that's not
quite system

861
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,880
which is to say as far as i can tell
they don't mess with it

862
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,430
just kind of bad news uh... on the right
you can see in nineteen forty five and

863
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:58,279
after which were you plug in and has
some different biofilms

864
00:41:58,279 --> 00:42:00,809
and here you can see uh...

865
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,650
so we bought them a commuter on ebay

866
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:06,510
and here you can sort of zulu little the
game on the protectors of off-base

867
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:10,220
you can see that we're actually using an
outgoing oscilloscope to probe the meter

868
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,180
so we

869
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,450
figured out how to put the the reader
into reset

870
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,848
and then upon reset probing the
different kinds which would be

871
00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:18,089
oscilloscope it allowed us to

872
00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:21,859
to sort of see what the meter does upon
boot so we were able to actually start

873
00:42:21,859 --> 00:42:25,379
to get like a actual date out once you
realize though this is a nice greasy

874
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:26,250
votes

875
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:29,300
uh... this is a you know what lesson
this is businesses that

876
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,380
and we surgery of the profile these pins
and trace depends on the board in

877
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,220
separate stepped up to see

878
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:38,968
which things interconnect aware which is
quite useful

879
00:42:38,969 --> 00:42:43,079
if you were to do this is how you do
from white house is probably

880
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:44,819
yesterday

881
00:42:44,819 --> 00:42:46,808
uh... soccer analysis is

882
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:47,980
pretty straightforward

883
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:53,900
uh... how many view of excellent wasn't
smart cards before

884
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,019
uh... right so

885
00:42:56,019 --> 00:42:59,078
actually is referred to

886
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:01,799
so we're going to dive into sailing
tuesday and then that's how we're going

887
00:43:01,799 --> 00:43:06,538
to talk about stuff analysis um... so on
the left hand side b c parking meter

888
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:09,139
and the applicant lurking parking card

889
00:43:09,139 --> 00:43:10,239
for senators go

890
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:13,220
uh... which slides in uh... and uh...

891
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:17,649
it pays and related cases imagine you
had a will quarters in your hair

892
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:22,269
uh... basically de becker and you put it
in and now you wait a second

893
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:24,459
when you pick up another quarter and put
it in

894
00:43:24,459 --> 00:43:27,019
and you do that with precise timing
everytime

895
00:43:27,019 --> 00:43:30,569
that's what it's like to use one of
those cards it's not fast or convenient

896
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:31,599
in that regard

897
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,349
bombing on the rights the

898
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:37,099
uh... modesty is needed and i discussed
it has no electoral isolation between

899
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:39,080
the smart card in the actual data
computer

900
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,729
and you've got a computer and there's
much more advanced

901
00:43:41,729 --> 00:43:45,379
from what i saw anybody commuter that i
believe is in this for the last

902
00:43:45,379 --> 00:43:48,129
uh... this on the right actually had a
nasty card in it

903
00:43:48,129 --> 00:43:51,919
so maybe it's running like a free
software operating system brooding often

904
00:43:51,919 --> 00:43:53,470
a speaker i've no idea

905
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:55,589
but it looked like a small board

906
00:43:55,589 --> 00:43:57,670
that would basically be something

907
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:00,040
uh... the just interfaces with uh...
serial port

908
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,370
and so it'd be quite intersting back

909
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,109
to see how how that works

910
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:05,219
to see the traffic

911
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:08,959
uh... if you for example wanted to speed
up some of his analysis i guess you

912
00:44:08,959 --> 00:44:12,499
could probably uh... like if you can buy
one of those meters online you could

913
00:44:12,499 --> 00:44:13,509
probably do

914
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:16,400
some really interesting else was about

915
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,670
on the left to close the old meters that
were being replaced them on the right is

916
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:22,500
another new trial where they're putting
credit cards and

917
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,109
i find that to be a little bit horrific
if only because if they need is battling

918
00:44:26,109 --> 00:44:28,479
engineered bashing on the right

919
00:44:28,479 --> 00:44:32,118
edited this machine on the laughing this
one on the right

920
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:33,559
struggles all the way down

921
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:34,689
yes

922
00:44:34,689 --> 00:44:36,538
because basically

923
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:40,699
if you want to you as an evil person or
as an attacker

924
00:44:40,699 --> 00:44:42,849
if you can't open this device

925
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:44,240
in all bets are off

926
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,339
everyone says physical security all bets
are off anywhere that you could make it

927
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,359
so that if you open the rice and change
it

928
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,970
but it destroys itself needs to be reset
by administrator for example

929
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:55,379
i don't believe they've done that

930
00:44:55,379 --> 00:44:57,308
given what we see the other matters

931
00:44:57,309 --> 00:45:00,679
uh... so it's probably a case that
someone can build a small device that

932
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:03,440
sits between the credit card reader the
mag stripe reader

933
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,579
and actual invented computer

934
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:07,070
because it's probably modular

935
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:11,199
you can call we slipped up off and
unless they have set it up in a

936
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:12,430
well waited till they haven't

937
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:16,379
um... it's going just it's going to be
probably i said it is it's going to flow

938
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:22,709
class and that's a well-known format an
actual it up but that might convince

939
00:45:22,709 --> 00:45:26,118
that's bad news for the future is more
bad news from san francisco and

940
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:28,309
of liberals

941
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,819
uh... we spend thirty five million
dollars to get them

942
00:45:30,819 --> 00:45:33,570
the city is considering putting a
parking meter

943
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,599
in every single parking meters

944
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:36,900
possible space

945
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,470
so that is to say every meter space

946
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,769
that is an on private property they want
for a partner

947
00:45:42,769 --> 00:45:46,258
so like outside your house

948
00:45:46,259 --> 00:45:48,989
it's crazy

949
00:45:48,989 --> 00:45:50,119
are you thinking

950
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:53,499
because i i mean mike and wait like
indian named california-berkeley there

951
00:45:53,499 --> 00:45:54,348
is a guy

952
00:45:54,349 --> 00:45:58,569
or a woman or someone working with
people that went through the city uh...

953
00:45:58,569 --> 00:46:01,079
and i don't know if any of you seem cool
hand luke

954
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:04,009
uh... but it's a movie where it starts
off by the guy

955
00:46:04,009 --> 00:46:07,539
having basically elected cutting device
in just walks through the city and it

956
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:09,949
starts cutting off parking meter have

957
00:46:09,949 --> 00:46:12,429
but these days did that in berkeley

958
00:46:12,429 --> 00:46:15,819
and they did before and entire area of
the city

959
00:46:15,819 --> 00:46:17,179
and it's about what

960
00:46:17,179 --> 00:46:19,810
all like all leaders in that area of the
city

961
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,799
as a acted civil disobedience but don't
you know you know do non democratically

962
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,809
or going to respond on democratically

963
00:46:25,809 --> 00:46:28,209
and the cost of replacing them is too
much

964
00:46:28,209 --> 00:46:32,269
and so for awhile usually parking in
berkeley

965
00:46:32,269 --> 00:46:36,149
has done in a successful uh... tenuate
no one's going on in silence is still an

966
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:39,720
intent even harder to imagine doing i
made an unsolved lead you would need to

967
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,638
take up three hundred and twenty
thousand parking meters

968
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:47,289
and it would really need to be
distributed effort

969
00:46:47,289 --> 00:46:52,509
uh... so bizarre bazaar kurtz that you
can buy they're not chargeable

970
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:56,200
on the outside here two things that are
interesting one of the times you value

971
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,509
on the bottom right hand corner

972
00:46:58,509 --> 00:46:59,649
it tells you

973
00:46:59,649 --> 00:47:02,098
the serial number

974
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:04,280
this is great because it means that you
start off

975
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:10,099
with knowing a value and doing a piece
of known plaintext

976
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:13,969
basically because of her get serial
number on the outside he was trivial

977
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:16,660
to be able to look at a capture that we
have done

978
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:20,250
uh... with an oscilloscope or lawful
scope you know out on the street

979
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:22,780
in services group you want to get away
with anything at all

980
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:27,649
and just have to make sure that when you
the parties and missus clinton project

981
00:47:27,649 --> 00:47:33,038
all

982
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:35,980
so uh... you know the kit you can
imagine uh...

983
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,149
to dive so that i've always wanted to
work with computers

984
00:47:39,149 --> 00:47:43,720
are sitting there with an oscilloscope
powered by nec inverter on a car

985
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,319
at a parking meter spots the miller with
the meter

986
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:47,339
you know like

987
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:50,350
using that to capture traffic from a
legitimate car

988
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:53,389
and then taking that recording data back
to the laboratory in

989
00:47:53,389 --> 00:47:56,799
encino and people in trying to get out
and it's like the eureka moments when we

990
00:47:56,799 --> 00:47:58,439
sought to remember

991
00:47:58,439 --> 00:48:00,629
so i quote we interpret the data

992
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:03,779
as a decreasing ministerial many
secunderabad

993
00:48:03,779 --> 00:48:05,250
then predict the serial number

994
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,160
that must be with the communication
protocol is they must be a sickness or

995
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,249
an exiting about

996
00:48:10,249 --> 00:48:11,238
or how about that

997
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:14,289
now if we can't have a serial number to
call me would have been possible to

998
00:48:14,289 --> 00:48:15,419
determine that

999
00:48:15,419 --> 00:48:18,759
ending interannual a but the mere fact
that was on the outside is a necessity

1000
00:48:18,759 --> 00:48:21,819
for using administration for selling
part of that

1001
00:48:21,819 --> 00:48:23,509
but it's really kind of police

1002
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:26,390
because it also really eaten breaking it
it goes to show that just like one

1003
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:29,419
single clues really all that you need

1004
00:48:29,419 --> 00:48:31,859
anyway we were able to break in three
days

1005
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:34,740
and that is the same three days we were
able to take captures

1006
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:38,729
and we were able to make an emulator

1007
00:48:38,729 --> 00:48:39,578
basically

1008
00:48:39,579 --> 00:48:43,039
uh... we also sent to protect the kurds

1009
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:44,599
she

1010
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:47,659
decree analysis and he said it's
supposed to show you a second

1011
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:49,389
but elation emulator

1012
00:48:49,389 --> 00:48:53,079
to go to the euro trade on your laptop
you can download the source code for the

1013
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:53,930
emulator

1014
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:57,960
and you can buy silver card online from
australia or the united kingdom for

1015
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,579
about five dollars or so

1016
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:01,559
and you can compile the source code

1017
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:04,949
uh... we've taken out the special cards
and uh... the codes aren't certain no

1018
00:49:04,949 --> 00:49:07,799
one here wants to defraud the sandwiches
for parking agency so it's kind of a

1019
00:49:07,799 --> 00:49:10,259
relevant to tell you that we take it out
to protect them

1020
00:49:10,259 --> 00:49:12,999
we also take it out because we're going
to do and

1021
00:49:12,999 --> 00:49:14,609
very silly things but

1022
00:49:14,609 --> 00:49:17,359
basically the only thing stopping
someone from getting his attackers under

1023
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,710
settlement can be done so it doesn't
really matter if you have any later

1024
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:23,949
but if you want to look at another
system anyone being elses

1025
00:49:23,949 --> 00:49:29,059
we're happy that you could take a
skilled in using so run but i guess

1026
00:49:29,059 --> 00:49:31,029
pages uh...

1027
00:49:31,029 --> 00:49:34,920
as i said previously i had told us guys
i really wanted to worker computers and

1028
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:39,259
they told me all sorts of things about
the meters and

1029
00:49:39,259 --> 00:49:42,149
it was pretty useful to me it was after
the guy just for knowing that it was

1030
00:49:42,149 --> 00:49:43,630
worth starting on the project

1031
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:46,550
and of course just looking around the
internet help find information about the

1032
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,390
specifications that they would use and
how they sell them and how much money

1033
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:54,098
they spend inner operate in things like
this

1034
00:49:54,099 --> 00:49:56,830
i really liked this uh... itsme
frightening

1035
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:01,239
but we don't have the senior software
designers

1036
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:02,599
name from this e-mail

1037
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:07,259
uh... this is an excerpt from a sequin
mailing list post which heroes of the

1038
00:50:07,259 --> 00:50:09,389
bottoms life here

1039
00:50:09,389 --> 00:50:12,089
returned at some point you post online
later

1040
00:50:12,089 --> 00:50:14,659
the question that i often aspects of the
slick what kind of trouble with these

1041
00:50:14,659 --> 00:50:17,679
people have implementing the system and
when they have trouble how do they look

1042
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:19,089
for

1043
00:50:19,089 --> 00:50:20,179
answers

1044
00:50:20,179 --> 00:50:23,380
and the answer in this case is and i
want to read this and it's not really

1045
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,329
i mean everybody

1046
00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:28,299
like us trouble retinoid or knowing use
computers

1047
00:50:28,299 --> 00:50:33,009
but in this case i just thought this was
a kid the most often email defined ever

1048
00:50:33,009 --> 00:50:36,729
i am learning how to use e_d_s_ and as
part of this process i've set up a test

1049
00:50:36,729 --> 00:50:37,950
repository to

1050
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:40,928
scarecrows

1051
00:50:40,929 --> 00:50:43,049
and he shows the output

1052
00:50:43,049 --> 00:50:44,910
of what you think

1053
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,990
i wouldn't fight this type of writing
this email

1054
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:50,538
uh... but i've prolly one one to work
with them

1055
00:50:50,539 --> 00:50:53,489
but that's a pesticide no but if you
look you see that he's using witnesses

1056
00:50:53,489 --> 00:50:54,859
windows you know

1057
00:50:54,859 --> 00:50:56,540
ninety something probably

1058
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:59,269
nothing good

1059
00:50:59,269 --> 00:51:03,598
if you sort of look at the top received
it in the case of his his company name

1060
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,019
and then you go down a little further
and you see jan please

1061
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:10,589
she made it makes the smart card to turn
the program

1062
00:51:10,589 --> 00:51:13,389
uh... you see also gcc

1063
00:51:13,389 --> 00:51:17,329
so if you again for more analysis on the
phone went this guy producers to work

1064
00:51:17,329 --> 00:51:20,839
with jade in the case jim please
implementation

1065
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:23,369
you probably know how quick it was going
to be structured

1066
00:51:23,369 --> 00:51:26,829
in the from line up

1067
00:51:26,829 --> 00:51:28,709
i mean that's

1068
00:51:28,709 --> 00:51:30,999
but even better is the past

1069
00:51:30,999 --> 00:51:34,428
the colon slash source working you
purchase

1070
00:51:34,429 --> 00:51:37,519
what you personal components and sister

1071
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:42,229
people who need to learn how you see the
yes

1072
00:51:42,229 --> 00:51:44,198
anyway we decathlete cards

1073
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:47,220
uh... basically you throat the cards by
cutting

1074
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:48,430
coming up a smart cards

1075
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:51,928
and you toss them into fuming packing
nitric acid

1076
00:51:51,929 --> 00:51:53,619
uh... you know

1077
00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:56,279
uh... and then as a result

1078
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:59,290
you're basically able to tell that there
are two things one is a custom

1079
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:00,788
uh... fab basic

1080
00:52:00,789 --> 00:52:04,289
bernie it's not custom for san francisco
but they clearly designed as a sick and

1081
00:52:04,289 --> 00:52:07,289
the other one is an eight oh five one
microcontroller that actually emulates

1082
00:52:07,289 --> 00:52:10,139
basically earlier exit part of the
reasonably they did this was for

1083
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:13,460
backward compatibility public realizing
you can make a programmable

1084
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:17,010
because just having a safety basically
at the for the car with me to change the

1085
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:17,879
protocol

1086
00:52:17,879 --> 00:52:22,139
maybe you can reprogram the gem club
member parts

1087
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:25,670
basically um... you could grab the
confirm this

1088
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:29,099
people each of your views uh...
specially christopher water and

1089
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:31,659
you can grab back here to go

1090
00:52:31,659 --> 00:52:35,049
you can basically see here on the left
and he said

1091
00:52:35,049 --> 00:52:37,889
and on the right you can see the general
purpose

1092
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:39,679
uh... programmable

1093
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:41,889
and about one

1094
00:52:41,889 --> 00:52:44,429
you can tell the difference between the
two of them but you can also now know

1095
00:52:44,429 --> 00:52:46,190
which one you're looking at and

1096
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:49,630
in theory if you see the one on the left
you might have a harder time but once

1097
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:51,399
you break it they have our time

1098
00:52:51,399 --> 00:52:54,149
and on the right you might have an
easier time cuz you can come to go to

1099
00:52:54,149 --> 00:52:56,538
but they also have an easier time
responding

1100
00:52:56,539 --> 00:53:00,439
are an addiction sisters changed with
the work so it's good

1101
00:53:00,439 --> 00:53:03,308
it's kind of not really that important
supposed that they have this program

1102
00:53:03,309 --> 00:53:07,719
both thing intellectual user

1103
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:11,819
the have and implementation which is

1104
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:14,299
straight-up lie so seventy eight sixty

1105
00:53:14,299 --> 00:53:15,820
so if you read this pact

1106
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:19,720
you get an idea uh... specifically if
you look at park three electric pass

1107
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:23,488
signals and uh... transition because
you'll see

1108
00:53:23,489 --> 00:53:26,659
it's jack would you expect

1109
00:53:26,659 --> 00:53:29,689
this week the diagrammatic article

1110
00:53:29,689 --> 00:53:31,839
with his own unimportant paper

1111
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:34,349
uh... basically tells you how to tap

1112
00:53:34,349 --> 00:53:35,639
you know where you wanna

1113
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:37,159
put your prose

1114
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:38,819
uh... we use the sham

1115
00:53:38,819 --> 00:53:39,570
and then

1116
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:42,999
using mission and we were able to
moderate

1117
00:53:42,999 --> 00:53:45,448
these are some of the competition
protocols we found that there was a

1118
00:53:45,449 --> 00:53:46,899
cigarettes

1119
00:53:46,899 --> 00:53:49,129
uh... that's the ship

1120
00:53:49,129 --> 00:53:51,098
on the operator inside

1121
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:52,920
it's a normal smart car

1122
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,589
inside of option to change put into the
meter and then there's probst

1123
00:53:57,589 --> 00:54:00,669
for the points on the part two of the
monarchy fishing for

1124
00:54:00,669 --> 00:54:04,549
and we found that it was a synchronous
elements attended by eighty one

1125
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:06,989
and we were able to course

1126
00:54:06,989 --> 00:54:12,349
because it and then once had to cut it
we found but there's a protocol

1127
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:15,589
this is a great way to know that things
are working out for you

1128
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:19,578
is it well-being to decode if you have
one of these ads on skype simply great

1129
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:21,200
uh... you will find

1130
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:25,299
that it is possible to just literally
turner by along the

1131
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,669
on the on the pro

1132
00:54:26,669 --> 00:54:28,308
or on the scope

1133
00:54:28,309 --> 00:54:31,719
and with one captured you can interpret
the data in many different ways we can

1134
00:54:31,719 --> 00:54:33,999
literally destroyed on sale voter

1135
00:54:33,999 --> 00:54:35,629
and sure enough we did that

1136
00:54:35,629 --> 00:54:39,788
and we found the answer to reset code
which is what you would expect

1137
00:54:39,789 --> 00:54:41,339
didn't your sends this

1138
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:42,909
and democrat response

1139
00:54:42,909 --> 00:54:47,239
and went to once you know you've got
that you're in

1140
00:54:47,239 --> 00:54:48,799
we grabbed a bunch of stuff

1141
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:51,279
uh... basically monitor bunch
communications omitted differential

1142
00:54:51,279 --> 00:54:54,249
analysis on the different indications
the things that were the same were

1143
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,799
obviously the setup that things are
different were obviously

1144
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,810
how the card

1145
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:58,899
was different

1146
00:54:58,899 --> 00:55:00,348
card the card

1147
00:55:00,349 --> 00:55:02,330
uh... secures the protocol

1148
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:03,870
uh... and what you

1149
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:05,120
reverses it first

1150
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:09,719
gets attacked carter

1151
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:11,949
i'm gonna show you the protocol and then
you just have to raise your hand when

1152
00:55:11,949 --> 00:55:13,659
you see a problem

1153
00:55:13,659 --> 00:55:14,930
to here

1154
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:17,940
use sitting in the car and part response

1155
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:21,059
and then the region in their asks again

1156
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:25,009
and then of course it asks for something
else and then it asks for something else

1157
00:55:25,009 --> 00:55:28,239
and that's for something else

1158
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:30,939
at this point leader says well okay

1159
00:55:30,939 --> 00:55:32,868
uh... regular

1160
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:34,829
coehlo

1161
00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:35,939
i'd like to read this

1162
00:55:35,939 --> 00:55:39,009
let me give you the password for
authorizing you

1163
00:55:39,009 --> 00:55:39,969
architecting

1164
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:44,189
everything's going back to a vote you
tell me about it

1165
00:55:44,189 --> 00:55:47,609
article will using committed

1166
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:48,830
forty use now

1167
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:50,819
right well now we know

1168
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:52,399
p_b_m_'s

1169
00:55:52,399 --> 00:55:59,399
tivities but the problem

1170
00:56:00,969 --> 00:56:06,369
certainly details without the password
and what is the kardi

1171
00:56:06,369 --> 00:56:08,619
so much for your favorite

1172
00:56:08,619 --> 00:56:12,199
that takes expert

1173
00:56:12,199 --> 00:56:19,199
so what does that mean this year mutual
delegation

1174
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:31,589
and will be out there that was executed
in the meter i guess uh... essentially

1175
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:33,189
the issue here is that

1176
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:35,749
if you're reading anyway different and
more

1177
00:56:35,749 --> 00:56:38,709
you don't need to know how the other
than what

1178
00:56:38,709 --> 00:56:41,189
you say yes

1179
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,388
just say yes

1180
00:56:43,389 --> 00:56:46,159
i think that's a personal invite

1181
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:49,690
by anyway so that's headed here at its
balance

1182
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:52,800
uh... and basically there's a counter in
the colors used as part of the

1183
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:57,629
calculation and when the calculation is
done it shows the value on the mir

1184
00:56:57,629 --> 00:56:58,859
so for example

1185
00:56:58,859 --> 00:57:02,369
these are the values which are stored on
the card so

1186
00:57:02,369 --> 00:57:05,839
it's telling people to get smart cards
they're like often act that

1187
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,769
yeah just like really difficult

1188
00:57:07,769 --> 00:57:10,508
basically it's uh... a bunch of data

1189
00:57:10,509 --> 00:57:14,350
on a car and some of that data is that
will do it all addressable areas

1190
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:18,230
and that it is sort of the card and you
can change that data so at some points

1191
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:21,539
there's a value and when you calculate
the value you see that

1192
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:23,829
if it's not ewga does units

1193
00:57:23,829 --> 00:57:25,460
as represented on that card

1194
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:28,650
are in fact recorder woman the values
twenty dollars and otherwise it's a

1195
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:30,649
fifty dollar cart so

1196
00:57:30,649 --> 00:57:34,529
so if you have for example

1197
00:57:34,529 --> 00:57:36,669
and you capture

1198
00:57:36,669 --> 00:57:39,098
you can do what

1199
00:57:39,099 --> 00:57:41,209
you can change a value to be

1200
00:57:41,209 --> 00:57:42,939
something else

1201
00:57:42,939 --> 00:57:47,808
and so if you have four thousand units
when you get

1202
00:57:47,809 --> 00:57:53,639
you get that

1203
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:54,590
aso

1204
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:56,760
uh... the best part about this parking
meter card

1205
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:57,919
is that it's

1206
00:57:57,919 --> 00:57:59,449
part of the silver card

1207
00:57:59,449 --> 00:58:03,489
and that is basically use personal
attacking you can also pop up a silver

1208
00:58:03,489 --> 00:58:07,119
card you have what looks like a same so
it's like a salient simulator so if you

1209
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:08,260
want to get good

1210
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:09,749
right that's an annular

1211
00:58:09,749 --> 00:58:13,098
uh... its contents of the it's probably
easier to buy bloodstains

1212
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:16,989
uh... going to do that but let me start
attacking that's news for sunlight and

1213
00:58:16,989 --> 00:58:19,889
you start work for a dedication to
underwrite you're accustomed dentition

1214
00:58:19,889 --> 00:58:22,660
system this would be a great way to
protect that right

1215
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:26,609
but not a great way to likely been
implemented probably of they weren't so

1216
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:28,359
this card when you pull that out

1217
00:58:28,359 --> 00:58:31,739
first of all almost looks like the same
in cisco camera it's not like some crazy

1218
00:58:31,739 --> 00:58:35,379
pisa partner with wires hanging out that
or something like our like a big chip

1219
00:58:35,379 --> 00:58:38,439
it fits in your wallet there are no
problems with that part

1220
00:58:38,439 --> 00:58:42,729
uh... you could also dead and a custom
assoc screen printed on it and you would

1221
00:58:42,729 --> 00:58:43,968
pass you know

1222
00:58:43,969 --> 00:58:46,499
this car every he pulled out

1223
00:58:46,499 --> 00:58:50,718
you put a cases in value and the reason
is because it's powered by the media

1224
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:51,909
snow batters

1225
00:58:51,909 --> 00:58:54,069
but by the leader and one of powers up

1226
00:58:54,069 --> 00:58:57,129
it just starts at its initial programs
that he doesn't remember that you ever

1227
00:58:57,129 --> 00:58:58,400
deducted money from it

1228
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:03,279
so it's a lot of refilling cartridge

1229
00:59:03,279 --> 00:59:07,019
uh... so we met a bunch of suggestions
to the city

1230
00:59:07,019 --> 00:59:10,339
basically you should definitely reduce
the tax service

1231
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:13,599
and you should probably also make sure
that when you open circuits that they

1232
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:18,159
could be destroy themselves uh... we
also really encourage them to don't like

1233
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:20,930
uh... a mesh network that would actually
be useful so if everyone

1234
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:24,080
eager to talk to every other year you
could know where parking spaces where

1235
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,710
he didn't look at traffic congestion you
could actually serve a purpose other

1236
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:29,139
than just taking peoples money

1237
00:59:29,139 --> 00:59:31,050
which i think is not the world's
greatest progress

1238
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:32,190
and alternatively

1239
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:35,869
they should work on implementing doctor
david johnson on the seat s systems

1240
00:59:35,869 --> 00:59:36,549
features

1241
00:59:36,549 --> 00:59:38,230
if he were to look at

1242
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:40,119
the way to see some of the cash problems

1243
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:45,419
you'd realize that they were solving the
same problem that they had done wrong

1244
00:59:45,419 --> 00:59:48,779
it seems like it's important that this
issue do that at least in two senses

1245
00:59:48,779 --> 00:59:52,659
this case because i think that they are
contributing to calif living and fraud

1246
00:59:52,659 --> 00:59:55,539
nation something that

1247
00:59:55,539 --> 00:59:56,730
so we

1248
00:59:56,730 --> 01:00:01,219
also sort of feel like people trust this
hardware

1249
01:00:01,219 --> 01:00:04,359
and wanna make sure that people can
point to our presentations and say

1250
01:00:04,359 --> 01:00:05,590
yes i got a parking ticket

1251
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:08,420
but the parking ticket is on just a
moment show you what these leaders are

1252
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:09,429
crap

1253
01:00:09,429 --> 01:00:12,239
and then you can hopefully getting

1254
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:13,100
given a ticket

1255
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,170
especially if it's legitimately
indicates

1256
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:19,759
that you have got to get when you have
previously

1257
01:00:19,759 --> 01:00:23,450
internal we want to encourage people
sees this as a platform for rent

1258
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:25,098
bicycles

1259
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:26,750
uh... if you have a car

1260
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:27,849
and you don't need one

1261
01:00:27,849 --> 01:00:29,230
please consider getting rid of it

1262
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:30,769
ride a bicycle instead

1263
01:00:30,769 --> 01:00:34,339
image for a much better world

1264
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:38,519
so after of course here

1265
01:00:38,519 --> 01:00:42,569
we're going to switch gears from their
supper together separately going into

1266
01:00:42,569 --> 01:00:43,640
magnetic strips

1267
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:48,799
uh... and i think i have like just a
little bit of time here to u_s_ so

1268
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:49,759
you can read that

1269
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,690
yet ok so how we learn to love overland
smith and his ideas in eighteen seventy

1270
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:55,999
eight about magnetic recording

1271
01:00:55,999 --> 01:00:58,578
okay so very brief history of magnetic
recording

1272
01:00:58,579 --> 01:01:00,150
oberlin smith essentially

1273
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:04,680
this is one of the very first people to
talk about the phenomenon of uh...

1274
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,819
magnetic recording of the first person
to talk about magnetics necessarily but

1275
01:01:07,819 --> 01:01:11,210
the first person to talk about recording
and he proposed a wire system

1276
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:14,619
that would be possible to uh...
essentially include

1277
01:01:14,619 --> 01:01:18,009
some sort of signal onto uh... so

1278
01:01:18,009 --> 01:01:21,579
he had this idea literally in eighteen
seventy eight so over a hundred years

1279
01:01:21,579 --> 01:01:25,359
ago someone thought that would be great
idea if i could take some sort of signal

1280
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:28,749
and you can see if you can't touch it
and it doesn't like really matter if

1281
01:01:28,749 --> 01:01:32,538
they're material itself is really is
something that is uh...

1282
01:01:32,539 --> 01:01:36,269
you know uh... rub against humans or
it's like somehow balanced returned or

1283
01:01:36,269 --> 01:01:39,538
something like it's intrinsically
inputted into the actual thing itself

1284
01:01:39,539 --> 01:01:40,919
and it's a great idea

1285
01:01:40,919 --> 01:01:44,589
uh... ta basically didn't really do very
much of that idea but he was really

1286
01:01:44,589 --> 01:01:47,558
fixated on it for the next twenty years

1287
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:51,070
however of love in your polson did
actually do something with it

1288
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:54,570
and he essentially create the very first
voicemail system by using a wire

1289
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:56,849
soon bc ninety years old and smith

1290
01:01:56,849 --> 01:01:59,789
and she created this thing called the
telegraph

1291
01:01:59,789 --> 01:02:02,879
or telegraphing or every part of this

1292
01:02:02,879 --> 01:02:05,399
keys uh... from denmark

1293
01:02:05,399 --> 01:02:06,859
park it was before he died

1294
01:02:06,859 --> 01:02:10,709
and in eighteen eighty eight he actually
came up with this device and then later

1295
01:02:10,709 --> 01:02:12,120
patented the device

1296
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:16,269
so basically the very first voicemail
system would actually a wire

1297
01:02:16,269 --> 01:02:18,549
that you know it included analog data

1298
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:22,069
and and using an electrical field it was
able to add a magnet

1299
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:25,589
he was able to essentially all sleep if
you in a way that the wire itself held

1300
01:02:25,589 --> 01:02:26,578
the message

1301
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:29,719
that's gotta be most arcane voicemail
system ever

1302
01:02:29,719 --> 01:02:33,519
and i don't know any phone preach that
impact of wire voice mail system

1303
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:36,299
but i guess that's uh... go for the
future

1304
01:02:36,299 --> 01:02:40,139
you really have any sort of like access
control or things like that

1305
01:02:40,139 --> 01:02:41,450
there's always problem cuz

1306
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:44,210
he thought that was really annoying that
people could communicate but they would

1307
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:47,329
really be able to leave messages for
each other

1308
01:02:47,329 --> 01:02:48,509
i think that

1309
01:02:48,509 --> 01:02:49,849
that is really

1310
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:50,870
amazing work

1311
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:53,029
i mean the wire recorder is

1312
01:02:53,029 --> 01:02:56,879
often forgotten about and is a pretty
interesting piece of technology and his

1313
01:02:56,879 --> 01:02:58,419
overall

1314
01:02:58,419 --> 01:02:59,190
basically

1315
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:02,309
the root of all of the designs became
fed ex hundred years

1316
01:03:02,309 --> 01:03:05,329
it basically people saw that was
possible because of his work so these

1317
01:03:05,329 --> 01:03:09,619
two guys that are basically the reason
that we have anything with magnetics

1318
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,949
and aside from these two guys are a few
other important people but basically

1319
01:03:12,949 --> 01:03:17,339
these are the people that that made it
possible for you dot hard drives

1320
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:20,939
in your laptop right now that work with
magnetic technology

1321
01:03:20,939 --> 01:03:24,089
and they're really saying they had
pretty interesting lives they had other

1322
01:03:24,089 --> 01:03:27,689
interesting inventions and ideas and i
highly recommend you read about them

1323
01:03:27,689 --> 01:03:32,569
because they're with interesting that

1324
01:03:32,569 --> 01:03:34,520
basically there were

1325
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:38,009
a whole series of inventions they
haven't really slowly

1326
01:03:38,009 --> 01:03:39,309
over the next

1327
01:03:39,309 --> 01:03:41,109
essentially hundred years intel

1328
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:42,558
basically the sixties

1329
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:45,920
uh... things weren't really that
interesting uh... in terms of some

1330
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,659
practical for every every two years

1331
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:51,750
but basically the wire reporters were
the big thing for quite some time

1332
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:53,049
and part of the reason

1333
01:03:53,049 --> 01:03:56,699
that lighter recorders existed

1334
01:03:56,699 --> 01:04:00,279
we take for granted to the idea that you
could have a tree

1335
01:04:00,279 --> 01:04:01,350
is flexible

1336
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:06,029
and is essentially uh... people to have
us all of material inside of it that's

1337
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:06,819
magnetic

1338
01:04:06,819 --> 01:04:09,288
and uh... you can be moved in some way

1339
01:04:09,289 --> 01:04:11,190
that site such a novel idea

1340
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:13,959
when you look at oberlin smith's
original ideas

1341
01:04:13,959 --> 01:04:15,959
it's it's kind of incredible

1342
01:04:15,959 --> 01:04:17,310
sue from y recorders

1343
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:20,069
we as a as a race went to

1344
01:04:20,069 --> 01:04:20,920
steel tape

1345
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,609
if you can imagine that a piece of metal

1346
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:24,770
that's just flat

1347
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:26,869
and the committee

1348
01:04:26,869 --> 01:04:29,520
it was extremely fragile okay

1349
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,810
it was heavy and difficult to work with
and it could be fragile in the sense

1350
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:36,650
that if you're working with a view of
many bend it and now you've what bent

1351
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:40,139
this thing and you have to read and edit
maybe you're gonna screw up

1352
01:04:40,139 --> 01:04:41,009
the device

1353
01:04:41,009 --> 01:04:43,719
where you're going to screw up the
actual taking away that the question i

1354
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:44,759
want to read it

1355
01:04:44,759 --> 01:04:48,529
uh... system civilian work out so well
so people started looking at making

1356
01:04:48,529 --> 01:04:50,649
paper tapes

1357
01:04:50,649 --> 01:04:53,609
that was great for a while and certainly
was an improvement over still thinks

1358
01:04:53,609 --> 01:04:54,750
it's a pity broke

1359
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:58,920
so that one is reliable and of course
the actual uh... the actual tape itself

1360
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,230
was not necessarily degrees quality

1361
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:05,550
uh... and it'd be produced of allot of
noise in the signal oven is basically

1362
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:08,869
just a and what are your recording for
the most part

1363
01:05:08,869 --> 01:05:12,979
which is tartar like look uh... the
evolution of magnetic stripes you start

1364
01:05:12,979 --> 01:05:13,640
to see that

1365
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:16,609
the root of all of the nitrate
technology that we use today basically

1366
01:05:16,609 --> 01:05:18,549
comes from a wire recorder

1367
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:21,529
and and the nineteenth century

1368
01:05:21,529 --> 01:05:24,460
uh... around the end of world war two

1369
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:28,560
um... there was the second voicemail
system created uh... which was the

1370
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,229
british male voice

1371
01:05:30,229 --> 01:05:33,069
uh... it's not really were still in the
sense that you leave a message it's more

1372
01:05:33,069 --> 01:05:37,669
like you record your message you fold
adi paper desk in half

1373
01:05:37,669 --> 01:05:39,249
he put it in envelope

1374
01:05:39,249 --> 01:05:42,808
and then you put a stamp on the envelope
and redwoods too and then you put it in

1375
01:05:42,809 --> 01:05:46,139
mail box in a week later they get it and
they open the envelope and then take the

1376
01:05:46,139 --> 01:05:50,979
discounted put in there according to
play the message

1377
01:05:50,979 --> 01:05:51,819
possibly

1378
01:05:51,819 --> 01:05:53,808
that's a lot of them

1379
01:05:53,809 --> 01:05:55,649
they took in fifteen years

1380
01:05:55,649 --> 01:05:58,350
to change the technology to get the
equivalent idea

1381
01:05:58,350 --> 01:05:59,620
but really if you think about it

1382
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:03,880
uh... eagerly wire recorder that um...
but we're possum created was actually

1383
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,329
uh... cylinder

1384
01:06:05,329 --> 01:06:08,050
uh... essentially what about the stall

1385
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:10,479
and had uh... series of rods

1386
01:06:10,479 --> 01:06:12,408
they had a wire loop

1387
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:13,920
basically through the entire thing

1388
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,839
and there was a red-headed would spin
around it

1389
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:21,469
but subsequently heavy and gary prone to
breaking sos paper discos actually like

1390
01:06:21,469 --> 01:06:24,059
quite a step forward

1391
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:27,369
but he was very short they didn't allow
for recording of a lot of messages it

1392
01:06:27,369 --> 01:06:29,390
wasn't particularly love reliable

1393
01:06:29,390 --> 01:06:32,538
uh... unfolding the paper of course like

1394
01:06:32,539 --> 01:06:35,819
made the device or maybe just a little
bit bus often

1395
01:06:35,819 --> 01:06:39,979
ang lee eventually we figured out it was
possible to make plastic like

1396
01:06:39,979 --> 01:06:42,990
and then to suspend a magnetic uh...

1397
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:48,259
uh... suspended like uh... magnetic
cover or metal be magnetized into that

1398
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:48,770
tape

1399
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:51,100
and now we had actual flexible

1400
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,339
plastic tapes

1401
01:06:52,339 --> 01:06:55,989
and thus flexible prostitutes were
extremely useful

1402
01:06:55,989 --> 01:06:59,850
is it that uh... you could actually have
like a practical reel to reel recorder

1403
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:02,839
where you could have things moving
because they didn't have reel to reel

1404
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,609
like devices for kate's

1405
01:07:04,609 --> 01:07:08,319
uh... still tapes and why reporters test
will be impractical credibly heavy

1406
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:11,230
it bends impressive breaks and it's
really hard for example

1407
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:15,400
to uh... piece back together so to speak
uh... steel wire that's broken

1408
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,859
you know it at the southern

1409
01:07:16,859 --> 01:07:17,969
that works

1410
01:07:17,969 --> 01:07:20,659
uh... and some of the steel tape

1411
01:07:20,659 --> 01:07:24,659
so classic tapes basically changed at
the entire way that uh... series of

1412
01:07:24,659 --> 01:07:26,420
different companies worked

1413
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:30,679
not the least of which was the audio
recording industry

1414
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:33,549
it's it's kind of like and in
interesting

1415
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:37,629
an interesting uh... side note but there
is a chemical peel exit basically made

1416
01:07:37,629 --> 01:07:38,620
it possible

1417
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:39,990
for n_b_c_

1418
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:41,558
to exist

1419
01:07:41,559 --> 01:07:43,210
of ended with it

1420
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:45,499
would allow for entertainers to record

1421
01:07:45,499 --> 01:07:46,488
there

1422
01:07:46,489 --> 01:07:49,449
their particular performance a single
time

1423
01:07:49,449 --> 01:07:50,749
and then play it back

1424
01:07:50,749 --> 01:07:54,868
so the way that it was going for a while
was a series of telephone lines

1425
01:07:54,869 --> 01:07:57,909
there will be one central place where
something was done it would be broadcast

1426
01:07:57,909 --> 01:08:00,859
out and then rebroadcast at the same
time so that meant that you could only

1427
01:08:00,859 --> 01:08:02,720
have one time the nothing was done

1428
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:03,919
and then it was

1429
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,339
it is not just a different time so for
example it's nine o'clock here at eight

1430
01:08:07,339 --> 01:08:08,340
o'clock there

1431
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:10,339
seven o'clock here it's five o'clock
there

1432
01:08:10,339 --> 01:08:13,729
when you have two trillion at that time
it so it's only able to happen in real

1433
01:08:13,729 --> 01:08:14,299
time

1434
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:18,649
and the networks actually wanted to stop
people from reporting this because the

1435
01:08:18,649 --> 01:08:20,138
owned the content

1436
01:08:20,139 --> 01:08:22,999
city what you'd be on the contract

1437
01:08:22,999 --> 01:08:25,510
uh... it was only because of being
crosby

1438
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:27,359
i believe that this change

1439
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:30,310
because basically bing crosby really
didn't like

1440
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:34,839
uh... doing photographic recordings he'd
like to do things like that he also

1441
01:08:34,839 --> 01:08:36,788
can really enjoy the process of

1442
01:08:36,788 --> 01:08:40,049
of of being a photographic record in
sequence field still alive when we want

1443
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:40,538
to do it

1444
01:08:40,538 --> 01:08:41,849
and then allow

1445
01:08:41,849 --> 01:08:44,639
i've got to be rebroadcast at a time
shifted manner

1446
01:08:44,639 --> 01:08:49,159
suki funded impex to build these time
shifting devices magnetic recorders as

1447
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:50,238
we know them today

1448
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:52,309
uh... and they're huge devices

1449
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:53,540
gigantic devices

1450
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:56,278
you know motors that were driving these
things and look like

1451
01:08:56,279 --> 01:08:59,429
feedback meals and stuff to stop the
tapes and so they would have the right

1452
01:08:59,429 --> 01:09:00,519
about attention

1453
01:09:00,519 --> 01:09:02,440
and eventually ampex

1454
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:05,568
uh... basically it affirmatively
producer to go out of business because

1455
01:09:05,569 --> 01:09:09,219
bing crosby had an entire engineering
team that start to build devices and

1456
01:09:09,219 --> 01:09:11,510
used his connections in the show
business industry

1457
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:14,980
in order to make sure that different
studios if they want to have been crosby

1458
01:09:14,979 --> 01:09:16,639
be part of the studios production

1459
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,179
dividing crosby's electronic recording
devices

1460
01:09:20,179 --> 01:09:23,538
imagine that i mean it's like crazy so
there's this like diapers also like

1461
01:09:23,538 --> 01:09:26,528
singing and dancing and then when he
gets off the stage for use like so many

1462
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:32,019
magnetic recording devices that
revolutionized the way to do business

1463
01:09:32,019 --> 01:09:33,679
talk about of modern union

1464
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:35,819
so m

1465
01:09:35,819 --> 01:09:37,540
except of course is videorecording

1466
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:41,288
uh... this as like u

1467
01:09:41,288 --> 01:09:44,528
lee it could be like six hours of talks
in just about like he'll go ahead since

1468
01:09:44,529 --> 01:09:48,319
like different kinds of the new
recording unlike we soon code fields

1469
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:51,679
but basically the first attempts were
black and white video with audio and cut

1470
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:54,210
it and it took three hundred and sixteen
inches

1471
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:55,330
a second

1472
01:09:55,330 --> 01:09:56,750
of bandwidth

1473
01:09:56,750 --> 01:10:00,169
i mean you don't normally measure ben
within inches per second

1474
01:10:00,169 --> 01:10:03,579
uh... probly not when you use a metric
system anywhere but let's pretend for a

1475
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:06,999
second uh... inches make sense uh... and

1476
01:10:06,999 --> 01:10:09,480
three hundred and six inches per second
it's quite a while

1477
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:13,650
um... and it's also uh... pretty
incredible to think that there's

1478
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:15,888
actually you go to record this video
stuff

1479
01:10:15,889 --> 01:10:19,689
but it required a lot of uh... like
several actual different

1480
01:10:19,689 --> 01:10:21,099
you required uh...

1481
01:10:21,099 --> 01:10:25,169
more benefit even was available time
with just a simple stray analog records

1482
01:10:25,169 --> 01:10:29,519
that have come up with new techniques

1483
01:10:29,519 --> 01:10:32,130
under recording mastering

1484
01:10:32,130 --> 01:10:36,110
is basically the thing that i find to be
in wes anderson about the early days

1485
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:38,339
mostly because the video recorded stuff

1486
01:10:38,339 --> 01:10:39,349
uh...

1487
01:10:39,349 --> 01:10:41,959
because it does not really so
interesting to me i guess

1488
01:10:41,959 --> 01:10:44,929
uh... audio recording is the most of his
life

1489
01:10:44,929 --> 01:10:47,370
what we see today with maj trips

1490
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:49,340
and that's the thing that i think it's
work

1491
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:51,110
you probably actually care about

1492
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:54,059
uh... so sorry for born usb uh...

1493
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:56,619
my love for his creative but

1494
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:59,929
for scary and his lovely wife

1495
01:10:59,929 --> 01:11:03,360
basically solve one of the outstanding
problems that i_b_m_ had which is that

1496
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,268
they knew that if they had in the next
right

1497
01:11:05,269 --> 01:11:08,140
it could be applied in a way to a card
of some sort

1498
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:10,900
then people would be able to carry
around managements in a way to look into

1499
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:14,089
their wallets or into their personal be
useful

1500
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:18,659
so she basically took these magnetic
afield strips writes like this is an

1501
01:11:18,659 --> 01:11:19,869
audio

1502
01:11:19,869 --> 01:11:21,759
saying mike

1503
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,579
maybe slighted if we could attach it to
a party gets a big blue

1504
01:11:24,579 --> 01:11:28,619
and good news on the straight and it's
like one p and doesn't work

1505
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:32,099
answer yes this is a plastic like
substance that has this magnetic

1506
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:32,840
uh...

1507
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:37,030
uh... this payment encoding but you just
can't get it on the car

1508
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:39,059
he told his wife this one day

1509
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:42,260
and his wife said uh... what we
discussed flatiron

1510
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:45,389
and so well she's a hiring insurance
presumably

1511
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:47,040
he brings over

1512
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,189
the card and a straight

1513
01:11:49,189 --> 01:11:51,090
and then she owns it

1514
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:54,879
and turns out that if used perfectly
with the plastic heart

1515
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:59,239
and his wife together had invented but
simple developed by i_b_m_

1516
01:11:59,239 --> 01:12:00,379
had invented

1517
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:02,140
the magnetic stripe

1518
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:04,850
the car that we all used today is an
accident

1519
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:06,260
basically

1520
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:10,719
so coming tuesday nineteen sixty

1521
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:14,030
he also forest areas like the other guy
right

1522
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:15,739
uh... overland sniffing

1523
01:12:15,739 --> 01:12:18,159
blood miracles and are both totally
awesome

1524
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:21,308
uh... they have been long dead at this
point and force perry

1525
01:12:21,309 --> 01:12:24,750
was working in ibm working on all sorts
of other cool technology so if you've

1526
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,219
ever seen a u_p_c_

1527
01:12:26,219 --> 01:12:30,030
uh... if you've ever used optical
character recognition systems problem

1528
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:31,900
post systems in a lot of countries

1529
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,870
if it was invalids by i_b_m_

1530
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:36,449
it's probably because of course perry
worked on it and

1531
01:12:36,449 --> 01:12:40,019
uh... he seems like a pretty anderson
guy who worked on a lot of technology

1532
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:40,650
heat pumps

1533
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:42,808
owns a attacker but i think it was

1534
01:12:42,809 --> 01:12:45,729
uh... even before the m_i_t_ remedies so

1535
01:12:45,729 --> 01:12:46,770
is a very

1536
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:48,080
he's a very long

1537
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,630
uh... on a kind of guy and traditional
i_b_m_ circles

1538
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:58,169
uh... spent the very first use this was
for u_s_ government systems

1539
01:12:58,169 --> 01:13:01,709
so one thing that's worth understanding
laments rex is this unit of measurement

1540
01:13:01,709 --> 01:13:02,769
of the or shot

1541
01:13:02,770 --> 01:13:05,940
uh... which is basically

1542
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:08,530
it's it's essentially the way that you
can measure the strength of a magnetic

1543
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:09,250
field

1544
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:11,530
over a given area of space

1545
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:13,150
so they were celebrating

1546
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:18,000
is most commonly talked about in regards
to credit cards are magnetic stripes as

1547
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,489
heights overlooking

1548
01:13:19,489 --> 01:13:23,089
so if you look at uh... loco card you'll
see that the cartwright the string of

1549
01:13:23,089 --> 01:13:26,110
bad and i have a bhagya cards and sample

1550
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:30,358
uh... some are great stuff which i can
show after this cock

1551
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:32,080
basically those ones are brown

1552
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:35,659
and letter brown ones are about three
hundred or shots or so

1553
01:13:35,659 --> 01:13:40,000
and the like the ones which if you look
it if you'll be in walletpop bankcard

1554
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,100
it's probably black hole you may have to
be in

1555
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:45,120
connected to the pen in europe
straightening

1556
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,289
revelations in the twenty-first century

1557
01:13:48,289 --> 01:13:51,889
the local ones are often like thirteen
point it's been magnetized through metal

1558
01:13:51,889 --> 01:13:53,940
closed and many times in some way

1559
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:56,699
uh... or it's like a slur reabsorption

1560
01:13:56,699 --> 01:13:58,049
it's been once were

1561
01:13:58,050 --> 01:13:59,170
we basically just

1562
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:00,900
layered into the paper process

1563
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:03,799
and those are no basically

1564
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,170
just like small

1565
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:07,170
small areas of states that you can

1566
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:11,440
passes field over and when you change
the field you sexually revoking shifter

1567
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,290
ships the magnetic field that's included
in the actual

1568
01:14:14,290 --> 01:14:15,709
uh... card itself

1569
01:14:15,709 --> 01:14:18,030
uh... most people have come heiko cards

1570
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:19,980
this is really only matters

1571
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:21,019
if u

1572
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:22,060
are trying

1573
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:25,710
uh... to do reason reggie cheap
hardworking basically if you want to

1574
01:14:25,710 --> 01:14:26,500
used car

1575
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:29,390
readers cannot tell the difference in or
chat rating

1576
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:33,190
if the seat of your busy they feel to
feed into the field with up to the field

1577
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:37,969
uh... but if you try to for example
change the field of a high-profile loco

1578
01:14:37,969 --> 01:14:41,439
rita records not work out for you

1579
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:43,499
uh... basically i_b_m_

1580
01:14:43,499 --> 01:14:45,670
that they would really need to come up
with

1581
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:47,489
uh... series of

1582
01:14:47,489 --> 01:14:48,549
uh... standards

1583
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:52,870
because the only way that this is going
to be practical or his going to work

1584
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:56,059
is that people adopted not only their
hardware but they were able to properly

1585
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:57,699
with it

1586
01:14:57,699 --> 01:14:59,438
essentially

1587
01:14:59,439 --> 01:15:01,590
the uh... magnetic stripe

1588
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:05,369
standards uh... a series of eyes so
documents

1589
01:15:05,369 --> 01:15:10,290
and as i said documents will allow you
to did you have to actual finally here

1590
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:11,199
but basically

1591
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:14,489
and you have um... fields that change
over time

1592
01:15:14,489 --> 01:15:16,150
right the one st of the car

1593
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:18,009
is the thing that is going to change

1594
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:22,600
and do you have buckets and the buckets
of basically allow u to uh...

1595
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:25,889
recalculations about what we're going to
call included it

1596
01:15:25,889 --> 01:15:27,069
uh... and

1597
01:15:27,069 --> 01:15:31,059
basically you can separate uh... a
single track into multiple traps or one

1598
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:34,629
strike into multiple sections and i said
you know talks about that and put all

1599
01:15:34,629 --> 01:15:37,719
those details of because you can just
reference the documents

1600
01:15:37,719 --> 01:15:42,079
uh... but basically in short u_s_a_
standards that need eleven two seventy

1601
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:44,739
eight thirteen basically talk about the
field

1602
01:15:44,739 --> 01:15:48,869
uh... like actual strength they talk
about uh... the physical characteristics

1603
01:15:48,869 --> 01:15:51,960
of the carton the placement of the
stratton and they also talk about

1604
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,489
the different current any different
tracks

1605
01:15:54,489 --> 01:15:57,629
in terms of bits per inch but also in
terms of characters and how you can

1606
01:15:57,630 --> 01:16:02,039
teach excellence make sure you can read
the filer correctly

1607
01:16:02,039 --> 01:16:08,070
and i have some hardware

1608
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:10,058
people want to see the phone

1609
01:16:10,059 --> 01:16:12,780
that's the answer to six since the uh...
need standard

1610
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:14,269
for reading and writing

1611
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:16,730
and this is not interface which is
pretty expensive

1612
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:18,360
and this is the word

1613
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:20,509
time which is pretty useful

1614
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:24,179
so that you can use the ama searchers
six it does rob reading and writing

1615
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:27,599
we'll talk about the sec mac interface
does robbery here already

1616
01:16:27,599 --> 01:16:28,870
the mac uh...

1617
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:30,630
macular faces only locals

1618
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:32,119
this was also heiko

1619
01:16:32,119 --> 01:16:34,259
so you can do a lot of close-up of that

1620
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:38,989
uh... you can also use an audio cable
and an actual red-haired from say like a

1621
01:16:38,989 --> 01:16:39,860
key player

1622
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:41,120
and then using that

1623
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:43,110
you are able to basically

1624
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:43,719
uh... re

1625
01:16:43,719 --> 01:16:47,280
the actual raw data and then you can do
the calculations and if you can measure

1626
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,400
um... the the the time of the slight and
of course you can start to do the

1627
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,379
calculations for the l r c

1628
01:16:52,379 --> 01:16:53,969
and you can actually look at some other
stuff

1629
01:16:53,969 --> 01:16:56,030
and that's good for reading

1630
01:16:56,030 --> 01:16:59,360
i wanted to do something a little bit
different and i couldn't actually come

1631
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:02,190
up with a really good idea for how to do
playback

1632
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:06,669
uh... and polishing and was a visiting
hacker at northridge uh... came and he

1633
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:09,909
said why this idea for this device i was
like oh yeah that's the licking

1634
01:17:09,909 --> 01:17:13,820
emulating device reappeared something a
great idea

1635
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:18,580
can i talk to mister w daniel invested
connection figure out like how-to

1636
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:19,570
returning it later

1637
01:17:19,570 --> 01:17:23,120
antony she built a circuit we what we've
got some of the stuff together but

1638
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,880
basically he built the circuit that

1639
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:28,100
we haven't quite finished but it takes
the audio output of a lot for

1640
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:31,660
and or are not part of something and you
press play on the device and it seems

1641
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:34,470
that through the hardware and then the
hardware actually plays back by shifting

1642
01:17:34,470 --> 01:17:35,709
the field

1643
01:17:35,709 --> 01:17:37,949
uh... who used to t_c_i_ riser

1644
01:17:37,949 --> 01:17:40,799
do not on the visa metal

1645
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,179
but useful if you want of a similar
devices you can also grab

1646
01:17:44,179 --> 01:17:48,179
uh... mechanical dr magnetic strip
rewrite ur and election of the car back

1647
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:49,300
and forth for you

1648
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:50,239
uh... so

1649
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:51,159
we

1650
01:17:51,159 --> 01:17:54,420
as and some people in this pitch myself
help all of a couple of other

1651
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,310
contributors

1652
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:58,349
wrote this thing called live in a star
which comes in a series of utilities

1653
01:17:58,349 --> 01:18:01,959
and then you can grab it from the
minnesota google co dot com

1654
01:18:01,959 --> 01:18:05,550
and i live emissaries basically magnetic
stripe reading in the spirit of

1655
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:07,360
continues not unit

1656
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:10,860
uh... so we want to be able to get the
broader actual file a writ data

1657
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:14,230
we also want to make sure that we have
used to do as a reading and writing

1658
01:18:14,230 --> 01:18:15,049
uh... and

1659
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:17,760
we want it should we support a lot of
common hardware and we ought to be able

1660
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:21,300
to read modify in recorded history i
wanted to just happened in the device to

1661
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,530
be cool if we can also happen invites

1662
01:18:23,530 --> 01:18:24,870
uh... and

1663
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:27,519
uh... part of the reason that we want to
ensure we have sparked from opal

1664
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,239
multiple devices to make sure that we
actually can confirm that our

1665
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,678
implementation works properly we did
that

1666
01:18:32,679 --> 01:18:36,329
so we have support full support for the
researchers six because it's actually

1667
01:18:36,329 --> 01:18:37,790
open unspecified

1668
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:42,320
bob this is uh... about a six enters
u_s_ dollar version of the device

1669
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:45,299
is pretty good and you get it from

1670
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:48,739
and what you have that basically don't
mean anything out acceptance large so if

1671
01:18:48,739 --> 01:18:51,678
you're just sitting in office works
perfectly but if you wanna be able to

1672
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:53,469
take on an airplane and read your life

1673
01:18:53,469 --> 01:18:56,280
plane ticket before you get on the
airplane and that's not really going to

1674
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,440
work so well unless you bust out here

1675
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:02,219
power strip and sat there at the
computer

1676
01:19:02,219 --> 01:19:06,069
uh... we but it's not replace and
speaking with some software that i don't

1677
01:19:06,069 --> 01:19:08,870
like non-free software so by

1678
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:10,530
basically reverse engineered and

1679
01:19:10,530 --> 01:19:12,789
by sniffing he hates the boss

1680
01:19:12,789 --> 01:19:16,179
and that use a proprietary software and
took very careful notes while using a

1681
01:19:16,179 --> 01:19:17,199
and driving it

1682
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:20,049
and uh... i was able to actually come up
with the specification

1683
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:21,650
and that specifications

1684
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:24,620
uh... will allow you to drive this
device entirely with restocked where

1685
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:29,090
found so i wrote the specification up my
publishes online so you can use the

1686
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:30,280
specification

1687
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:33,519
to return implementation of the confirm
the report properly

1688
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,310
uh... then after i did this

1689
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:36,840
i got a letter from max right

1690
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:39,249
nor the backing of his people who said

1691
01:19:39,249 --> 01:19:40,919
you on a specification

1692
01:19:40,919 --> 01:19:43,939
yet we were on vacation when you ask
about that

1693
01:19:43,939 --> 01:19:49,849
yeah sure look at that rate ever to good
job

1694
01:19:49,849 --> 01:19:51,170
side of the location

1695
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:54,730
the thing is that they still have
incentive so um... put the dealers

1696
01:19:54,730 --> 01:19:56,209
uh... the best interest that standard

1697
01:19:56,209 --> 01:19:59,580
uh... wrote uh... pretty cool set of
programs

1698
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:03,620
dated integrated partially into a better
start you if u if you check out the rest

1699
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:05,440
are you get these programs and it's

1700
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,919
slowly but surely being integrated into
like a common interface

1701
01:20:08,919 --> 01:20:12,919
from the basically the idea is that use
this microphone uh... as uh... any input

1702
01:20:12,919 --> 01:20:15,869
device or microphone jack on your
computer as a method of icici swipe the

1703
01:20:15,869 --> 01:20:16,809
card and then

1704
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:19,719
like as the field shift its included

1705
01:20:19,719 --> 01:20:22,040
by the actual optical signals which of
course

1706
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:26,210
if you look at in how do you invite
ceremony that divisive basically an

1707
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:27,810
analog-to-digital converter

1708
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:30,420
don't think your laptops and you can use
your a_d_d_

1709
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:33,550
uh... and you can now look at the
stricken at that somebody

1710
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:36,680
approval to decode the format of the new
york rhetoric are cheating um...

1711
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:40,200
microphone soaring to add that's parties
who have support for basically these

1712
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:41,190
three devices

1713
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:42,928
and using mystery devices you should

1714
01:20:42,929 --> 01:20:45,890
basically be able to do any kind of
analysis you want to be able to change

1715
01:20:45,890 --> 01:20:50,550
anything that you want and should be
able to do some other stuff

1716
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:51,850
here's a quick analysis

1717
01:20:51,850 --> 01:20:54,049
the almost last thing here

1718
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:54,959
basically

1719
01:20:54,959 --> 01:20:58,629
you get the car do you wanna target it
does not be part of the anything

1720
01:20:58,629 --> 01:21:02,150
you can do all sorts of crazy stuff like
you can try to like iron it off

1721
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:06,170
onto another surface that's like a
common technique that people try to do

1722
01:21:06,170 --> 01:21:08,580
but basically you'll have a strike

1723
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:11,350
and what are you something like this

1724
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:14,659
this is arthur fluid viewers

1725
01:21:14,659 --> 01:21:16,820
you can also get its parade

1726
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:19,398
but basically the idea behind this
device is a very

1727
01:21:19,399 --> 01:21:22,889
very small piece of plastic with uh...
cold metal back

1728
01:21:22,889 --> 01:21:24,280
it rained

1729
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:26,410
there's a affair for them back

1730
01:21:26,410 --> 01:21:28,608
which is just brown substance that's
moving around

1731
01:21:28,609 --> 01:21:31,380
he basically just set it directly on top
of a car

1732
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:34,320
and you can see the magnetic field

1733
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,130
with your own eyes

1734
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:39,550
so if you build a large enough one of
these you can actually put it across the

1735
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:40,520
entire car

1736
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:43,439
and scanner instead of a scanner

1737
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:47,969
and that you could do basically optical
field recognition

1738
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:49,790
if you want it

1739
01:21:49,790 --> 01:21:52,960
this would be useful for example if you
want to confirm that your implementation

1740
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,449
actually works properly

1741
01:21:54,449 --> 01:21:56,629
uh... we've actually done that

1742
01:21:56,630 --> 01:22:00,230
it seems like it's kind of a lot of work
for doing something where know that we

1743
01:22:00,230 --> 01:22:01,379
did correctly

1744
01:22:01,379 --> 01:22:04,940
um... but for some cards formats might
be necessary

1745
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:06,790
to read the cards in that way

1746
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:10,729
until you find out the reading though i
don't know probably not

1747
01:22:10,729 --> 01:22:13,059
basically you prepare the software

1748
01:22:13,059 --> 01:22:16,379
you recorded it multiple times to ensure
that you actually have the regarded as a

1749
01:22:16,379 --> 01:22:17,800
proprietary formats

1750
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,269
you might not have the same checks out

1751
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:21,599
you might not have an artsy

1752
01:22:21,599 --> 01:22:24,289
so it could be the case that they
included and said we don't care if we

1753
01:22:24,289 --> 01:22:27,530
get it but it right persons with
multiple times works for a stop someone

1754
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:29,040
from figuring out the filing of

1755
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,900
file it level and coding

1756
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:34,228
so that's the point of dancing signaled
office

1757
01:22:34,229 --> 01:22:39,099
this is the viewing fluid at this frog
luggage cfc one forty one p

1758
01:22:39,099 --> 01:22:40,690
which you can buy pain

1759
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:43,919
packs of six these people do cardio
analysis so

1760
01:22:43,919 --> 01:22:46,969
over the business to this quite
successful for a while

1761
01:22:46,969 --> 01:22:50,499
which worked in their favor until people
stop using tapes

1762
01:22:50,499 --> 01:22:53,469
olemiss dot these intensive and they
started to go down a little bit

1763
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:55,179
they're really cool magnetics company

1764
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:58,760
but largely the worked with audio stuff
says audio stuff is gone the way of the

1765
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:00,790
dodo in terms of metrics

1766
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:03,039
or magnetic fields and and tapes in
general

1767
01:23:03,039 --> 01:23:06,769
um... they had stopped makes us you can
really by and six cents pretty expensive

1768
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:10,940
i think it's like thirty or more dollars
per can and they are very friendly and

1769
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:14,339
you can reply from them and if you do
you have to use it think of a fax

1770
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:16,129
machine

1771
01:23:16,129 --> 01:23:18,999
i'm sure is so you've heard of this and
agree to devise its like a really you

1772
01:23:18,999 --> 01:23:19,530
know

1773
01:23:19,530 --> 01:23:22,639
but essentially it's not actually is
efficient and it's

1774
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:24,900
probably even less secure

1775
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:29,089
uh... tailored you can kind of see the
light area on that strip

1776
01:23:29,090 --> 01:23:30,730
you see that

1777
01:23:30,730 --> 01:23:37,730
they hear

1778
01:23:38,150 --> 01:23:40,959
spine returns

1779
01:23:40,959 --> 01:23:47,959
not

1780
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:51,860
because i want you to do you

1781
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,809
you see the car

1782
01:23:53,810 --> 01:23:55,229
but your own eyes

1783
01:23:55,229 --> 01:23:57,899
and you can now tell if it's
perpendicular to the strike or if

1784
01:23:57,899 --> 01:23:59,369
there's a particular angle

1785
01:23:59,369 --> 01:24:01,150
so is the hotel carton

1786
01:24:01,150 --> 01:24:08,150
and what i think you'll notice the card

1787
01:24:19,309 --> 01:24:22,139
we talk about the physical
characteristics of the mexican workers

1788
01:24:22,139 --> 01:24:25,780
and so forth and you can actually
measure that now that you can see it

1789
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:27,469
so that's kind of useful

1790
01:24:27,469 --> 01:24:30,329
does the portable viewer the arnold
magnetically or

1791
01:24:30,329 --> 01:24:35,650
uh... model b warner to do or something
like that

1792
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:36,598
this is great

1793
01:24:36,599 --> 01:24:39,179
under a hundred u_s_ dollars you should
buy one

1794
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:43,170
invalid unless our uh... regal i wrote
up uh... uh... wrote a poem basically

1795
01:24:43,170 --> 01:24:45,459
are huge write-up about like an
introduction to me

1796
01:24:45,459 --> 01:24:48,479
and that took place then we too much
time thinking about that stuff

1797
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:49,899
uh... and

1798
01:24:49,899 --> 01:24:52,979
i found that there is that this huge
collection of stuff on the internet

1799
01:24:52,979 --> 01:24:56,749
and all that basically just

1800
01:24:56,749 --> 01:24:58,510
basically

1801
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:01,750
pair phrases some well known things
about the eyes of standard at a very

1802
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,239
high level like

1803
01:25:03,239 --> 01:25:06,089
yes the first character is a percent

1804
01:25:06,090 --> 01:25:08,440
and then you get from last year after
words

1805
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:12,339
that's not really that useful because
i've personally don't care what the deal

1806
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:15,280
is posting cut as i actually care but
the physical layer so that i can

1807
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,880
understand the different ways that's
offer might interpret it special in

1808
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:20,659
writing custom software to interpret it

1809
01:25:20,659 --> 01:25:24,138
so if you read every defile you
basically will get all of this and then

1810
01:25:24,139 --> 01:25:28,929
some with lots of references or and
there's an incredible

1811
01:25:28,929 --> 01:25:31,659
they recommend reading it's called
magnetic recording the first hundred

1812
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:32,388
years

1813
01:25:32,389 --> 01:25:36,989
it's by tripoli um... and it was
published in the late nineties so it's

1814
01:25:36,989 --> 01:25:38,308
missing some stuff

1815
01:25:38,309 --> 01:25:41,449
uh... and doesn't actually talk about
credit cards are going to try to leave

1816
01:25:41,449 --> 01:25:42,638
at all

1817
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:44,999
it mostly talks but the physics of
magnetics

1818
01:25:44,999 --> 01:25:48,980
he talks about mathematics behind it it
talks about different pieces of hardware

1819
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:52,769
and historical evolution of magnetic
strips and magnetic fields

1820
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:56,440
so this book is like bitterly the best
book ever written about magnetics and it

1821
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:57,849
goes into hard drives

1822
01:25:57,850 --> 01:26:01,110
and other stuff and from that meeting
and with as i said standards and with a

1823
01:26:01,110 --> 01:26:02,598
little bit about some of us are

1824
01:26:02,599 --> 01:26:05,690
he should basically be able to drive
everything you need to know about

1825
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:08,480
magnetic strips it's like he comes to
you

1826
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,409
as a result of knowing that stuff misses
like

1827
01:26:10,409 --> 01:26:13,339
propose best book ever on that subject

1828
01:26:13,339 --> 01:26:15,689
that's what the magnetic viewer will
show you

1829
01:26:15,689 --> 01:26:17,119
when you use it on the strike

1830
01:26:17,119 --> 01:26:21,799
this is on a particular proprietary
spread faulty part system for the bay

1831
01:26:21,799 --> 01:26:25,780
area rapid transit system in seven cisco

1832
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:27,469
haven't really done very much for that

1833
01:26:27,469 --> 01:26:29,409
but i want to look at it because

1834
01:26:29,409 --> 01:26:32,059
as a security feature before people

1835
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:34,280
angle the strike

1836
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:37,679
right because you can't use this in a
normal reader

1837
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:43,089
uh... it expects the field to be written
perpendicular to the washington stripe

1838
01:26:43,089 --> 01:26:47,079
as the strike goes through it's going to
have airs

1839
01:26:47,079 --> 01:26:49,909
it's going to read i feel that it's
going to basically average between

1840
01:26:49,909 --> 01:26:53,299
multiple areas on the contract and i
would be wrong

1841
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:55,469
so what that means is that we could do
you are

1842
01:26:55,469 --> 01:26:58,780
and uh... essentially uh...

1843
01:26:58,780 --> 01:26:59,940
a piece of paper

1844
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:03,419
you can figure out the angle of the
strike and now you can build

1845
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:07,070
uh... custom piece of hardware or you
can use a sham that will allow you to

1846
01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:10,639
make sure that when you strike the car
wings but the car

1847
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:14,479
that you're actually being read at the
proper angle for the card

1848
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:15,590
and that's

1849
01:27:15,590 --> 01:27:18,489
really super useful and so one of the
future things that northridge is going

1850
01:27:18,489 --> 01:27:21,250
to produce probably i will be the one to
make this

1851
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:24,739
we want to build a magnetic strip read a
writer dick if you would like to and

1852
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:26,290
local reading and writing

1853
01:27:26,290 --> 01:27:28,619
i have so far matador raw formatted

1854
01:27:28,619 --> 01:27:32,949
and really all that means is that the i
assume format is done by the hardware

1855
01:27:32,949 --> 01:27:34,400
this device for example

1856
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,120
foley goes wrong

1857
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,139
and then if they do all of the eyes of
the checking

1858
01:27:38,139 --> 01:27:40,070
and software which is great innes

1859
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:43,360
if you get free software can be a tree
suffer exactly crap but i don't like

1860
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,769
that

1861
01:27:44,770 --> 01:27:47,989
uh... if they give a suspect and will
finish implementing it i guess who was

1862
01:27:47,989 --> 01:27:49,820
in my district continue her singing

1863
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:50,750
they weren't so

1864
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:53,519
will also have been the reader affair
flew device

1865
01:27:53,519 --> 01:27:55,110
and it will allow you to

1866
01:27:55,110 --> 01:27:57,849
if the design works out we have to have
the fat

1867
01:27:57,850 --> 01:28:00,900
basically the idea will be you'll have
this reader and you'll be able to put

1868
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:04,669
the cart win uh... when you slide the
party and to be able to see

1869
01:28:04,669 --> 01:28:07,269
you repair the angle of the strike

1870
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:08,610
and then tune

1871
01:28:08,610 --> 01:28:11,670
the actual read and write at incall

1872
01:28:11,670 --> 01:28:15,369
that you see teasing week make the
devices actually self calibrate

1873
01:28:15,369 --> 01:28:18,889
for the prior to reformat the expect
without having to use a sham

1874
01:28:18,889 --> 01:28:22,489
and you get this for free you dream draw
support and we'll all be done with free

1875
01:28:22,489 --> 01:28:25,728
software uh... lessons and the bsd
license

1876
01:28:25,729 --> 01:28:28,489
uh... such a teacher work they were
going to work on and i think what to do

1877
01:28:28,489 --> 01:28:31,159
that it'll pretty much be a case that
anybody can do anything with max

1878
01:28:31,159 --> 01:28:33,610
transfer that using any proprietary
software

1879
01:28:33,610 --> 01:28:36,070
and really being able to understand it
from the actual

1880
01:28:36,070 --> 01:28:39,449
uh... physical characteristics of a
magnetic

1881
01:28:39,449 --> 01:28:43,909
to actual interpreted dated is
meaningful to humans and computers

1882
01:28:43,909 --> 01:28:46,648
uh... this is an honest i put it out

1883
01:28:46,649 --> 01:28:47,539
uh... inr

1884
01:28:47,539 --> 01:28:51,110
which is also at the field we needed to
like rap a lot of wire around in this is

1885
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:52,389
the inside

1886
01:28:52,389 --> 01:28:57,000
i flew with this you believe that

1887
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,110
that in a carry-on luggage

1888
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:02,250
uh... and the security guard asked me
what it was a nice that you can impeach

1889
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:03,380
require

1890
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:10,030
a

1891
01:29:10,030 --> 01:29:14,909
technically that's a lot

1892
01:29:14,909 --> 01:29:15,870
more like

1893
01:29:15,870 --> 01:29:17,989
a stereo well amano

1894
01:29:17,989 --> 01:29:20,218
and be free output filter

1895
01:29:20,219 --> 01:29:23,500
uh... but basically you plug that into
your ipod and you plus

1896
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,060
depressed play

1897
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:26,119
and uh...

1898
01:29:26,119 --> 01:29:27,759
you're going to go

1899
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,920
and you just basically stick the p_c_r_
riser sheehan

1900
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:33,199
in front of the rehab

1901
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:36,858
time is a thing that changes instead of
the rehab so you don't have to swipe the

1902
01:29:36,859 --> 01:29:38,110
card a bunch of times

1903
01:29:38,110 --> 01:29:39,648
you could sit there and fun

1904
01:29:39,649 --> 01:29:42,460
and you could have a list of all the
possible access card numbers

1905
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:46,010
and you could literally just press play
i don't dispute trip eventually it or

1906
01:29:46,010 --> 01:29:50,159
republican

1907
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:54,688
i thought i was sold badass having built
this way publishing them in order to

1908
01:29:54,689 --> 01:29:56,639
reelect yeah that's great

1909
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:58,159
are so i'll select

1910
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:01,169
process also about it but it's only one
track

1911
01:30:01,169 --> 01:30:06,090
uh... well maybe people only have one to
that

1912
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:07,540
letter what black hat

1913
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:09,889
and i ran into major malfunction

1914
01:30:09,889 --> 01:30:14,320
and i was telling you about some of
stuff i was working on

1915
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:15,728
and being out of

1916
01:30:15,729 --> 01:30:18,320
physical you might be interested in this
device

1917
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,219
and uh...

1918
01:30:20,219 --> 01:30:21,190
he pulls out

1919
01:30:21,190 --> 01:30:25,138
small piece of plastic altitude uh...
it's basically the same size in critical

1920
01:30:25,139 --> 01:30:28,219
but it's clear and hence require else

1921
01:30:28,219 --> 01:30:29,709
at the area where the strikers

1922
01:30:29,709 --> 01:30:31,579
conflict mother fucker

1923
01:30:31,579 --> 01:30:33,139
you build it

1924
01:30:33,139 --> 01:30:34,260
and sure enough

1925
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:37,309
it's a small cable going from the three
coils

1926
01:30:37,309 --> 01:30:40,700
into a circuit court of on the circuit
board you can clearly see

1927
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:43,039
that he has design something where you
can

1928
01:30:43,039 --> 01:30:48,480
program optics and the people drive the
three separate uh... the the three

1929
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,320
separate

1930
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:51,280
fields

1931
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,599
in a in a smart weight so you can
literally

1932
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,820
playback revealed at the same time

1933
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:57,210
by deceiving apart

1934
01:30:57,210 --> 01:30:59,219
directly in it but that's beside the
paper

1935
01:30:59,219 --> 01:31:01,289
the only way that you could make it
better is if you could put the entire

1936
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:03,089
going into a single credit card

1937
01:31:03,089 --> 01:31:03,879
and of course

1938
01:31:03,879 --> 01:31:07,809
this works it's a little bit differently
and that you play to an audio device

1939
01:31:07,809 --> 01:31:09,020
which i think it's kind of ice

1940
01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:12,870
so i think you could probly modify his
device to play from an audio device

1941
01:31:12,870 --> 01:31:14,989
instead of from uh... a pic unit

1942
01:31:14,989 --> 01:31:17,980
doesn't seem like a big heart the hard
part was actually figuring out how to a

1943
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:22,079
like in bed the quayles in them how to
drive the quilt so once you got back

1944
01:31:22,079 --> 01:31:25,259
then you have the same amazing about so
the future future work

1945
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:26,870
for any leading the cards

1946
01:31:26,870 --> 01:31:29,979
on the other side of having the reader
writer is of course happen like

1947
01:31:29,979 --> 01:31:32,499
that emulator has done that and totally

1948
01:31:32,499 --> 01:31:34,309
smite you know

1949
01:31:34,309 --> 01:31:35,900
um...

1950
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:37,710
resigned my copy of my

1951
01:31:37,710 --> 01:31:42,309
this personally as well

1952
01:31:42,309 --> 01:31:43,420
anyway

1953
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:49,179
so they're set

1954
01:31:49,179 --> 01:31:52,480
so that that and i'd like to take my
lawyer again for granted for keeping me

1955
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:53,290
out of jail

1956
01:31:53,290 --> 01:31:54,760
uh... because

1957
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:58,800
uh... police with the parking meter
stuff she really

1958
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:01,739
she really gave us really device and she

1959
01:32:01,739 --> 01:32:04,818
probably did tickets out of jail
unseated by sydney for all the research

1960
01:32:04,819 --> 01:32:05,710
that i do

1961
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:06,930
basically prabha

1962
01:32:06,930 --> 01:32:10,210
i mean i donate money to be a theft but
it doesn't even cover an hour of her

1963
01:32:10,210 --> 01:32:10,849
time

1964
01:32:10,849 --> 01:32:14,879
so it's pretty great to have her the
bethel pretty much anybody when they're

1965
01:32:14,879 --> 01:32:16,290
working on good stuff

1966
01:32:16,290 --> 01:32:19,690
uh... so it's worth looking at it and
also thanks to you guys for having me

1967
01:32:19,690 --> 01:32:25,678
places like quite long probably lonestar
in front of the deborah kerr so

1968
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:27,010
if you have questions

1969
01:32:27,010 --> 01:32:34,010
cooper desperate

1970
01:32:36,769 --> 01:32:39,869
all right thank you very much uh... of
course now i don't think we have much

1971
01:32:39,869 --> 01:32:42,630
time organizers and i think the next

1972
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:44,209
talk is about that

1973
01:32:44,209 --> 01:32:45,249
weapons or something

1974
01:32:45,249 --> 01:32:46,659
all right

1975
01:32:46,659 --> 01:32:48,259
summit breakthrough law

1976
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:50,280
we're going to try to tell you is there
any

1977
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:53,239
we've got about one or two questions for
the audience maybe

1978
01:32:53,239 --> 01:32:56,269
there's anything

1979
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:58,619
that's why i want to start up presser
session because

1980
01:32:58,619 --> 01:33:00,739
you people never ask questions of the
list

1981
01:33:00,739 --> 01:33:03,289
alright i think we can set up

1982
01:33:03,289 --> 01:33:05,670
some of your stuff so that people come
up that it

1983
01:33:05,670 --> 01:33:07,999
and i a squadron

1984
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:10,478
named as the other part right

1985
01:33:10,479 --> 01:33:15,789
eluded to uh... small uh... cute they
interview with jackson yeah in the room

1986
01:33:15,789 --> 01:33:17,860
during that session to just you know

1987
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:21,469
in fact that i don't think that what i
have been missing these too

1988
01:33:21,469 --> 01:33:24,649
well sulfide to break everyone and

1989
01:33:24,649 --> 01:33:26,179
you got

1990
01:33:26,179 --> 01:33:28,679
on a ten minute break down

1991
01:33:28,679 --> 01:33:31,739
expected back in set
