1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,420
okay

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,459
prostitute so starts talking exp cap
uh...

3
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:11,979
it's got to his own introduction uh...
advice here

4
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:18,979
so these well-connected

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,599
differently

6
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:25,279
yeah how i was speaking about the
security posture far prettier critical

7
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,060
infrastructure

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,709
something that's scary

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,669
and their jagadics

10
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:32,058
so uh...

11
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:35,129
as all is said menendez who can be
reached

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,470
i work at company called symphonic

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,280
well i'm a softer architect and software
developer

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,610
we do not mean that insistence

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:50,030
uh... actually brought one device that
we develop together with their children

16
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,350
it's this one

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,070
glossy lips tom

18
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,800
it's called eric some

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,059
nobody problem doctor

20
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,060
and uh... i'll go abroad and robert s

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,690
quite cool drink uh... and before i go
to disrupt concerns

22
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,200
missing part of the government will form

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,350
but have been here

24
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,330
and

25
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,399
holding up

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,730
this means that this was not connected
to the three g network

27
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,120
so it's got

28
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,390
uh...

29
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,960
reducing u

30
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,460
the signal strength on the stock or
strikers votes

31
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,869
attitude not phone signal strength in
here

32
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,010
and the point of this is that it also
has wifi

33
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,669
impacts us wifi access point which means
that if you guys look for

34
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:37,679
something called india or mission

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,250
network with as deciding in new york

36
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,990
sistemas

37
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,000
right so if you're much to connect to
that network you live to serve through

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
my personal

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,170
internet connection

40
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,110
i'm not going to come to the keys i
don't have been account for its own

41
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:01,730
uh... they're all support diflucan
excerpts and so we can meet critically

42
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,549
from cable of course

43
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:06,470
and something area like this that

44
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,209
it's gotten used to court

45
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:12,859
to our meeting about the device like
this allegedly used the the box right

46
00:02:12,859 --> 00:02:15,839
but this one actually are expected to
use the host

47
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:18,159
means you can connect uh...

48
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,289
storage like used a memory or

49
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:22,410
at this

50
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,418
and issues before chemical ultimately
shape on the network

51
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:30,219
so in the usa business in the critical
alone

52
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:32,680
when the wind research and no one's s

53
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,719
file into shelling and

54
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:40,129
unix keeps her meaning speaks you know
it's bikes on bob

55
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:43,179
you really didn't answer your

56
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:45,409
used the memory to me

57
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:46,989
metrics works for us

58
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:48,889
you can also connect the printer

59
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:50,290
t_v_ used to portland

60
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,239
approved the common interpreter

61
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,400
z commuter train print

62
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,059
for or your school probe

63
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:01,079
appt their and

64
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:03,609
there's also a two hundred-year level
course

65
00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:05,979
which means you can bring your goal

66
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:07,149
an awful

67
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:08,879
and connected to the virus

68
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,649
and you know it's it's the same part in
it so

69
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,729
if you call my cell or phone number

70
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:19,099
anglophone lecturing and i can of course
star from on the phone

71
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,219
outdoors

72
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:21,589
uh...

73
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:25,509
and that you can contribute unity by
just normal telephone accusing

74
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:27,969
connections or you can do it

75
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:29,309
uh...

76
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:33,448
well we're was the right the

77
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:35,049
i need to of course

78
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:39,809
connect this really old thing potato
above-mentioned the fax machine

79
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:42,069
seeking

80
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:44,929
get your faxes wherever you are

81
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,249
path

82
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:50,609
so this is one of the products
redevelopment symphonic and uh... but

83
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:52,579
they don't have mine they are in the
department

84
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:55,959
but you also do new product
introductions to lead me

85
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:57,509
anna

86
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:01,208
full forget that we hear petrol to the
test development sarah

87
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,480
we have our own production sites

88
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,819
but if it's really large volumes like
this one for example

89
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:09,349
uh... winds that managed to production

90
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:13,138
in a big factory for our customers

91
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:14,749
and whenever

92
00:04:14,749 --> 00:04:17,180
we never develop stuff for our own

93
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,480
agreed that we don't

94
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,509
but our own

95
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,719
and logo on the devices this week and
over the source code writes this false

96
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:24,529
hopes

97
00:04:24,529 --> 00:04:26,289
the right to hold on

98
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:30,050
schematics for hardware and too to our
customers so it's always the customer

99
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:30,949
who owns it

100
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:32,719
we've just broken sometimes

101
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:35,859
so if anyone has an idea for a quick
products that you would like to see

102
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,698
milti discontinued direction

103
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:43,740
problem is that the reality

104
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,370
all case let's cut it down to business

105
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,219
how

106
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:50,750
was critical infrastructure

107
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,759
uh...

108
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,620
what's right

109
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,899
critical infrastructure case function
did that we need in our daily life

110
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:59,169
or even there

111
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:05,049
something that's needed by our society
nor to function properly

112
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,969
practical like nine different

113
00:05:08,969 --> 00:05:11,759
systems that are called critical
infrastructure

114
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,280
and uh...

115
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,419
so uh...

116
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:18,770
you can see it's a electricity
generation it's characters mission does

117
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,789
and distribution of food to speak

118
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:22,120
district heating

119
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,680
transportation telecommunications

120
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,999
internet actually

121
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:30,649
like five or three years ago i would not
say that the internet is critical

122
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:32,689
infrastructure

123
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:37,659
invests here substance change my mind
mstislav important systems that's real

124
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:39,188
and rich bond

125
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:42,930
that the internet functions it's not
like

126
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,639
there's quite important base the special
transection since they're slow other

127
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,250
systems that we live in arlington
nowadays

128
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,340
so i update on the stand those there's
of course water we need that

129
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,198
oil and gas ab

130
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,330
global positioning system

131
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:01,269
and all of these systems are critical
infrastructure

132
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:03,009
and because of that

133
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:04,560
greedy are extremely

134
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,659
expected targets to what's called

135
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:08,419
so i agree warfare

136
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:11,750
and i mean i i really hate that word
slightly more prominent what's

137
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,389
whatsoever and revert

138
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:16,319
apparently that's the words of one
season so on

139
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,469
have to stick to it

140
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:21,949
if you look at this distance anything it
okay

141
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,180
these recent

142
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,130
very important baldwin

143
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,159
which system

144
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,819
would be more important which which
would be the most important system

145
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,029
and one way

146
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:32,599
senate uh...

147
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:35,120
look at this first look at cascading
effects

148
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,779
if one of them three years

149
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:40,430
which all of these critical systems will
be less well

150
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,949
so um...

151
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:43,779
if you do that

152
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,639
it would look something like this

153
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,979
week stopped unit because it electricity
generation is quite important this is a

154
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:52,449
lot of adults continent

155
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:54,080
from that point so it wouldn't

156
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,299
use either

157
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:58,919
generation or transmission distribution
electricity

158
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,900
that means you will lose a lot of other
systems

159
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,758
and uh...

160
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,259
i have a background in rick electric
utility company

161
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,199
so uh... are mostly be speaking about

162
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,649
generation and distribution of
electricity

163
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:16,379
that their most of the saw something
right here now

164
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:23,379
it's show time for all these other types
of critical infrastructure as well

165
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:27,489
okay param

166
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,698
when you say

167
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:29,929
or when i say

168
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:31,549
critical infrastructure

169
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,520
and i'm saying that there's some sort of
like the system controlling this

170
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,179
critical infrastructure

171
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:39,849
people so yeah i think that that's this
thing called scada i've seen it done by

172
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:42,089
heart

173
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:42,949
problem is

174
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:46,050
there there's a lot of other systems
which parts k dot

175
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,729
which which are just as important

176
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:50,550
and one class of those systems

177
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,739
eight-tenths what's called process
control system

178
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,840
and process control system is not enough
system

179
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,628
and the old

180
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:59,950
where usually used

181
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,529
www within the plots of some kind

182
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:05,139
to control of this in a process that
could be done

183
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:08,919
hardcore plotting laura water quality we
need to relate that

184
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:13,818
working the a boiler and by people part
comes when the bones something you're

185
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:16,679
going to want to get electricity

186
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:17,919
the spirit

187
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,818
things happening and really fast anytime
after stopping the affiant and unique in

188
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:24,360
the control of the time

189
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,029
so that's just typically process control
system stands

190
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:28,879
some users at its heart

191
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,339
electricity generation of course

192
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:33,419
water treatment plants

193
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,640
uh... oil platforms

194
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,688
and the stuff but that's the solutions

195
00:08:37,688 --> 00:08:42,699
arm mostly pcs insist on sample
programmable logic controller

196
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,700
so it's it's an embedded device which
settlements

197
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,750
firmware

198
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,260
which in this document type

199
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,010
and there's a lot of other are devices

200
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,950
and which hand these things and their
support sensors and stocks like valves

201
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,900
pumps etcetera

202
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,449
you know their species as well and
there's that

203
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:02,170
intimate

204
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,979
that stands for and you mentioned
interface

205
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,560
historians which

206
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,609
collects measurements and so you can be
training in c

207
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,160
and

208
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,199
india and

209
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,630
sees things that uh... that's the point

210
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,270
and all communication

211
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,180
israel time sooner specially phone calls

212
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,069
which like like mombasa profanities

213
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,600
even if i p ham

214
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,980
these propulsion

215
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,730
in the beginning to find for wanting to
learn

216
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,350
different possible split

217
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,420
in recent years they're actually

218
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,229
going one meeting much

219
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,230
this is what what i a m

220
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,740
typically my screen would look like porn
operator

221
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,069
you can see the mike flows into the
temperatures

222
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:50,868
and you know my goal to be able to set
somebody's like you to set did you

223
00:09:50,869 --> 00:09:53,710
decide temperatures is that uh... at the
boiler

224
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:57,330
and the control system moved should make
sure that that specific temperatures

225
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:04,250
kept at the factory that you specified

226
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,209
so this is a skate assistance scada
systems on the other hand alike

227
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:11,250
has said that those control is usually
within the plot

228
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,650
scada systems itself all the other stuff
that's outside the complex

229
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,870
enormous systems

230
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,050
and skater stands for supervisory

231
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,089
controlling the deposition

232
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,530
so it means that there is some operator
somewhere

233
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:28,839
who monitors to states off some pieces
the old system

234
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,660
and he can do some small control like
startin stock stuff

235
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,329
reducing and it's used commended like
shannon electric grid

236
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,440
point pipelines or any pipeline for that
matter

237
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,120
train control

238
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,100
typically devices to be

239
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,620
promote term limits

240
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,660
master looter monuments

241
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,610
and of course all paid work stations
here as well

242
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,920
usually pcs running windows that

243
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,640
there are unix systems as well

244
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,210
and protocols

245
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,990
are serial protocols like

246
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,140
dinky free

247
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,600
little peru purple used most in states
that in europe as well

248
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,760
and uh...

249
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,870
europeans like the r_u_c_ standards not
so we used to sixty eight seventy dash

250
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,200
five

251
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,170
they're different variants of that plan
and its

252
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,449
if you don't have to find people that's
one of four do you get the skype

253
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,030
aggression

254
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:25,199
that's one wanted to see you know

255
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,780
and implementation

256
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,839
and therein

257
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,810
base a long-distance tough so

258
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,920
you know this implementation paraffin
over

259
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,780
models are quite often used actually
institution not with the like twenty

260
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,209
four hundred goldman

261
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:43,040
to transport the information

262
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:50,040
is it is it's not much

263
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,079
and uh... the operators of the state
assistance

264
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,570
the love big screen suddenly became
comical world's unusually switches

265
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,530
screens the screens and screens

266
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,900
and the people you

267
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,060
just sittin on personal and

268
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,339
all there's something that over there in
the big one check it and

269
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,450
maybe do some small takes are

270
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,380
called someone to make its

271
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,480
that get more information

272
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,500
and uh...

273
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,080
if you look at uh... control room

274
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,139
and it's the same thing but if it's
there

275
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:24,390
operator control room for rent

276
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:28,760
elected distribution or if it's and
train controller

277
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,699
if it's even someone

278
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:34,060
the control room for

279
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,989
countrywide internets

280
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,070
standard provider

281
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:43,080
philip quite the same time the really
cool to be an

282
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,950
so uh...

283
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,280
usually a car

284
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,699
like the conditional

285
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,830
i think your jury infirm guys usually

286
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,490
joan you see the fine print c_i_a_ tried

287
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,740
confidentiality integrity availabilty

288
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,900
and usually do it in that specific order

289
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,860
i mean confidentiality is normal

290
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,260
moments the most important thing

291
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,530
for critical infrastructure

292
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,990
it's sort of the opposite

293
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,650
conferencia it's not working

294
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,010
coming if we don't measure ments on the
uh...

295
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,380
font of some type

296
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,670
at these measurements are not secret and
wait

297
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,079
and in fact it's usually the opposite is
usually the winner

298
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,830
these measurements should quite often
being reported publicly much

299
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,300
commission reporting for example

300
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,130
uh... so therefore protocols that are
used are not interested the critics

301
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,850
protocols

302
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,749
you think the immigrants local important

303
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:40,280
you wouldn't like

304
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,560
someone unauthorized to actually mean

305
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,040
sets obverse of poems from your operator
subsidy

306
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,010
sold to take it is different important

307
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,310
i mean i really think is king

308
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:56,540
if you need to be hard to control system
available ample time specific don't

309
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,189
lose control of your critical
infrastructure

310
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,860
and that sort of the bad most worst
thing that could happen kiss

311
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,160
if you're critical infrastructure goes
down

312
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,189
society

313
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,240
will not want to chat

314
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,540
so i a m

315
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,480
and which are the threats

316
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,050
to our critical infrastructure

317
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,819
if you can we start from the bottom

318
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,880
you'll see like the normal threats that

319
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,260
and his orders delude

320
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,970
on big business like you got bought that
operators

321
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,460
buyers of arms

322
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,220
creators and

323
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,990
disgruntlement niece or contractors
which aren't happy

324
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,480
but to step it up don't get paid

325
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,140
critical infrastructure

326
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,430
we got newlands of that

327
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,239
end up terrorists

328
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,200
added up foreign countries

329
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,430
we're doing the cyber warfare thing
which i

330
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,880
nights quite scary

331
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,400
and uh...

332
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,829
this means that it's a whole different
regrouping in here

333
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,569
me these specially like the foreign
countries the

334
00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:00,459
the had the people

335
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,130
we have the knowledge

336
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,050
we have the money to do about stuff

337
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,219
what i think is singing lessons that

338
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,890
they don't really have motivation

339
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,290
cus if he would

340
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,430
but we do bad stuff two or three

341
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,489
to improve infrastructure

342
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,220
these are the threats

343
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,720
so who do have from our side

344
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,320
to protect ourselves against these facts

345
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,430
it's these guys

346
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,640
mister heart how can you see you next
year

347
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,230
these are not to depict the stereotypes

348
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,890
of the persons which are

349
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,069
network admins

350
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:41,410
birth control systems

351
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,280
uh...

352
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,600
mister hardhat

353
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,580
he's got a background n automate the
simulation engineered you know he knows

354
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,150
all the devices on the control system
network

355
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,020
he still installs and he's the guy who
stroke

356
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,850
makes the stuff work insists he knows
the devices on the network

357
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,270
you figured like one prepared if he was
also responsible for the network is

358
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,020
data network it just the stuff that
makes these places to get it right

359
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,650
so it can't be too hard

360
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,699
and

361
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,830
mr yung's bid on the other hand

362
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,130
fees

363
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,760
background as to corporate network admin

364
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,970
and the reason he's responsible for the
network in the bond

365
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,030
s

366
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,290
well

367
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,160
londonsponsored kids from using boss
networks

368
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,540
into starting using

369
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,630
p_c_p_ i'd be in defense

370
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:30,970
in the book with the poor people came to
say hangups here honey fitz be

371
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,930
everything this is next

372
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,300
managed by us you guys don't understand
this

373
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,750
the corporate that our people sort of
over the past in these places

374
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:46,990
high i think that mister hardhat is the
most common

375
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,760
entrance

376
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,740
sometimes the stevens' biggest hit

377
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,570
so let me let closer please guys

378
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,400
nothing

379
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,650
justify cracked me seriously hurt

380
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,180
you know that the concept of human
spirit is that

381
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,428
the size of your veered is sort of
proportional it's it's actually

382
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:07,180
proportional to mount a few weeks
felicia

383
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,250
ac

384
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,890
the downside of having

385
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,839
units beard is of course that

386
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,770
you'll immediately

387
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,170
hair

388
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,260
so restarting apf

389
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,690
this guy he understands the availability
requirements he hopes that his system

390
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,370
should not go down pacific storm style

391
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,159
then you lose this critical
infrastructure

392
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,230
so therefore he's very fond of
redundancy he loves you don't see daniel

393
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,110
it persists like server that has a very
important function for it

394
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,100
control system

395
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,919
he made shortly dot was six

396
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,490
and they have separate power source s
and everything and they are the exact

397
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,240
same information so

398
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,950
wonderful resources with mcdonnell

399
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,420
one of the service would catch fire you
know that one of these people

400
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,540
this great

401
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,590
but what it doesn't protect you from
trees

402
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,500
if you get a virus and response and
affects your first settler justice

403
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,690
gustavo

404
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,460
opens no problem the second one think
overrides

405
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,840
but it has the exact same vulnerability

406
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,879
so it will build on slopes and
regardless of the sample was copied

407
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,460
something

408
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,720
and there

409
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,669
is department

410
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:18,320
does not speak to security

411
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,950
aram

412
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:25,020
and he also doesn't understand the
concept of metric segmentation

413
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,750
suitably do one big also leads to just

414
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,400
drop to devise a similar

415
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,610
and you get a real always network like
mark broadcast stopped and looked at the

416
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,840
going back and forth occasion to see at
that point

417
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,350
and the same can cause problems

418
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:44,050
and i'll get to that leader actually

419
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:48,830
and mister carter at also doesn't
understand security of

420
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,590
effect he doesn't like he doesn't do
that

421
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,580
here's the system is working to sit down

422
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,409
there's someone saying there's a
security patches of somewhere

423
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,229
but you know why should i suppose

424
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:02,190
coming up out of control system wait
wait

425
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,970
fix something going broke

426
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,240
hap

427
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,289
coming

428
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:08,429
new parks

429
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:12,990
brea k piece right in some sense because
if he would apply me to play catch he

430
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,799
would need to go through a lot of
testing to make sure that

431
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:19,420
dispatched doesn't affect the any part
of the control system

432
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,510
green there's always respectful quite
frankly i chew my change something

433
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,620
we could have taken part in the system
and

434
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,989
could become unbelievable

435
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:32,020
working mister you have to have on the
other hand

436
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:37,350
he's got some other skills he speaks to
skype if you weekly and eric

437
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,719
he loves access control

438
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,960
in fact he loves it so much that
immaturity all operators involves or

439
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,460
early on in this game assistant
controller work wherever

440
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,590
they need to logging with complicated
press version of the street once

441
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,439
andree

442
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,730
usually just write down post-it notes
today

443
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,269
if we see you experienced com spinal
configuration

444
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:01,780
when those post-its but

445
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,310
can also make sure that you have to
change your password or three months

446
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,500
and this is of course is

447
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,850
i mean if they'll placed

448
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,980
ought to be able to login gossip about
the password

449
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,140
and

450
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,750
menus use them

451
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,740
it will turn out to be lost control of
your critical infrastructure

452
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:23,320
so you can't really afford to risks of
having compton passwords

453
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,560
which they operate the school to get

454
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,580
case

455
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,429
you just shoot yourself in fact is you
lose the critical infrastructure control

456
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,980
and

457
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,289
misdeeds that does not want to spend

458
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:38,190
that dependencies should be mean
minimalist

459
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,180
and to give you an example

460
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,990
we could go back to this

461
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,860
authentication but users

462
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,030
so we can have a great deal of
indication by having to control system

463
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:52,700
computer spare offense defense at an
active directory and then you serve on

464
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,390
the corporate network

465
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,440
what did you have a connection to the
corporate network group home forty peace

466
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,940
and love with the long for some reason

467
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,030
and if the credentials aren't casts
locally

468
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,879
means you want me logging and you get
lost control their critical

469
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,100
infrastructure

470
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,520
and once used to be

471
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,560
usage of ph

472
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,770
deeply for a dynamic type unisys uh...

473
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,370
if you need to do something to stop

474
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:25,418
maybe the opry workstations what people
do not pianist and

475
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:28,400
the problems there

476
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,070
used human spirit

477
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,879
hilton lights on tue march

478
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,320
so he puts on tomorrow's products unlike
industry

479
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,370
there's a big risk of that with this of
course uh...

480
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:41,939
kids there's always falls post posted
sandy on tonight's program

481
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,360
and that they need to be post posted

482
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,840
in in eighteen products

483
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,970
devil denying operators are actually
going through some

484
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,920
system or some implication he needs

485
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,320
to control this is the critical
infrastructure

486
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,800
that being the big problem

487
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,090
uh... and if you're in spirit

488
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,389
at best notes also not pat test purchase
property

489
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:08,029
out so you can read your own too long a
secured about who we cannot testify and

490
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:08,879
that the north

491
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:10,439
before you really

492
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,559
strip stardom

493
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:13,730
and deployment on the on

494
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,570
control system which controls triple in
the structure

495
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,879
let me see you next issue justify sequel

496
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,770
just like to do important bridge

497
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:27,950
for the next morning difference between
them

498
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,549
older trend

499
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:30,680
we're seeing

500
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,830
or not conceding by work

501
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,909
correctly

502
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,990
buildings there used to be to control
system that works

503
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,540
and there was the corporate network

504
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,050
due to two types of things

505
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,340
and

506
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,939
there wasn't really in need to do
connect them together at that point

507
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,230
and indeed they were kind enough to cc

508
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,460
but not least

509
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,220
there are quite strong and

510
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,810
business incentives for to actually to
be consistent

511
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:01,928
didn't have

512
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:05,460
reports coming out for all of your
control system could be the missions

513
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,960
reports mansion earnings

514
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,490
trends from the controls as the newly
liked it down to

515
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,490
how the people

516
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,420
and themselves information on your way
like you do plants production plants

517
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,910
have plans for

518
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,289
planned stops its ok

519
00:23:20,289 --> 00:23:22,149
on the court the pepperdine want to

520
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:23,770
much information

521
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,840
into the control system

522
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,480
so these systems are getting indicated

523
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,870
he d come through this topic

524
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,760
what's important is to make sure that

525
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,330
integrationist on property

526
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,668
for the first question users vasquez

527
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:39,299
it's the interconnection controlled by
farm

528
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:42,270
missionaries companies

529
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:46,350
next question should be okies of those
responsible for the school

530
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,980
is is that the corporate system

531
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,710
parts of the control system owner

532
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,040
pillars of the corporate networking

533
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,559
the control system people would usually
so you know we should be we should be

534
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,700
responsible for the part what you know

535
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,730
and corporate network and got all sorts

536
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,470
lots of users lots of

537
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:05,750
external people coming in connecting to
the network you've got

538
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:10,370
and permit people to report scans of the
slip working on

539
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:15,039
longer people take our system works on
the score but the point at the moment so

540
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,180
you really want to protect the controls
a simple

541
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,660
the corporate system

542
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,930
hope a group of people on the other in
the signal no we should be responsible

543
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:26,260
for this where we might you want to
protect the corporate network because

544
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,320
you guys at the control system

545
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,100
you're not touching properly

546
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,330
and you're not running antivirus

547
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:35,300
people are not needing to change your
password you know you've got a jury

548
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,830
system we hope that we need to protect
themselves from it

549
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,490
mccree there's a very simple solution on

550
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,630
that you're aware of its higher

551
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:47,700
it's assumed that you should be the end
zone between the networks

552
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,720
like to control system network

553
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,610
have been responsible for the one of the
private and corporate people forgot

554
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,860
about

555
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,899
it's a very simple solution it's chief
anna

556
00:24:58,899 --> 00:24:59,830
the sad part

557
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:04,779
case that we don't see this and what
places

558
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:11,010
and onward

559
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,910
on the part that sat is that

560
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,139
some lessons

561
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,639
aren't really good

562
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,490
actually uni a control systems and state
assistance

563
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,010
when you buy a device

564
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:25,680
you should use it should last for twenty
year sentence dot com to buy a new

565
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,050
monson when you want system

566
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:28,990
and it

567
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:32,390
you're not supposed to catch anything
during that time unity by device you use

568
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,600
it

569
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,959
and and

570
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,630
the slightest usually

571
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:40,540
comparably terry operating systems

572
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:44,879
sometimes will notice you're starting to
see my next for example in the nixon

573
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,090
these devices but usually expected
operating systems

574
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:53,610
i'm not sure if it's good to spend
property open systems also means that

575
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:57,810
it is very precise would be proper terry
so each gender would do their own he's

576
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,330
about to start

577
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,210
and uh...

578
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,179
hectic wanted right

579
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:07,630
between if you think this tax cut down
some map testing to to do some brutal

580
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,090
crossing on from different places

581
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,840
and had to say to somebody these people

582
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,039
keeps you can just coming down

583
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,120
and on the question candy

584
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,649
didn't make the did to use the first
people and

585
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,800
too

586
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,250
if you try to make it crashes buchanan

587
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:31,140
to have to be worked really hard and
investing in cebu actually achieved to

588
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,460
get windows good people see section of
the groups

589
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,600
uh...

590
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,199
complete yay

591
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,649
reboot problem is

592
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:41,389
these devices reboot in like two hundred
milliseconds they're not going to

593
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,540
control nepean

594
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,379
cemented nothing

595
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,790
other devices called really crappy

596
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:52,950
happens thing which doctor or devices
which i really crappy

597
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,420
uh... qualifies for example

598
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,750
itself crashed on instrumentation either
country

599
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,690
start fighting and in fact and then

600
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,910
later on tonight's because enough to
send

601
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:06,190
eighties piece in packets the device

602
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,760
that became on sponsored didn't
accidentally more

603
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,929
that's going on

604
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:14,809
manually power cycle it's going to get
the working and imagine that like

605
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:16,590
devices sitting out

606
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,379
in a critical infrastructure

607
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,150
and people who have to go around for
recycle it to get to a critical

608
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,809
infrastructure program again

609
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:28,490
because someone sent any gates to cibc
packets that

610
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,030
sewer

611
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,730
this actually quite scary

612
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,490
having crappy

613
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,640
tuesday kazakhs in these devices

614
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,529
store

615
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:43,140
what could happen in section

616
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,400
has happened

617
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,670
and is this

618
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:51,610
three years ago and runs for nuclear
continues

619
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,959
there was a device malfunctioned

620
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,440
it's plugged networks except it done

621
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,490
been flogged in the group

622
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,790
tulips uh... amount that

623
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:04,330
the words who congestion of magma
purpose it was still possible to get

624
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:08,549
messages to or not there to the devices

625
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:10,440
there were some devices

626
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,339
wage

627
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:12,210
uh...

628
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,360
crashed because of this

629
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,408
preceding contend that the handled at
the moment traffic

630
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:19,400
so they just sort of dot

631
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:24,020
and and he symbolizes the tide we're
we're controllers for

632
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:27,320
brutal treatment and rice which

633
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,289
and controlled pumps

634
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:32,600
and not just any points that the pumps
for

635
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,740
the reactors circulation poems

636
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,049
and anything

637
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:38,210
in america and you can come

638
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,940
pass the word reactor in it

639
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,559
is quite important so you know

640
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,629
the operators to be required making

641
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,340
actually describe

642
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,780
this reactor at this crime scene
audiences checkbooks leading men need to

643
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,610
be shut down the actor

644
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:56,600
dv means pumps what

645
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,059
nowadays actually

646
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:02,980
they sort of this from spare concerts
cup finals

647
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,350
all over right now

648
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,870
me i read that baby

649
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,550
they would be one because

650
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:12,120
the device such pain and start to
produce this topic which was from bunk

651
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,110
one man there

652
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,740
and the other devices which uh...

653
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,190
class because this traffic was from
another vendor nbsp

654
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,019
there's no point to having these two
system something that works in their

655
00:29:22,019 --> 00:29:23,350
rightful owners

656
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,678
two different fabrics and property for a
moment

657
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,720
firewall in between

658
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,860
but it's not just kind of crappy devices

659
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:36,419
wife there are devices on the net
recruits

660
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,680
aren't you or someone supposed to be
there

661
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,500
let's say for example an operator

662
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,250
figures that k

663
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:47,730
when people nice if articulated ah...
instead of sitting on the opry really

664
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,890
controlled

665
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:52,910
but you ought to be coffee room and
still on thursday that the club so he he

666
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,940
drops the wifi access points

667
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,780
on the control system that works
clearing basis laptop from home and sits

668
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,120
in the coffin

669
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,520
and figures they have this done

670
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,279
in this company is uh... a statement is
you know

671
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:08,200
ability to introduce networking better
from here

672
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,549
of course this guy doesn't know anything
about infection so like

673
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:14,418
jungle in a parking lot more to be able
to

674
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:16,410
look at the control system

675
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,060
but maybe even

676
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,139
do something once it is

677
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,720
for puzzle

678
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,250
and uh...

679
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,609
three if you could soon

680
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:28,019
if you ask the admin often up to say

681
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:33,269
okay so what hosts army depot in your
control system at work

682
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:35,940
and let's start off by asking mister
hart

683
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,370
you know he'd go to his file cabinets

684
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,870
to bring up a binder

685
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:43,779
and start bringing up papers at all or
part of my documentation

686
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:45,610
he started by since i have

687
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,379
uh... so that should be correct c

688
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,190
asking yet

689
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,940
bets

690
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:54,480
devices that scar on your paper in which
devices or network

691
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,000
and he wouldn't really understand the
question 'cause

692
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,670
he fears like why would someone put
something in in the network without

693
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:04,419
informing me without asking me

694
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:05,590
guilty of course

695
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,110
is different and

696
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,530
a lot of times

697
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,920
mister hard up to you know could stop
himself

698
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,500
on the network without

699
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,280
actually running done properly

700
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,899
thought let's ask mister your expelled

701
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:24,169
mysterious disease for peace quietly
diagnosing silky

702
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:28,440
he answers you directly in in in the end
of our language

703
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,320
so that

704
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,399
buffoons cycle which exercises going on
an option

705
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,370
adams

706
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:35,678
with the vessels which and then

707
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,149
arguments of equipment

708
00:31:37,149 --> 00:31:40,169
this on the train and uh...

709
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:43,090
this means that he's going to to what's
going on

710
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,790
can sleep on the network

711
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,760
and he's gonna commit

712
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,220
two different services and uh...

713
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,559
try to figure out the operating system
that's what the

714
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:53,668
daschle switches for

715
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:56,820
it's going to active stab off the system

716
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:00,210
and you know more respected by system
engineer

717
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,529
so technically this is the critical
moment

718
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:04,649
vacuuming etc record by saddam

719
00:32:04,649 --> 00:32:06,000
it looking at

720
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,320
solak

721
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,669
don't everyone this spot an active
system

722
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:16,470
if this could be used to control panel
critical infrastructure

723
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,450
a solution there's a solution lucky

724
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,370
the reactor of monitoring

725
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:24,489
my period and the network monitoring
para

726
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:27,500
two leading public mine and uh...

727
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,559
so what you see this

728
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,490
go to a good point eight central point
of metrics

729
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,530
connecting it to attack

730
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:37,980
guest on port on switch mundra port to
whatever you think quote

731
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,860
sony you can get a copy off the traffic
going

732
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,229
communiclique

733
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,630
she had a copy of traffic

734
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,870
any recordings

735
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,789
to keep that fire

736
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:50,120
i'd recommend using either to speed up
dumped that

737
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,510
actually i think bumped up is the best

738
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,460
nobody

739
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,520
and

740
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,299
and admit that capture

741
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:58,980
to find a cure for everyone

742
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,990
by the traffic going through captured
two five gimme the tone for a couple of

743
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:06,120
hours or a couple of days if you wish

744
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,939
menu when you feel you have enough

745
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,020
disconnects

746
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,190
you and mom came to me

747
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,410
and you're going to end up buying

748
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,750
and i suspect that picket line

749
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,220
usually people went

750
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,880
michel for while shark

751
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,240
are long or short

752
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,090
uh... it's it's a great program

753
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,129
an

754
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:27,520
you community involvement in all the
stuff in witnesses not propose

755
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,090
to help help people are sitting don't
have to do it manually

756
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:31,899
uh...

757
00:33:31,899 --> 00:33:35,549
but it's quite difficult if you have a
lot of taking you do not to get all of

758
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:36,160
your

759
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,279
which hosts to have want to be doing

760
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,360
and

761
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,529
so actually this is one of the reasons i
started looking

762
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:46,840
the tool called never primer

763
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,720
network minors in open source too

764
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,679
so they won't sourceforge

765
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,480
but you do see even though the pick-up
for the internet

766
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,190
it would bring up a nice lists

767
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:57,370
outposts

768
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:01,080
sets the scene communicating on this
picket line

769
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,820
crucial with operating systems of
peoples

770
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,879
it was sold uh...

771
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,069
and names of the whole story

772
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:10,219
to begin the gets dena static

773
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:14,289
so it connects to the dean s hookups
with three-year i claudius you know it's

774
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:16,959
on the stand that expires silly

775
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:19,828
ultimate points names are connected with
this

776
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:21,659
agency which spread

777
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,609
ports are open

778
00:34:23,609 --> 00:34:26,569
just received the traffic is comfortable
sports

779
00:34:26,569 --> 00:34:27,270
the trim

780
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:30,339
so that's actually when i started my
network minor

781
00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:34,208
uh... but there's overtime i had more
countries like

782
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:38,558
files transferred over inequities candy
extracted order automatic expected if

783
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,820
they're sent the proposed like h_t_t_p_

784
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,259
fifty p

785
00:34:42,259 --> 00:34:43,978
g_d_p_

786
00:34:43,978 --> 00:34:47,009
s indeed sector

787
00:34:47,009 --> 00:34:52,509
recently uh... also had a dinner file
extraction when you send it from me

788
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:57,499
is that miss message and thank you to
know what's good for just a propos

789
00:34:57,499 --> 00:35:00,038
solar and i will send some

790
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:03,399
or snapshot vocals and i've seen

791
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:04,669
mutation

792
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:09,999
and so it's it's you right now it's and
really uh... network forensics too

793
00:35:09,999 --> 00:35:11,198
antsy

794
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:14,309
now used quite a lot of different

795
00:35:14,309 --> 00:35:17,139
frenzy people and then

796
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:20,240
noble park police and the purpose people

797
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,508
unity sits atop

798
00:35:23,509 --> 00:35:24,729
what took a quick break

799
00:35:24,729 --> 00:35:27,558
and you know top campaign

800
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:30,039
neither i'm not talking about metric
mind but

801
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:31,469
that's not going on here

802
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:33,059
for so ever

803
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:37,089
if you if you need something like one
certainly might try to look at the hosts

804
00:35:37,089 --> 00:35:38,439
you can see that

805
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:41,308
compared to hosts which are really on
the network

806
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:43,989
to the piece of paper that mister harmon
showed you

807
00:35:43,989 --> 00:35:47,090
and it's quite an interesting to see
which our differences

808
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,439
and to do anything with michelle y

809
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:53,408
they aren't the same

810
00:35:53,409 --> 00:35:56,189
soul

811
00:35:56,189 --> 00:35:57,709
mother

812
00:35:57,709 --> 00:36:02,939
fifty things to handle h_m_o_ taxes

813
00:36:02,939 --> 00:36:07,129
there is a big lead to be able to
provide remote access for other people

814
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,729
then once working in the box

815
00:36:09,729 --> 00:36:11,410
if you take to get to have

816
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,769
and a experts from the vendors

817
00:36:13,769 --> 00:36:17,269
bring the vendors on one student's to
produce the system to produce these

818
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:18,238
devices

819
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:21,450
if you want to get expert help cute
typically turned to the vendor and then

820
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,899
there's the complete

821
00:36:22,899 --> 00:36:25,888
not in sweden har

822
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:28,900
may be over in the states and

823
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,319
but expensive intake

824
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:34,538
form of trying to get a flying were
every time you need help with something

825
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:38,030
so we can make a lot of money p actually
read into providing axes

826
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:41,949
to your critical infrastructure for this
vendor

827
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,389
same thing with us

828
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:44,780
and engineers

829
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,789
i_q_ your local stop that

830
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:50,379
he might come home sleep the night and
you might not afford to her

831
00:36:50,379 --> 00:36:52,229
people there all night

832
00:36:52,229 --> 00:36:54,288
they can be home but on call

833
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:56,200
so that means that something goes wrong

834
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,029
bilkul

835
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,989
oh engineers need to be able to move
quickly

836
00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:02,219
connective control system

837
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:04,650
to troubleshoot or coffee or something

838
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,110
or just to see that

839
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:09,689
is this very important that we need to
go in going to the phones were

840
00:37:09,689 --> 00:37:12,899
can i stayed home and take it in the
morning when i come there

841
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:15,439
from for instance you love mum

842
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:19,499
and becoming from provide this remote
access to all these people

843
00:37:19,499 --> 00:37:23,049
date d old-school money of course is
having moments

844
00:37:23,049 --> 00:37:25,919
at the concert beams and shifted out now

845
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:27,149
and uh... and

846
00:37:27,149 --> 00:37:28,578
interment

847
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,529
case with him

848
00:37:29,529 --> 00:37:31,039
onestat

849
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:32,029
and

850
00:37:32,029 --> 00:37:38,119
and ups that means please call me
provides internet access to these people

851
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:40,760
so for specific aspects of heart

852
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,599
this gary she figures that walker an
internet connection at home

853
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:47,779
and why don't i just do the same thing
called my

854
00:37:47,779 --> 00:37:50,199
local provider and just connect them

855
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:54,349
internet right into my thoughts

856
00:37:54,349 --> 00:37:56,740
of course that's me back to the case

857
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,020
not only with me

858
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,719
experts getting but also the packers

859
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:02,519
surround

860
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:05,499
i'd like to see you experience solution
much better

861
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:07,138
he would typically go for

862
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:11,019
select all but do you have a good dpm
solution for corporates

863
00:38:11,019 --> 00:38:12,169
third parties

864
00:38:12,169 --> 00:38:14,209
two hundred just use that one

865
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:18,469
to to have the third parties coming into
the corporate begin we just hung them

866
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:20,899
seemed to the controls of the network

867
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:23,229
yeah i think that's a good idea actually

868
00:38:23,229 --> 00:38:27,888
and because the corporate people uchida
recruits

869
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,349
hopefully independent solutions fractals

870
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:33,619
authentication born party coming in

871
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:37,309
what what i think you need to add this
to happen at racism beginning to see

872
00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:41,859
who logs in twenty million and what they
did after they've not been

873
00:38:41,859 --> 00:38:44,109
you poor souls and controls that

874
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:48,348
third-party isn't even touches anything
else but the single in the system that

875
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:51,269
he's supposed to be able to access

876
00:38:51,269 --> 00:38:55,408
and i would also recommend to the
network monitoring section report

877
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:57,749
everything that's been done most by this

878
00:38:57,749 --> 00:38:59,348
third-party vendor

879
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:02,489
when you come in so that you can
afterwards

880
00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:06,379
if something goes wrong direction
investigates

881
00:39:06,379 --> 00:39:09,558
what went wrong

882
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:13,969
buttercup burglary axis no matter how
many do it it's always a big risk

883
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:16,349
and there there's been

884
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:18,209
this incident

885
00:39:18,209 --> 00:39:20,178
in two thousand three

886
00:39:20,179 --> 00:39:21,399
in it

887
00:39:21,399 --> 00:39:23,098
database the

888
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:27,209
lecture typically bridge nuclear plant
in the u_s_

889
00:39:27,209 --> 00:39:29,890
contacted this landlord

890
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,439
uh...

891
00:39:31,439 --> 00:39:32,549
what happened is that

892
00:39:32,549 --> 00:39:36,239
that this coming peace there's plenty of
defense we have really good perimeter

893
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:37,059
security

894
00:39:37,059 --> 00:39:40,669
being the fire on someplace everywhere

895
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:43,828
this vendor who who had the remote
access

896
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:49,239
hitachi one line it's image actually
came in inside the file

897
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:52,719
and it's been against my thought there
was a server infected

898
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:54,729
uh... with someone

899
00:39:54,729 --> 00:40:00,158
and that infection with straight up to
do thirty one ninety two

900
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,879
to nuclear plants

901
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:04,118
and uh...

902
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:09,369
as a result of this the the safety
monitoring systems symbol for five hours

903
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:11,619
and just not that of course

904
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:13,259
and uh...

905
00:40:13,259 --> 00:40:17,119
i've got some people here are thinking
okay so not to write you two examples

906
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,449
both examples are from nuclear

907
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:22,100
twice that are are believers people
really

908
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,159
standards even socked the tight security

909
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,799
and not real answers no

910
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:31,869
not extensive nuclear people on the
internet security people try to others

911
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:33,410
nuclear people also have

912
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:34,368
there

913
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:38,279
they're forced to eat something like
this happen they're forced to publicly

914
00:40:38,279 --> 00:40:38,999
non-citizens

915
00:40:38,999 --> 00:40:41,269
and it didn't go to report to

916
00:40:41,269 --> 00:40:43,520
and mercy and for example there

917
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,940
to speak up in the meeting the speedway
conservative commander again so if it's

918
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,019
a truck

919
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:53,269
and so that we need to put the public to
be the most information

920
00:40:53,269 --> 00:40:55,220
and media catches up of course

921
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,750
if something happens the nuclear plants
all over the papers that this

922
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,750
informations

923
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:02,029
much more easily accessible

924
00:41:02,029 --> 00:41:06,690
i can assure you the exact same things
like weren't unwise infections

925
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:10,329
and crappy devices split

926
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:11,679
it's not something somehow

927
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:15,239
has happened in the will other types of
critical infrastructure

928
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,169
just that

929
00:41:16,169 --> 00:41:19,098
information in the east the phones

930
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:25,099
no one ever tells you about

931
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:27,229
other things that happened units

932
00:41:27,229 --> 00:41:28,499
mapped out

933
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:30,269
laptops

934
00:41:30,269 --> 00:41:34,288
yeah they might convicted only
technicians we need to use laptops two

935
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:36,649
nineteen pm devices to go around

936
00:41:36,649 --> 00:41:40,839
connecting pc your computer is something
that advice on on the control system

937
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:43,189
when scada system

938
00:41:43,189 --> 00:41:47,339
had to do com configuration do
troubleshooting

939
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:48,529
but no

940
00:41:48,529 --> 00:41:51,240
when there aren't that work they
probably have been laptop at home

941
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,049
female connected to internet children
might use it to surf the internet you

942
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,400
promote would work

943
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,739
with at one minute but but

944
00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:00,589
somewhere

945
00:42:00,589 --> 00:42:04,288
this is really tricky problem to have

946
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:06,959
andrews of course enhancements

947
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:08,609
this is one example

948
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,249
the water treatment plants high-spirited

949
00:42:11,249 --> 00:42:13,428
graphic in three years ago

950
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:16,119
uh... withstand what

951
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:19,989
so uh... and you're vector they do what
happened is that the employees had an

952
00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:22,639
apple computer equipment

953
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:25,109
and infected and fitness center

954
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:25,950
on this

955
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:29,459
uh... where treatment plant

956
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:30,419
and the recent as well

957
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,909
reached in use

958
00:42:31,909 --> 00:42:32,909
west because

959
00:42:32,909 --> 00:42:37,039
the f_b_i_ were investigating terrorist
movement in this

960
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:40,339
so they were big news about as part of
terrorists in our

961
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:42,538
water treatment plants

962
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:47,249
uh... i think that's quite called
actually

963
00:42:47,249 --> 00:42:51,988
the people in the strongest p_g_ i'm
pretty sure they did take the dance

964
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:56,849
stands for and what infection by senior
all or or servers going to be it's

965
00:42:56,849 --> 00:42:58,849
really still to be

966
00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:01,659
yeah and purposeful something's wrong

967
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:04,640
many brings hearings on the projects for
teens

968
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,328
x nissan truck being parked look at the
sirens and don't you get a spam

969
00:43:08,329 --> 00:43:09,909
stumbling fiction

970
00:43:09,909 --> 00:43:12,089
aunty

971
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,709
i'm pretty sure that

972
00:43:13,709 --> 00:43:16,529
terrorists will not gain control of that
sir

973
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:19,630
it wouldn't start since pat might be on
your concern there

974
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:23,869
piece of arguments to the american
public and richard and do something else

975
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:25,569
like sit there quietly

976
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:26,519
to some

977
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:29,238
no bandwidth mekong six hundred-page

978
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:33,079
and just wait new plan to back to work
this week for like moment in the

979
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:34,909
coordinated attacks

980
00:43:34,909 --> 00:43:36,869
possibly taking a settles

981
00:43:36,869 --> 00:43:39,899
yeah phones at the same time

982
00:43:39,899 --> 00:43:44,109
and that's the scary part is that

983
00:43:44,109 --> 00:43:45,920
if they're going to be interests

984
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,879
they would never have the tickets

985
00:43:47,879 --> 00:43:50,569
so who knows maybe we have a lot of
times

986
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:52,038
or effective

987
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:53,409
but no one s

988
00:43:53,409 --> 00:43:59,169
the landlords noticed

989
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:00,999
open other problems

990
00:44:00,999 --> 00:44:04,709
physical security i mentioned earlier
that state assistance is peace be all

991
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:05,979
systems

992
00:44:05,979 --> 00:44:07,019
review which

993
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:10,299
and you know they can cover a whole
country some sometimes

994
00:44:10,299 --> 00:44:11,349
and

995
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:13,460
so how can you call me controlled

996
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:16,079
physical access because it does get
systems used

997
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,420
that means that the control system that
would permit

998
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,529
ski remembrances minuscule effort needs
to be huge as well

999
00:44:21,529 --> 00:44:23,999
from the control axis

1000
00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:26,589
physical access to that might work

1001
00:44:26,589 --> 00:44:28,150
sizzle we would have liked

1002
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:30,800
not just interested in trouble and stock

1003
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,029
i could put it in the people's home

1004
00:44:34,029 --> 00:44:37,329
so it's very hard to controlled access
the system

1005
00:44:37,329 --> 00:44:38,769
annuals online

1006
00:44:38,769 --> 00:44:42,029
committee could sub stations and
transformer stations they usually broken

1007
00:44:42,029 --> 00:44:42,849
into

1008
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:46,219
mockery he starts to break in aren't
actors

1009
00:44:46,219 --> 00:44:49,279
in just a donkey trying to steal copper

1010
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,309
and um...

1011
00:44:51,309 --> 00:44:52,419
lonesome

1012
00:44:52,419 --> 00:44:56,429
forgets to be looked at that point

1013
00:44:56,429 --> 00:44:57,559
there are

1014
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:02,649
like one one call home what will happen
because there's they receive proper

1015
00:45:02,649 --> 00:45:04,819
and physical security is this

1016
00:45:04,819 --> 00:45:07,959
this is just polish teenager nastier

1017
00:45:07,959 --> 00:45:09,279
fifty adults

1018
00:45:09,279 --> 00:45:11,689
how to connect to the end

1019
00:45:11,689 --> 00:45:13,729
tram and control systems

1020
00:45:13,729 --> 00:45:16,718
these proceedings biggest city involves

1021
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:18,729
so he table to connect

1022
00:45:18,729 --> 00:45:23,328
and he figured out how to strengthen
control commands the system

1023
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:24,290
and he didn't

1024
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:25,550
four vehicles

1025
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:28,149
twelve people were injured in this

1026
00:45:28,149 --> 00:45:30,999
and uh...

1027
00:45:30,999 --> 00:45:32,839
the fine print is that

1028
00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:35,920
a lot of people cement albrecht yeah
sure that you know

1029
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,340
you might be able to get access to our
scada network but you would be wouldn't

1030
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,760
understand interests

1031
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,539
doings

1032
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:43,199
obscure protocol

1033
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:44,760
and property and control

1034
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,899
personal public speculate the vote

1035
00:45:46,899 --> 00:45:50,098
how would he ever understand what the
heck is going on how to use it

1036
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:51,209
well i can see

1037
00:45:51,209 --> 00:45:54,569
he was deposed teenager figure this out

1038
00:45:54,569 --> 00:45:56,169
my himself

1039
00:45:56,169 --> 00:45:57,808
and was able to come true

1040
00:45:57,809 --> 00:46:01,989
tinted to derail several giants so um...

1041
00:46:01,989 --> 00:46:04,429
and produce your

1042
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:06,379
tigers can t

1043
00:46:06,379 --> 00:46:08,919
we cannot media actually

1044
00:46:08,919 --> 00:46:10,899
maybe

1045
00:46:10,899 --> 00:46:13,979
probably polish teenagers are smarter

1046
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:15,848
interests

1047
00:46:15,849 --> 00:46:21,749
terrorists have money we can go to
poland employees posting a gain weight

1048
00:46:21,749 --> 00:46:23,609
uh... than that

1049
00:46:23,609 --> 00:46:27,299
the more scared parts which is foreign
states

1050
00:46:27,299 --> 00:46:29,489
their money in people

1051
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:31,819
and was very nice investing in the
handbook

1052
00:46:31,819 --> 00:46:33,290
cyber warfare people

1053
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,399
you can do about scams dot

1054
00:46:35,399 --> 00:46:36,609
british or name

1055
00:46:36,609 --> 00:46:42,848
figure out these portable in just a
matter of hours

1056
00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:45,619
here's the solution of course

1057
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:49,839
intersection better physical security
meaning when it's possible

1058
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:52,429
can you print or in some time to in all

1059
00:46:52,429 --> 00:46:53,619
have but

1060
00:46:53,619 --> 00:46:57,149
why not use scheme to propose that
support if indication

1061
00:46:57,149 --> 00:47:01,979
the signal i don't think there's any
need for encryption to be honest

1062
00:47:01,979 --> 00:47:05,288
but including visa syndication

1063
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:09,129
today under our proposal billable art
there too quickly protocols like secured

1064
00:47:09,129 --> 00:47:10,368
the industry

1065
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,509
and

1066
00:47:11,509 --> 00:47:15,819
and are insensitive to the people on
bench side

1067
00:47:15,819 --> 00:47:21,599
also means are some canadian almost the
same for both

1068
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,420
they had two different mostly running

1069
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:26,130
among the most issues and i settle which
means it

1070
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:30,999
youngest authentication production bus
encryption slow yourselves in a national

1071
00:47:30,999 --> 00:47:33,819
rescind which shell

1072
00:47:33,819 --> 00:47:36,590
doesn't have only some correction in its
products

1073
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:39,719
doston decently job of indicating

1074
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:42,959
and the other end

1075
00:47:42,959 --> 00:47:46,919
but you cannot say and deploy intrusion
detection

1076
00:47:46,919 --> 00:47:48,529
some people might think

1077
00:47:48,529 --> 00:47:50,550
intrusion prevention could be a good
idea

1078
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,009
i'd say no

1079
00:47:52,009 --> 00:47:54,140
intrusion prevention

1080
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:58,098
passports paul states which means you
can probably blocks on come on which we

1081
00:47:58,099 --> 00:47:59,349
should go through

1082
00:47:59,349 --> 00:48:01,909
it's not an intended to use that

1083
00:48:01,909 --> 00:48:02,730
so

1084
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:06,419
intrusion detection and young on that's
perfect

1085
00:48:06,419 --> 00:48:07,089
nests

1086
00:48:07,089 --> 00:48:08,769
my favorites

1087
00:48:08,769 --> 00:48:11,758
doo-doo proper network security monthly

1088
00:48:11,759 --> 00:48:14,989
sold

1089
00:48:14,989 --> 00:48:16,249
well it's not that busy

1090
00:48:16,249 --> 00:48:20,158
if you give you get an intrusion
detection active u_c_l_a_'s idea system

1091
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:22,939
and he didn't emerge

1092
00:48:22,939 --> 00:48:26,229
how do you know that was a real irked
oracle's boston's if you have have

1093
00:48:26,229 --> 00:48:28,529
proper network wandering solution in
england

1094
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:32,440
he'd have to take that and a couple
times company post symbol

1095
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,490
and see what really happened a_b_c_ if
there was

1096
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:37,519
someone actually helped me to talk

1097
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:38,759
comedienne

1098
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,710
gain gaining control of some system

1099
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:45,059
he can see what did he do after gaining
control treaty program

1100
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:49,589
all people over to new hosts to infect
and lauren potential them up and coming

1101
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:51,909
back doors upload download

1102
00:48:51,909 --> 00:48:52,949
and

1103
00:48:52,949 --> 00:48:57,179
new software this compromised server

1104
00:48:57,179 --> 00:49:00,910
uh... so it means that gives you a
monster

1105
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:04,199
parliament investigate pre-taped

1106
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:07,669
soloing

1107
00:49:07,669 --> 00:49:09,199
action this

1108
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:11,939
this is all for me so

1109
00:49:11,939 --> 00:49:15,069
any questions

1110
00:49:15,069 --> 00:49:16,249
to inflation

1111
00:49:16,249 --> 00:49:19,129

architect

1113
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:23,169
that's very good okay thank you very
much at all

1114
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:24,288
why i say

1115
00:49:24,289 --> 00:49:28,789
maybe a little bit more curious but you
were talking about a copycat by spending

1116
00:49:28,789 --> 00:49:29,470
dates and

1117
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:33,249
packets sister devices being used today

1118
00:49:33,249 --> 00:49:35,198
out

1119
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:37,079
bucket off but i mean

1120
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:41,910
yeah i think i'm not going to see too
much has a lot of canton versus like

1121
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:43,330
this are used

1122
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:47,259
device that because that she did what
she did in the

1123
00:49:47,259 --> 00:49:50,959
more expensive stuff mcwethy good
artifacts and it is

1124
00:49:50,959 --> 00:49:51,930
he's got the wrong

1125
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:54,058
are quite cheap and uh...

1126
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:57,189
therefore produced but i'm not saying
where they're used and what they used

1127
00:49:57,189 --> 00:50:00,689
for but yet people are using them

1128
00:50:00,689 --> 00:50:03,689
are scott

1129
00:50:03,689 --> 00:50:05,489
you're also talking about it

1130
00:50:05,489 --> 00:50:08,700
some operating systems are doing this
pattern summer during the sparks of

1131
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,660
course from niit

1132
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:13,819
i know about some things that are
available in sweden i mean not some

1133
00:50:13,819 --> 00:50:16,808
devices that are in the first thoughts
when and what what kind of operating

1134
00:50:16,809 --> 00:50:22,849
systems iran and children being used in
embedded devices and sweden partners

1135
00:50:22,849 --> 00:50:26,819
uh... i have seen coming

1136
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:29,239
usually

1137
00:50:29,239 --> 00:50:34,269
uh... indepen there's aren't using
computers as all operating system and

1138
00:50:34,269 --> 00:50:35,689
this is uh...

1139
00:50:35,689 --> 00:50:39,149
usually don't even have a public input
they don't want to know

1140
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:41,020
but there's an operating system on it
did

1141
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:45,130
you should look at it they want to look
after devices like something physical

1142
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:47,429
i'd almost mechanical

1143
00:50:47,429 --> 00:50:52,399
sentencing complex software or pc
displaced people stop thinking open my

1144
00:50:52,399 --> 00:50:53,719
computer

1145
00:50:53,719 --> 00:50:57,349
people realize that they may be the
citizens of a secure as before

1146
00:50:57,349 --> 00:51:01,539
so there they collect the actually put
conducting students speak much about

1147
00:51:01,539 --> 00:51:04,929
for for more info or elice on them

1148
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:07,379
were actually research and and and and

1149
00:51:07,379 --> 00:51:10,098
the people organising much more at

1150
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:11,200
opens works like

1151
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,968
the nexus becoming quite common and i
thought about this

1152
00:51:14,969 --> 00:51:16,449
uh...

1153
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:18,060
of course leaves usually

1154
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:20,819
you know there are some distance which
have been playing performance but

1155
00:51:20,819 --> 00:51:22,219
usually in billings

1156
00:51:22,219 --> 00:51:26,100
so conference links combined with from
from the plane palm

1157
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:29,719
always which destiny bomb stuff

1158
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:33,879
so that's my guess is a trend

1159
00:51:33,879 --> 00:51:34,680
and

1160
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,558
have you seen anything about what we're
doing here and sweden compared to other

1161
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,029
countries are doing

1162
00:51:40,029 --> 00:51:42,700
maybe we have a more friend of doing it

1163
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:46,618
and a more secure way do we have more
understanding of the surrey let

1164
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:49,579
collecting behind

1165
00:51:49,579 --> 00:51:51,980
outstanding substantially for quite

1166
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,439
security aware

1167
00:51:53,439 --> 00:51:54,769
but on the other hand

1168
00:51:54,769 --> 00:51:59,089
what we we have quite a lot of new
technology really uh...

1169
00:51:59,089 --> 00:52:03,019
and like the nordic countries we have a
lot of aren't consistent which means

1170
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:03,928
that

1171
00:52:03,929 --> 00:52:05,940
we have a problem in the first one step

1172
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:08,719
connect the thing i think he's got the
entire plants

1173
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:10,809
which is of course a big risk

1174
00:52:10,809 --> 00:52:13,999
so i i mean it's good that for security
where

1175
00:52:13,999 --> 00:52:17,259
we're taking the risk because we do see
new technology done typically they

1176
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:20,369
wouldn't in the u_s_ they're still using
model

1177
00:52:20,369 --> 00:52:22,099
c_e_o_ stoplight

1178
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:22,869
and

1179
00:52:22,869 --> 00:52:25,689
beautifully you like to see them version
of that one

1180
00:52:25,689 --> 00:52:28,428
issues not mob boss issue somewhat

1181
00:52:28,429 --> 00:52:32,279
and there is more must is to be has been
a minimum for a long time

1182
00:52:32,279 --> 00:52:34,339
but they still use the same one box

1183
00:52:34,339 --> 00:52:35,189
and his

1184
00:52:35,189 --> 00:52:36,969
off-base onepass

1185
00:52:36,969 --> 00:52:40,169
permanently

1186
00:52:40,169 --> 00:52:42,749
and uh... we've heard before about

1187
00:52:42,749 --> 00:52:46,319
problem since margaret problems electric
meters

1188
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:49,219
suffolk dot on interest i try to

1189
00:52:49,219 --> 00:52:51,619
about partners about

1190
00:52:51,619 --> 00:52:55,849
acquires paint style

1191
00:52:55,849 --> 00:52:59,119
what do these things scare you i mean is
this something that you

1192
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,749
are worried about raving about this i
mean it's always carry some content

1193
00:53:02,749 --> 00:53:03,569
providers

1194
00:53:03,569 --> 00:53:08,619
in the meter aspect of the meters thats
really scary of course

1195
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:13,109
not really at least luckily for us here
in scandinavia and saying that

1196
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:15,499
usually we don't use power

1197
00:53:15,499 --> 00:53:18,859
the the meters her want to see if we
have regulations of the things we in

1198
00:53:18,859 --> 00:53:19,828
that

1199
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:20,849
and

1200
00:53:20,849 --> 00:53:24,929
freedom but to keep to the companies
need to give us acceptance based on what

1201
00:53:24,929 --> 00:53:25,859
could use

1202
00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:29,459
the only difference is actually give us
bills which

1203
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:32,279
and measure the except mona usage

1204
00:53:32,279 --> 00:53:32,990
s

1205
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:36,618
to not to have people running around
your house every month to check to me at

1206
00:53:36,619 --> 00:53:38,229
present the expensive

1207
00:53:38,229 --> 00:53:40,459
to ever in the midst in these

1208
00:53:40,459 --> 00:53:45,448
anymore automatic meter reading devices

1209
00:53:45,449 --> 00:53:50,049
unit but because of the scriptures and
they'd like to and

1210
00:53:50,049 --> 00:53:52,909
to business listing brenda's estimated
measures dot

1211
00:53:52,909 --> 00:53:55,779
so these anymore devices are usually

1212
00:53:55,779 --> 00:53:58,779
only connected to order billing system

1213
00:53:58,779 --> 00:54:00,299
and uh...

1214
00:54:00,299 --> 00:54:04,309
which means the worst thing that could
happen if you get a virus that's better

1215
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:09,509
as that yesterday you might be might
might not be able to build it correctly

1216
00:54:09,509 --> 00:54:13,680
they cannot control anything about this
long relay which they can set up to par

1217
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,480
personal communication with your washing
machine or your

1218
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,729
condition

1219
00:54:17,729 --> 00:54:20,678
uh... and this is what i think we need

1220
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:22,769
makes me sleep better at night

1221
00:54:22,769 --> 00:54:25,439
her buyers would actually benefit
because

1222
00:54:25,439 --> 00:54:27,209
the last

1223
00:54:27,209 --> 00:54:27,899
let me know

1224
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:30,479
they weren't going to be less but

1225
00:54:30,479 --> 00:54:34,700
rehearsals and detailing acceptable
infrastructure so i can in fact but

1226
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:37,259
and nothing i actually is that also is
that

1227
00:54:37,259 --> 00:54:38,269
and

1228
00:54:38,269 --> 00:54:41,479
exit button sweden and finland hadn't
hadn't blown off

1229
00:54:41,479 --> 00:54:44,989
uh... seven arnet between what we we
might warranties and that will continue

1230
00:54:44,989 --> 00:54:48,639
networks so therefore most of our
communication

1231
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:52,750
actually uses that obtain instead wendy
messing around and

1232
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:55,629
peace mission it hurts like thing that
works with the car

1233
00:54:55,629 --> 00:54:59,279
and amend this agreement there so much
he sits as well by author

1234
00:54:59,279 --> 00:55:01,119
are part of just who get up and visit

1235
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,109
had become a new life in the network

1236
00:55:03,109 --> 00:55:04,919
wireless internet works either

1237
00:55:04,919 --> 00:55:07,808
harder taxes

1238
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:10,959
and some class everybody else so far i
mean what what

1239
00:55:10,959 --> 00:55:13,448
what you think of the biggest
misconceptions

1240
00:55:13,449 --> 00:55:14,640
in embedded

1241
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,138
securities

1242
00:55:16,139 --> 00:55:20,509
i'd say uh... big conception policies
will cripple infrastructure

1243
00:55:20,509 --> 00:55:25,829
people only see what's involved in
what's the cvs in the computers tuesday

1244
00:55:25,829 --> 00:55:27,299
have wonderful

1245
00:55:27,299 --> 00:55:31,169
but they don't realize that recently on
this is a problem this is sort of a

1246
00:55:31,169 --> 00:55:35,299
and computer it's on software and
personal important function what they

1247
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:36,859
don't realize is that bad

1248
00:55:36,859 --> 00:55:38,190
hundred times more

1249
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:39,480
embedded devices

1250
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:44,219
in up almost enough control systems
which they never see

1251
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:47,029
their although we're and uh...

1252
00:55:47,029 --> 00:55:52,439
rallying more very important

1253
00:55:52,439 --> 00:55:56,919
many questions from the audience

1254
00:55:56,919 --> 00:56:00,709
the quick example

1255
00:56:00,709 --> 00:56:03,308
everything you're not able to go and
detail

1256
00:56:03,309 --> 00:56:05,940
buttercup friday traffic like controller

1257
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:07,439
and tennessee

1258
00:56:07,439 --> 00:56:09,649
running the export

1259
00:56:09,649 --> 00:56:12,169
uh... a lot

1260
00:56:12,169 --> 00:56:17,049
the manufacture with shipping
development version of the ex works

1261
00:56:17,049 --> 00:56:20,819
instead of actually purchasing it

1262
00:56:20,819 --> 00:56:23,749
because of this included for the bugging
symbols because he didn't have the

1263
00:56:23,749 --> 00:56:28,069
authority to released a version of the
software without them

1264
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:32,119
not only that but the traveler
controllers controlled by s_ and p_ and

1265
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:33,849
buy a p p

1266
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:38,209
and you've worked with either you can
guess that the accident team read only

1267
00:56:38,209 --> 00:56:40,769
community word

1268
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:42,488
the s_ and p_ term for a password

1269
00:56:42,489 --> 00:56:43,480
was public

1270
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,559
and the rewrite password is private

1271
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,929
the administrative f ups ground

1272
00:56:48,929 --> 00:56:51,680
that username was anonymous and the
password will you

1273
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,038
we're in a lab rats

1274
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:55,379
hahahahaha

1275
00:56:55,379 --> 00:56:58,009
and

1276
00:56:58,009 --> 00:57:01,070
it

1277
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:05,609
cable loaded with rash liz in that case

1278
00:57:05,609 --> 00:57:07,190

at

1282
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:18,619
feel that it has

1283
00:57:18,619 --> 00:57:20,689
yeah at at at at at at

1284
00:57:20,689 --> 00:57:24,979
and what's interesting is that black
white and what was it that way mommy

1285
00:57:24,979 --> 00:57:28,140
the did manufactured

1286
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:31,259
you do built this system become did
nothing wrong because there's not a

1287
00:57:31,259 --> 00:57:33,319
problem nothing in their prime
inspection

1288
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:35,369
uh... from maine

1289
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:37,160
traffic light operator the speech

1290
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,819
maybe but the city

1291
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:43,489
uh... development requiring part of
security in the office system and

1292
00:57:43,489 --> 00:57:47,309
they didn't even configure reconfigured
for monthly mortgage

1293
00:57:47,309 --> 00:57:49,140
and uh... i think

1294
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,519
what's really needs

1295
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:53,169
what we needed spare

1296
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:54,399
and uh... that

1297
00:57:54,399 --> 00:57:55,589
better requirement

1298
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:57,249
when people our system

1299
00:57:57,249 --> 00:58:02,259
and also understand that you might have
to do some shinshin seven gentle once

1300
00:58:02,259 --> 00:58:03,839
you've bought the system

1301
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:05,199
company payment

1302
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:09,049
uh... salisbury available also you're
not allowed nadia

and guessing understand your question
had to spend

1309
00:58:40,849 --> 00:58:43,769
for most control system and scada system
people

1310
00:58:43,769 --> 00:58:44,819
you'd see that

1311
00:58:44,819 --> 00:58:48,269
daily stick to this case principal keep
it simple stupid

1312
00:58:48,269 --> 00:58:50,919
and it's really really good principle
because

1313
00:58:50,919 --> 00:58:55,799
once you get too much advanced soft
immediately specially logically pecs

1314
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:59,119
by a lot of security appliances in
person

1315
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,459
there's always a big risk you might lose
a little bit because of that

1316
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:09,459
critics

1317
00:59:22,949 --> 00:59:27,009
and i can say for four networks a chance
longhand it's usually a good idea to

1318
00:59:27,009 --> 00:59:27,989
uh...

1319
00:59:27,989 --> 00:59:31,740
have redundancy for dinner tonight have
been done network if it's really

1320
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:38,740
important cripple infrastructure

1321
00:59:44,369 --> 00:59:47,879
i don't have any more questions

1322
00:59:47,879 --> 00:59:52,999
uh... cleared to book which is an well
mario my understanding of very into

1323
00:59:52,999 --> 00:59:56,990
scada system plunged and there's like
two three major

1324
00:59:56,990 --> 01:00:01,118
suppliers so really big automation
system

1325
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:02,319
and ben

1326
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:04,869
at most of them are actually rhyming

1327
01:00:04,869 --> 01:00:08,639
the same software i mean they receive
ministers a_b_b_ and they responded to

1328
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:09,609
others

1329
01:00:09,609 --> 01:00:13,558
vendors but uh... mostly everyone's
running to siemens software to control

1330
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:15,049
them

1331
01:00:15,049 --> 01:00:21,538
add to that not the case and saddle but
something's everything your seniors are

1332
01:00:21,539 --> 01:00:23,109
probably from there

1333
01:00:23,109 --> 01:00:27,209
and some you know a lot of people who
like to use email software that i can

1334
01:00:27,209 --> 01:00:27,879
see

1335
01:00:27,879 --> 01:00:32,269
know if that's not in the case
especially u_s_ scenes are greedy in usd

1336
01:00:32,269 --> 01:00:33,118
about

1337
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,260
were

1338
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:37,699
allen bradley or them

1339
01:00:37,699 --> 01:00:40,499
uh... schreiner and a lot of other
vendors

1340
01:00:40,499 --> 01:00:41,618
and

1341
01:00:41,619 --> 01:00:47,079
and maybe bs i think in the east indians
you instance and europe

1342
01:00:47,079 --> 01:00:48,269
soon

1343
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:49,270
no i i

1344
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:53,430
i don't think i think actually appears
different systems both in the devices

1345
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:55,459
and also in the pc seller

1346
01:00:55,459 --> 01:00:58,029
and they're also vendors who do

1347
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:02,599
software forty human machine interface
is

1348
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:06,199
would go to end the budget so that that
there's

1349
01:01:06,199 --> 01:01:11,799
at least somewhere variety but on the
device level and yarn like states like a

1350
01:01:11,799 --> 01:01:16,269
handful of benders so they're not many
open

1351
01:01:16,269 --> 01:01:23,049
but at least peat marwick what you think
you can make it by voices official

1352
01:01:23,049 --> 01:01:25,288
reasonable people like this

1353
01:01:25,289 --> 01:01:28,940
uh... expiry victory factory u

1354
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:31,249
but by all reverses near it

1355
01:01:31,249 --> 01:01:33,839
they should have review really large

1356
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,220
the alleged

1357
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:38,379
elected accident

1358
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:41,469
and and and this of course the risk
uh...

1359
01:01:41,469 --> 01:01:42,820
that i think that's a

1360
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:45,700
if someone get access to your control
system the group

1361
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:50,669
where you have your pc's their scrutiny
religious co-director of the traffic and

1362
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:53,229
you wanted to do anything anyway

1363
01:01:53,229 --> 01:01:56,729
head exicted primitive security is the
better

1364
01:01:56,729 --> 01:02:03,729
is the good solution to a big just make
sure that they don't even get that far

1365
01:02:03,809 --> 01:02:07,849
factory have anymore questions all

1366
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,989
you uh... tickets today

1367
01:02:09,989 --> 01:02:12,419
people really shouldn't use as a cell

1368
01:02:12,419 --> 01:02:15,519
and then at the same time you also
advocate

1369
01:02:15,519 --> 01:02:19,229
network monitoring but it's getting love
the devices are bad

1370
01:02:19,229 --> 01:02:23,569
and you also advocate for having
integrity and some kind of

1371
01:02:23,569 --> 01:02:29,089
confidentiality like for example
stronger medication week like that

1372
01:02:29,089 --> 01:02:33,308
it seems like with all of these devices
simply supported a cell and do the

1373
01:02:33,309 --> 01:02:35,209
legitimate administrator

1374
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:39,868
put all the keys together with something
like wire tranfer

1375
01:02:39,869 --> 01:02:42,909
you can see all the content because you
can't her at all

1376
01:02:42,909 --> 01:02:45,219
and at the same time

1377
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:47,119
it seems like it was actually

1378
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:48,939
provide a lot

1379
01:02:48,939 --> 01:02:53,828
for example if you have to be able to
make uh... mutually authenticated

1380
01:02:53,829 --> 01:02:55,529
with client-side certificate

1381
01:02:55,529 --> 01:02:57,669
uh... connection tissue man

1382
01:02:57,669 --> 01:03:01,919
means just getting access to the
networking or doesn't make it game

1383
01:03:01,919 --> 01:03:05,749
and it also seems to be the case that it
would generally improved the security of

1384
01:03:05,749 --> 01:03:10,328
all the stuff talk about that

1385
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:11,790
the and influence

1386
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:13,409
and

1387
01:03:13,409 --> 01:03:18,109
actually i i'm not saying it isn't that
many and and using it

1388
01:03:18,109 --> 01:03:20,149
not necessary itself

1389
01:03:20,149 --> 01:03:21,989
confidentiality but me

1390
01:03:21,989 --> 01:03:25,869
unification needed investment interest
on the other side

1391
01:03:25,869 --> 01:03:30,139
if the user so that's one solution and
it might prevent you from doing that yes

1392
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:34,379
for example

1393
01:03:34,379 --> 01:03:39,709
yeah it will carry out and touch some
give some benefits for you

1394
01:03:39,709 --> 01:03:40,379
and

1395
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:43,609
a lot of these devices aren't really
coming ok

1396
01:03:43,609 --> 01:03:46,279
some s_l_ encryption isn't really having
to do

1397
01:03:46,279 --> 01:03:47,439
but

1398
01:03:47,439 --> 01:03:50,370
sometimes you really want to have been
and soon

1399
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:53,649
and cebu requirements as possible

1400
01:03:53,649 --> 01:03:57,439
in some cases i would think it's not
just to have good authentication

1401
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:02,489
and with some internet or something like
the each message

1402
01:04:02,489 --> 01:04:06,749
so repair and use introduced for
overkill

1403
01:04:06,749 --> 01:04:11,769
there's not much room teasing encryption

1404
01:04:11,769 --> 01:04:13,209
i think equity

1405
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:18,229
primary benefits uh... that if you are
encouraging people but network capstone

1406
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:21,519
i think that they concede all of the day
that they can potentially compromise the

1407
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:22,589
network

1408
01:04:22,589 --> 01:04:26,189
and so even with charter indication if
you presume that you have uh... republic

1409
01:04:26,189 --> 01:04:28,138
at the replayed

1410
01:04:28,139 --> 01:04:29,799
just guessing is not the case

1411
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:31,849
but if you somehow have that

1412
01:04:31,849 --> 01:04:34,559
it seems like this would at least stop
it

1413
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,859
such situated even when you're sniffing
the network you really don't get

1414
01:04:37,859 --> 01:04:41,259
anything unless you've pretty much on
the whole networking have all the key

1415
01:04:41,259 --> 01:04:43,319
king

1416
01:04:43,319 --> 01:04:45,129
it seems like that would be

1417
01:04:45,129 --> 01:04:48,979
like a really useful thing but i wonder
if you actually seen devices that can do

1418
01:04:48,979 --> 01:04:52,308
the actual certificate authentication in
the field

1419
01:04:52,309 --> 01:04:56,760
this justly notices described as i
mentioned in her raoul

1420
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,540
at an interaction scenes and the vice

1421
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:02,529
which extend american standards would be
to properly orchestra have been working

1422
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:03,089
with

1423
01:05:03,089 --> 01:05:06,759
skating control system for one-half your
soul

1424
01:05:06,759 --> 01:05:09,229
stock market my happens and since then

1425
01:05:09,229 --> 01:05:10,428
there too

1426
01:05:10,429 --> 01:05:11,849
no it's just

1427
01:05:11,849 --> 01:05:15,239
mostly just clear texts for
entrepreneurs

1428
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:21,449
overthrew and to be very slim simple
protocols

1429
01:05:21,449 --> 01:05:23,979
the big problem areas legacy

1430
01:05:23,979 --> 01:05:28,019
i mean you also talk about when things
are put in place

1431
01:05:28,019 --> 01:05:29,479
lived for twenty years

1432
01:05:29,479 --> 01:05:32,749
and we've seen three things in the field
now that have lived for like fifteen or

1433
01:05:32,749 --> 01:05:33,879
twenty years

1434
01:05:33,879 --> 01:05:37,259
you will never ever see anything like
meso or is this

1435
01:05:37,259 --> 01:05:38,729
bitchy and uh...

1436
01:05:38,729 --> 01:05:41,948
there are still running on a pretty even
things like that

1437
01:05:41,949 --> 01:05:46,329
so if it will be like one day in future
when someone is reporting to complete

1438
01:05:46,329 --> 01:05:48,149
plant something like that

1439
01:05:48,149 --> 01:05:50,319
we might see things like that

1440
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:54,629
the vendors are hysterically afraid of
anything that could had an impact on

1441
01:05:54,629 --> 01:05:57,339
four months or number footprints

1442
01:05:57,339 --> 01:05:59,109
i mean various eyepiece by

1443
01:05:59,109 --> 01:06:02,999
there's a long long way to go before
there to see something in reality

1444
01:06:02,999 --> 01:06:05,538
to actually having a protection in place

1445
01:06:05,539 --> 01:06:09,339
and one of three when you said today to
when we do testing with two fussing with

1446
01:06:09,339 --> 01:06:10,549
two oldest tough

1447
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:14,509
we see something collection might
distract or operating system

1448
01:06:14,509 --> 01:06:16,319
seems to be okay

1449
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:19,509
the problem has been five years five
when someone coming up with the new

1450
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:20,659
attack

1451
01:06:20,659 --> 01:06:23,189
defender will not be around actually

1452
01:06:23,189 --> 01:06:26,719
because the fender has discontinued its
product line what they have gone on to

1453
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:31,099
business will be important by one oh two
become predicted to be seems to

1454
01:06:31,099 --> 01:06:32,339
something that uh...

1455
01:06:32,339 --> 01:06:35,649
so we'll see if they were told the white
attempt to change

1456
01:06:35,649 --> 01:06:36,979
width with a bike

1457
01:06:36,979 --> 01:06:40,549
that wasn't the problem fighters backed
by someone come up with something you

1458
01:06:40,549 --> 01:06:43,849
looks looks tessa whatever but what
about you

1459
01:06:43,849 --> 01:06:45,599
bede-ten changed

1460
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:47,379
even if they have coming

1461
01:06:47,379 --> 01:06:50,868
if you have to do some action postage
someplace and complextype

1462
01:06:50,869 --> 01:06:53,369
but as part of a problem with this
infrastructure

1463
01:06:53,369 --> 01:06:55,249
and also the schedule things

1464
01:06:55,249 --> 01:06:59,149
if you have a chameleon a more systems

1465
01:06:59,149 --> 01:07:05,180
there's a whole problem to try to talk
that that

1466
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:10,719
discussing the ads t_v_

1467
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:13,179
but it is always a problem

1468
01:07:13,179 --> 01:07:18,859
uh... that we are anymore

1469
01:07:18,859 --> 01:07:25,859
all right thank you very much

1470
01:07:26,869 --> 01:07:31,159
and it says that the next talk is
anti-democrat

1471
01:07:31,159 --> 01:07:33,199
sold for thirty years no you back
