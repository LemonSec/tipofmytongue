1
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,619
documentary about uh...

2
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:11,419
opinion at the back

3
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:13,469
so thanks time here

4
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:16,698
um without talking on something that
prob commencement

5
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:18,400
corner it's killing dixon

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,330
i'm pretty sure everybody ball and
offensive the problem it's just

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,179
something which has existed for

8
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:26,119
for twenty years resources

9
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:29,719
there were and interpretations there was
something quite a sequel injection

10
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,149
and discuss this is a problem which is

11
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:36,310
probably wednesday by the previous

12
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,560
a little bit about uh... myself

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,800
uh... edit before i start uh... upgrade
a few changes so

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,140
what i'm trying to

15
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,260
what i idol as something delivered
ambitious

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,660
uh... but was on my bed was

17
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,730
so i'll put up what set on setup uh...
with all these

18
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,889
remember these

19
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,199
and i tried to exploit it

20
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,400
when im while i'm here

21
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,190
undoubtedly that everything look
mckinsey wattleton what government does

22
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,649
not work

23
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,730
so a little bit about me

24
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,240
outlook as uh... senior security
something

25
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,160
uh... act

26
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,550
at a company or seven state in ukraine

27
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,320
of england as for

28
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,889
more than four years now and it's
interesting

29
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,880
i've spoken about u conferences

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,830
uh... and this is an oblong noxious
kilgore calm

31
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:31,179
it actually might be able to secure two
hundred package

32
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,950
uh... but i've posted some stuff well
ahead

33
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,970
motivated to replications because that's
my

34
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,410
uh... idia

35
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,640
uh... and generally focusing on sickle
injections

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,420
so i'll put a lot of slides

37
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,320
uh...

38
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,410
ut i hoped i would have lots of flights

39
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,619
out buying the right thing about last
night

40
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:54,670
and then i woke up this morning thinking
assured a packed one lesbian

41
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:55,869
so

42
00:01:55,869 --> 00:02:00,360
uh... anyways the demos open should work
and did that they should make up for the

43
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,940
sites

44
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,680
so what's the addendum were connected
and ordered a is broadly on exporting

45
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,999
sequel injections

46
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:13,910
uh... i'd be focusing many agree that
missus mssql

47
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,259
and oracle

48
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:18,880
uh... a quick shop and sell who any
garment go ahead

49
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,059
actually what the lord bill like
deviates or developers

50
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:27,829
then diving a stocking cap and it's
going to get away with it

51
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:30,989
uh... they there's one more day

52
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:35,339
anyway so i i i mean broadly coating
coatings uh... uncovering barely

53
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:36,370
escalation

54
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,140
so you're going to see clinician

55
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,480
and then you find that the connection
string is not great at least so you

56
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,660
initiate you wanted to get interested in

57
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,769
setting usernames and a diesel evans
what's been said

58
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:49,489
so you do something something
investigations

59
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:52,420
and broadly i would be covering westwood
execution

60
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,040
so you find fecal injection how can you
then run westward execution

61
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,108
com

62
00:02:58,109 --> 00:02:59,390
whatever law court

63
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,309
is uh...

64
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,999
or i would have

65
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:04,810
love to produce more above the end of
the time

66
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,130
is data extraction

67
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,160
uh... there have been quite a few is an
advancement like uh... extracting nato

68
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,668
in the midst

69
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:14,430
this is something about it as a although
ben ten months

70
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,480
so you find sequined itching

71
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,059
people typically exploited using line
janice

72
00:03:22,059 --> 00:03:25,698
all recommend reading up insights from
the pontiff team

73
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:28,609
uh... about work they picked the heat
uh...

74
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:31,540
did a very good demo on alba brent
jenna's

75
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,149
and uh... laugh you have an off-color
any of my esculent

76
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:37,289
of mice here western

77
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:38,428
uh...

78
00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:39,799
for this i would recommend

79
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:42,299
beating up but i was uh... slights

80
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,449
which he presented in backpack amsterdam

81
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:48,329
uh... this year

82
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,260
so that's the subject

83
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,448
so uh... what are the sql injection i
don't think it needs an introduction

84
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:56,139
visited the uh...

85
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:57,540
it's overloaded the

86
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,149
uh... in which by the brochures and
sanitize jesus importante es que reports

87
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:03,259
uh...

88
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:06,749
and and look at what can you do if you
keep using this condition when it will

89
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:07,409
be

90
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:10,089
so that's an attacker you could
compromise uh... confidentiality

91
00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:12,319
integrity and availability

92
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,738
uh... student protests here

93
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:18,620
when we ship are beating confidentiality
what you mean

94
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,579
say purity dot restore a credit card
because

95
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,850
append

96
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,020
you could be done those who've gotten
permission that's uh... reached what

97
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,310
they've been shown to be

98
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,480
needs the excision of system for

99
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,580
which would mean that back in august
uh...

100
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,149
access on the twenty or d_m_z_ network
may be

101
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,450
and he denied that maybe your internal
components which you

102
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,779
tinku will be security but they are not
exposed or the internet

103
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:44,430
argued that in the eye better

104
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,310
so update database

105
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,309
statements and things like that

106
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:52,839
it i can be destroyed up to be an
example go big of a single people

107
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:56,060
so this at the beginning sample oval
office equal injection

108
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,369
well uh... with some people in a far as
or when people are going to back

109
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:02,989
uh... on below where it is uh...

110
00:05:02,989 --> 00:05:05,210
vindiction point is in the real growth

111
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,438
so you can get something like uh...

112
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,870
username is equal to a single day

113
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,280
or when a good one

114
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,750
soliciting part of the quake or when it
would be one

115
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,379
is always true added had done some
records from the

116
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:20,060
from people from from that was in kuwait

117
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,240
and then you do something but i thought
i could

118
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,280
which is a common india sqlserver

119
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,109
and you come in balboa support

120
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,729
or logic

121
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:31,159
put up with this is uh...

122
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:32,248
uh...

123
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,519
but if you get exempted

124
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,699
of civilian ditions and by putting it in
the kitchen

125
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:37,860
it brody

126
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,880
does not exist anymore because all of
these instances have already been

127
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,780
compromised

128
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,859
but somebody

129
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,869
uh... and they must have learned the
lessons

130
00:05:46,869 --> 00:05:49,069
uh... selects yes uh...

131
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:50,699
his character and steady

132
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:53,680
let's go back to describe to the days of
nineteen nineties

133
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,380
when uh... use some distinguished
pianist with cnbc

134
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,749
poster depicting

135
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:01,080
uh... source the stored procedure

136
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,469
this was uh...

137
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:04,849
this fuss or procedure and mssql

138
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:07,619
uh... schisms escort the continental
flight

139
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:10,239
but let's start with them a sister who
called in

140
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:13,169
so it was stored procedures which was
uh... a miliband

141
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:14,539
esculent there were

142
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:17,889
uh... typically distort procedure will
only be a really

143
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:22,039
wilbur ingesting the road to seven

144
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:23,539
if you buy a sequel injection

145
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:25,009
the disadvantages

146
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,339
or sys admin privileges

147
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:30,719
then you have access to six p
underscores the ambition procedure

148
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:32,248
and a circus hearing

149
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:33,690
just let you know

150
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,110
westward example morse code and a more
books

151
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,300
and you compromise that it would be the
resourced

152
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,229
boeing symbol evidence

153
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:42,169
now

154
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:43,068
uh...

155
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:43,880
the callous

156
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,550
safety and security westport moving
experience for c_m_v_ ship

157
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,530
then up

158
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,589
under most of the uh... places you would
want to end the company conducted ship

159
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:53,799
so irene

160
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:57,318
dealers would be at work to do this it
is uh...

161
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:00,020
certain return was blocks to seek
whatever

162
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,639
it without the of t_v_ guide fifty of
t_v_ guide is installed

163
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,789
illegally on windows installation

164
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:07,690
so you're gonna get to be sober

165
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,329
that give tv so uh... we turned on at
that

166
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:11,499
binary

167
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:14,639
uh... using i_t_n_ experience within the
ship

168
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,580
you make up

169
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:20,008
the gringos database forced an executive
he's a word

170
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:22,589
uh... makingdollars naked body xy

171
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:26,949
went it hasn't been aur kisi just run it
and get a worship

172
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:28,729
okay uh...

173
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:29,800
simple evidence

174
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,400
now there are a few modern vehicles are
ob of their not

175
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,339
about that's what bill is s equalling
dept

176
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:40,039
richa rich does not rule out the
activities that were because

177
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:41,199
uh...

178
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,800
fortress for this to work with that one

179
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,849
jenny active t_b_ but on the books

180
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:49,688
which is generally is is available but
in some cases maybe they're it does not

181
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:50,469
have a live in

182
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:54,889
the second the most important

183
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:58,990
drawback of this is that today dot i
said i would need to set up result all

184
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,279
your public ivy

185
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,329
so it needs to have the out one now
interconnection public attention one new

186
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:06,129
york ny a few people work

187
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:10,370
when she would say mean so distinctively
approaches or the need for group

188
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,419
and uh... became quite uh...
micro-blogging spin cases

189
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:16,198
uh... so

190
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,050
sick women job actually

191
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,189
applauds this uh... naked body xi'an
netbox

192
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:22,879
uh... choosing

193
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,150
using annapolis

194
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,378
symbolize

195
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,249
uh... popping activity exceed

196
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:28,490
by many as text

197
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,670
inboard entity even in the database

198
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,669
and then booking at gamh out onto a
local fight

199
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:36,640
so it doesn't actually need any album
connections you can just do

200
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,640
abide by the poppy of defied and have
the fight on the books

201
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,630
okay todd the demo descended a bit later
because i want to

202
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,040
called for the next light

203
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,319
because uh... obligated des moines
signals are working for the invite

204
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,040
so cyclical it probably was quite a bit

205
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,010
bicycling injection

206
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:02,540
again with something

207
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,290
the main point overdose etc

208
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,819
uh...

209
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,730
felt sympathetic and loving

210
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,150
if you find a connection if you find a
sequel injection without the use of

211
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:15,800
essay or organically privileges and have
exit strategy and vision

212
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,358
is spared simple it's game or because

213
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:22,880
the portraiture obviously be redone as
per the privileges of system user

214
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,939
that's the interest rates the secret of
our process

215
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,299
so if you find

216
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:28,939
this condition

217
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,900
with this agreement is minutes invalid
tuesday more

218
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,569
but what if you are sequel your
injection point is it

219
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,860
lockerbie coverages and as a user

220
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,930
so opera go ahead

221
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,599
uh... this is a simple elastic
litigation genting i don't

222
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,810
or other somebody who's okay

223
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,560
if a person of the d_n_a_

224
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,750
use it for

225
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,170
just returns the ccleaner beginning to
seek an injunction here

226
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,709
well well

227
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,940
this this is a

228
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,720
or did the error messages that enabled

229
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,160
uh... andy

230
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,868
think what actually goes into and indeed
indeed

231
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:11,240
so i don't need to there was any single
explore or skip anything

232
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,410
so if i had

233
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,140
if i did was simply great interest to
underscore

234
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,800
user mc what user privileges

235
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,400
uh... i i'm going to have a mysql does

236
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,250
you'd see that this one pretty clearly
this is a

237
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,410
i'm reading mac experiments as use an
essay

238
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,650
which is a privileged user

239
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,800
and or had expedition is simple

240
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,719
i mean it was supposed to be showing
before cooler air speed

241
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,900
rejecting does look as if the reviews

242
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:44,170
certified the same thing go ahead

243
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,060
lucite

244
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,099
this is running up without username for
testing

245
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,050
and issues that he's actually ready and
at least user

246
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,300
it doesn't have access to excuse him be
shed

247
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,469
so if i did

248
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,790
mccracken execu ticks me into a c_m_v_
show here

249
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,920
so let's say if i do dvc

250
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,139
muster about

251
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:06,830
expereince more

252
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,270
cnb

253
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,600
chill

254
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,090
and then

255
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,640
lou dot com

256
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,089
so if this works which were really have
some time the leading cause of this

257
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:20,620
process to exit up including at least
like three seconds

258
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,420
what do you see in this case it doesn't
look

259
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,370
simply for the reason that online user
testing does not have access to exp cnb

260
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,090
ship

261
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,030
two decades

262
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,430
so uh...

263
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,959
estimates are compiled

264
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,860
uh... allows

265
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,780
or contact the court open research

266
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,999
so open if it is a feature to see if you
wanted to let we're

267
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:47,809
uh... annual appeal undercutting
database

268
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:51,579
democratic allows you who make a
connection to any more database

269
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,769
uh... fire equipment that it would be
the race

270
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:57,229
and whatever is the oprah dot that's why
the one that it would be various process

271
00:11:57,229 --> 00:12:00,200
that'll put in japan database

272
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,800
audit winner in the open or service
provided about the address

273
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,559
roy did a username and password

274
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,019
and even establish a connection to that
database

275
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,460
and and and yet waiting

276
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,379
so or that you see

277
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:14,910
of houston expo perot's technicals part
of the extn

278
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,240
uh... fluidity lead to the right was
uh... that's that's a constant thing

279
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,700
set the second part which is not in my
case

280
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,090
use this part of our hair

281
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,670
is is this is an f_b_i_ beatrice foods

282
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,140
uh... typewriter is the username

283
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,480
the fourth part of the popular

284
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,410
that in the next part is that way that
you want to execute

285
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,829
on that it would box

286
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,100
these open rustic feature or what you
can do is then

287
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,920
make that connect walk toward a more
database but nick said

288
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,349
and in a process boarded a username and
password

289
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,939
what you're doing and what is at the
same chili brute forcing organising

290
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,180
uh... possibly for political

291
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,979
and it just looks

292
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,279
japan actually had a the extent of
course the ambition

293
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:06,130
on the same both uh... repeat privileges
that you're just back

294
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,220
uh... let's just go back to

295
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,450
our dental

296
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,200
i actually have a kitty care

297
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:19,200
that myself and getting it right

298
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,180
so

299
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,989
in our injection let's try to use the
opener listed again and let's try to

300
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,160
guess the

301
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,959
uh... the essay popular optimal box and
if he successfully gets the essay

302
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:30,729
popular

303
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,939
uh... for the excuse of her own on on
this book

304
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:37,589
immunity the hearing plays with the
essay privileges

305
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,590
finessing the uh...

306
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,749
that's right he's an impressive
indestructible forecast

307
00:13:42,749 --> 00:13:46,079
and if he is uh... it disconnection six
successful

308
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,589
then it will go that way

309
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:51,310
which is uh... physically select one
quad and eight forty two thirty seconds

310
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,099
so i think judy it's it's a copy
declining diction

311
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,810
and i have to uproot forested

312
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,199
then you wanted to find out

313
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,880
username and password is correct

314
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,170
at the bottom respect and equality of
eight forty eight thirty seconds they

315
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,170
get executed

316
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,250
and many diverse over the next meeting
for thirty seconds

317
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,330
so so let's try it out

318
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,460
let's see what happens

319
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,790
you will find that in this case the
error messages out to be in ever run

320
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,219
that both so it

321
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,580
fifty-five authorities thought that i
could learn that benefit

322
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,150
but the authentication pin for
university

323
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,939
but uh... the fact that scenario is
actually very you invent the

324
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,500
uh... did everything interest is the law
anywhere

325
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,229
so you can actually see

326
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:33,589
whether the estimates one dated thirty
seconds or not to make out

327
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:36,850
even if it's about an injection

328
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,600
so if i if i had the same

329
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,689
because he just decided it did not great

335
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,079
but it uh...

336
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,149
required by this

337
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:02,529
or somebody give me some time before

00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,400
buying uh...

342
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,780
in this case back to me

343
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,390

344
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,689
i kept was very secure one this twenty
three

345
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,110

346
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:24,650
that exited stage making for uh... i
would like to receive any response

347

354
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,720
and uh... i mean if you live and work
forcing benefit actually allows you

355
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,000
be used for the sources of that it would
be better it

356
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,790
so you can use the computers in
baltimore deboer mr reported

357
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,150
and i think they're there

00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:58,459
somalia successfully safety awkward for

360
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,550
ambition

361
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,079
the problems from let's do that

362
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,350
so i'm not

363
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,040
radically amiss was the ambition

364
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:16,280
and make it through a divorce shed back

365
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,579
i would ask about face off a

366
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,379
alternating it connect with the if he'd
be settler and then

367
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:22,989
aborting an activity

368
00:16:22,989 --> 00:16:26,010

369
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,130
yes as you make it better than it
somehow

370
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,900
an independent easy is present on that
in the world

371
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,270
you can login area is coming in

372
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,210
and as it has already been compromised

373
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:42,210
at image his readiness to getting it too
late

374
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,359
so what we're going to overhead is that
we are at

375
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,069
we've got to go to class as deductive
reduced from the use of testing

376
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:54,420
leg of the

377
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,399
de w that essay and then operate has
successfully

378
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,019
connected with the aids epidemic is

379
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,920
then it will be executed extenders was
the emission

380
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,859
in this particular case he met the
binding at kentucky t is already present

381
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:11,449
on that uh... morbid obese people won't
be at in somalia's

382
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,850
so i feel like a approval to look at

383
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:20,929
uh...

384
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:27,930
appearance at the address

385
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:37,060
and without making an active listener
missing here

386
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,270
three providers in the news feed that
ufos disconnected activities

387
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,450
from testing is a discipline his
attorneys

388
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,660
and interested in it is going to have
access to xpc amnesia

389
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,429
animated whatever should

390
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:12,120
back to us

391
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,510
so at this point and i'll be back it has
a exited in the database

392
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,350
tradition from of most books

393
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,240
tapered overnight one thing

394
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,730
and stuff like that stand

395
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:26,220
uh... busy getting a storm but it would
be different

396
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,160
server

397
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,929
this is larry king started investing

398
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:38,640
things change in the rescuers have a
couple invite this box i was showing

399
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,789
uh... elasticity making it

400
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:42,200
act like it would have been what

401
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,270
as well actually able to fight books

402
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,009
and unqualified books

403
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:47,990
the escalator works are receding

404
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,740
does not run that system

405
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,510
it runs as netbook service

406
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,970
and issues and it looks elvis is
actually a limit to use it

407
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,950
you'd see in this particular case the
shed which i bought

408
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,610
if i grew up we arrived

409
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:05,270
uh... you can see right here at the back

410
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,940
so if i could fighting of limb i put you
up

411
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,059
unclaimed dependable invites people
don't invite allot the system on the

412
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,019
part of it

413
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,600
so it's a lot would be bored the hell
did that mean

414
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:22,600
that means that i haven't actually quite
restricted so if i tried to do

415
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,260
and like what

416
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,720
so excesses tonight

417
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,559
uh...

418
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:34,210
i mean on the card what was it was a
delays

419
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,429
uh...

420
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:39,140
so estimates dot let you get you can
reach some so starting fights on the

421
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,950
ball to conditions and almost like i
people in prison

422
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,169
and how if at all

423
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:45,740
you still have and now it would be the
end of the netbook

424
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,970
but this is not really

425
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,250
the at this point as it was important

426
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,550
in two thousand because

427
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,230
at the age of except setting a type of
service

428
00:19:54,230 --> 00:20:00,320
now uh... you over the celebrity mangoes
court prevented mapping

429
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,460
and that's what i am

430
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,130
uh...

431
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:07,850
i think that that members of her

432
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,490
today an estimate on i want to hear that
one

433
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,330
objectives was busy at the escalation in
those

434
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,850
which in use today and asking if you are
produced from the book service

435
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,010
that our system

436
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,210
uh... i don't know frankly understand
that we never did

437
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,550
uh... ready ready

438
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,519
bipartisan in terms of the person
pondered is uh...

439
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:28,750
if you get banned for technical term is

440
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,610
you can run toward a system

441
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:34,919
uh... disliked by the fixed bottom but
microsoft it during those your day for

442
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,080
like three four months

443
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,220
and then it was six democrats often

444
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,680
uh... i get to see it was fixed up but i
was when i go into

445
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,860
so it is this what is still worry about

446
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,209
and uh... it has to exploit again

447
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,759
uh... you have to prospects look into
this book

448
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:52,810
but the for the proposal demonstration
this is as you

449
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,730
is exporting already there

450
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,450
export is fairly simple

451
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,120
the export data to be a system one can
go out and it really that system

452
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:10,120
so if i guess to

453
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,090
unpardonable my remarks them ceases

454
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,840
carmen signature stamp

455
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:26,840
so if i did not know are

456
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,710
it is the largest incomplete and not
quite attentions on the book

457
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,910
there is a good on the ropes course
victory

458
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,580
so doggedly discussions if possible

459
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,309
with uh... the open or sixty misstated
the privileges of

460
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,540
of the abusing the connection string

461
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,658
and then secondly

462
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:58,010
after vp indictment director should be
phone it was going to do

463
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:01,249
the network service only continues to
bring that to me that's the reason

464
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:02,760
from its use here good at

465
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,900
netbook service fanatic system

466
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,429
at this point in time you've completely
on the slopes

467
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:09,990
uh... you watch the stinger missiles and

468
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,840
we would boost up late

469
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,810
passed down

470
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:14,529
policy has

471
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:17,110
his views the box you have to get once
you have the hatches

472
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,810
and the fun part starts from there

473
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,570
and yours

474
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,299
saurabh

475
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:28,908
if if there are any questions feel free
to lobby you know uh... often now

476
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:31,399
the persian the distinction and see

477
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:33,770
against iraq

478
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:40,220
uh...

479
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,429
aka and fight

480
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:45,159
extenders were cmd shell is december
twenty four

481
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:48,140
but if you have received the religious
you've been in a minute so it's just

482
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,929
uh... one line of code which used to say

483
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:53,070
estimates were configured and in that

484
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:56,950
magnetism but i'm going to take and
isn't it with xpc mission

485
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,590
uh... bitterness

486
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:02,510
that you don't even know if u if you had
the privileges which is typically the

487
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,070
essay or sysadmin

488
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,169
manages

489
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,889
you know that the other problem it
couldn't find is that

490
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:11,389
but there was a good part of a living by
default

491
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,150
so uh...

492
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,880
safe you find a sequel injection

493
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,210
and your connection string but does not
have a privileged user

494
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,490
january struck

495
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,850
nobody privileges of the current user

496
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:26,230
there's not much you can do

497
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:30,360
so so lets up you could aficionados read
and stuff

498
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,179
you've ended

499
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:36,309
the connection string uh... being and
that's been used is that

500
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:37,330
sometimes

501
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,480
then uh... been

502
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,740
local administrators or system us but
system administrators configure

503
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,850
yes kilter works on this aging

504
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,070
they're going to get it to run verdict
the results were

505
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,629
an open or domain administrators

506
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:55,320
that process does not go into the key
witnesses all system or network service

507
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,809
address to the privileges of domains
that wouldn't solve it

508
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:00,870
but what i mean by that is

509
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:07,870
if you actually put them back illicit
lutheran sourceoecd reported

510
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:14,880
yet this person who would have put a
sequel to our experts are nationhood

511
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,539
uh...

512
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:20,779
so sometimes uh... d

513
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:24,950
the administer some administrators back
to you don't forget seeing

514
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:28,150
meets up some technical since it opened
in april to miss

515
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:30,060
uh... overhead they would have

516
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:34,429
and locally administered in order to
minister farrakhan

517
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:38,110
nine those cases what can you do is

518
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,959
you can make this has to go through it

519
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,059
connect the art person be shared

520
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:46,059
uh... make this goes over followed the
and get them

521
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:48,960
dot and response there is a mere ten
division works

522
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,670
to send it up recalculated and get them
jennings

523
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:58,670
and whatever is what it sends it and
then go forty

524
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,070
and use them as well

525
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:08,760
yet so you can send and attended and in
tennis balls

526
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,210
whatever is going to get in and then try
to

527
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,230
crackpots were based on that

528
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,940
i will be given this

529
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:21,940
if before i uh... cougars

530
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:27,940
they were disguised

531
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,480
dividing this disney this is basically
unwanted children does

532
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,950
since uh... something with the
registered ever since he was came into

533
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:34,860
existence

534
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:39,020
at this critical if you're not going to
to governor mccollum and you practically

535
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,429
regular membership

536
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:44,330
then bring those reading that you have
an account one pebble as well

537
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,860
and we're back to work in the gay the
different problems intentions

538
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,889
and in the process and occupant

539
00:25:49,889 --> 00:25:53,530
here is a great ride a response to the
end respond again given seventy

540
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,830
the different popular

541
00:25:54,830 --> 00:26:01,100
and this is the one i repeat

542
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,340
today so i haven't

543
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:09,340
obedient borders

544
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:26,889
okay so it's a sustained escalating
tension at the moment at partner dot com

545
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:30,320
to what had what i need more time in
machines before the street map and i

546
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,240
need it

547
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,450
somebody point in time and then somebody
who can

548
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:35,519
respond to it

549
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:37,450
but is the same personal indiagen

550
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:42,250
so what i do not believe what i'm doing
the swedish posturing agency conviction

551
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,740
diminished skippers these things

552
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,800
and and uh... i don't really want him
and it's a sequel to a different place

553
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,639
and then

554
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,909
and i'm sure what the cockpit and users

555
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:56,580
and apparently there would be

556
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,419
but apparently the what the issues that

557
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,149
and then started note that in fact
writing

558
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:05,258
uh... that people don't blame you
interesting is not privileged people in

559
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:06,020
who much

560
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,820
when was it is not available

561
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:15,820
then or not

562
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:24,570
but mister willaby esculent a region
must be configured to run as

563
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,070
uh... sunset a column

564
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:29,740
uh... an organ donor book service or
system

565
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,830
so then in the about that's what i have
a pain running a legit

566
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:36,649
uh... which are configured buddhist

567
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,929
uh...

568
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:41,990
so i i don't think been

569
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:46,010
the sequel indigent hi-fi estore
procedure called extn escort you had to

570
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:49,879
be but this preceded his every word of

00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,740
who grew up

581
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:22,770
i have court beach the indian and gender
split entry now and i can see that

582
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:28,160
the connection from the remote database
much solar was as a user according to

583
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
straighter

584
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,200
the other day kitchen table and of
course it was a picture of intestine

585
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,260
correct

586
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,908
now i can don't understand it back
because

587
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:42,470
the seven percent was was begun to
anyone

588
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:49,470
if i

589
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,510
and you will be certified

590
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:59,059
when you see the boss rate because
already dragons a_b_c_ would be three

591
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:01,620
all the law restricted of the same use
them

592
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:06,090
it might still be setting a good
pictures which you can use

593
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,570
but this was one of them

594
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,120
now uh...

595
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,030
member

596
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:13,940
the bruno sesame defection of acts

597
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:17,630
anyway if any of the windows uh... as in
the defection of acts

598
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,429
image

599
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:21,399
uh... you so you basically to a man in
the murder rate

600
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:24,850
you you uh... telegenic in many parts of
town and all

601
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:28,330
you bandito is for the new bosses plans
on

602
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:31,669
but you can then you don't need to
practice practice attention even if they

603
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,549
can't act

604
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:35,889
u_k_ uh... you can use the same pakshe

605
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:39,230
got into a morbid events according to a
man would be most list

606
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,060
uh... so you can still use that

607
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,940
but what is it was fixed by a mystery to
a six eight

608
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,100
so the reflection of that does not work

609
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,070
apprentice or eight oh six eight

610
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:56,070
uh... mcdougal's impact the cash

611
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,600
okay son redundant mssql uh... a
person's head

612
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,939
the but i've gone through oracle

613
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,240
appeared

614
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,250
onto something just or to get started
playing um-hum blow

615
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,580
on what might be by banning

616
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,870
according to your t_v_ onto something
with it and i are called really

617
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,860
interesting

618
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,428
so but what i thought was a

619
00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:25,790
people have probable packing article

620
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,350
and people have been talking about it
since since last ten years maybe

621
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,780
i mean the likes of the real issue that
it's a grip on west they have disagreed

622
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:38,490
reported apart alene and select sold at
deadlocked on board a vote boorda

623
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,770
packing oracle

624
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,940
and a packet anymore

625
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,559
but it was a tremendous most of the box
on most of the papers even new york ny

626
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:46,629
hot guys handle

627
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,809
it got some old hakim boykin

628
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:50,860
antibodies from an advocate

629
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,169
so

630
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,340
uh...

631
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,928
so you get access to beginning to step
forward

632
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:58,050
and defender and amorphis

633
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:58,969
to packet

634
00:30:58,969 --> 00:31:02,500
for example going to back squat bagger
is an impossible

635
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,179
you enter into the database and and

636
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:07,800
the u_n_ some exploited began deviate

637
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,340
or typically appt

638
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,649
to adapt exploits

639
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,580
is good right

640
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,659
fine-tuned yahoo lists uh...

641
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,490
almost fights and stuff

642
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,460
so or candidates get embarrassed

643
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,810
how how do we

644
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,190
big hacking oracle

645
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,490
uh... from limitations

646
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,759
because began the

647
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,720
those uh... guinness hispanics whites
and stuff

648
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,030
really work on the internet look

649
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,870
so on top of the world

650
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:38,469
pecking order from that that includes ph
condition

651
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,480
had more than a provision that was

652
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,720
cheapening the action

653
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,170
westwood execution

654
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:46,940
and also some summits conditional

655
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,170
so uh...

656
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:52,309
supposed to be stopped

657
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:55,529
comes with a lot of stored procedures
and functions

658
00:31:55,529 --> 00:31:58,400
nomination locked

659
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,799
eileen keys are definitely hundreds if
not thousands

660
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,930
despite

661
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,330
uh... but the trouble is

662
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,379
people have called

663
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,049
on and number of wheeler-dealer uh... in
these

664
00:32:10,049 --> 00:32:12,100
defaults or procedures

665
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,779
the life that that

666
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:17,370
this is bad because these functions and
stored procedures

667
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,340
divide the fort

668
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:22,290
but what did you just got the defined it
and not being woken

669
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:25,990
so easy to independence is that the
welfare issue eighty votes

670
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,340
well by names like foster

671
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:31,120
often meet binaries so did and if you
would use of troops even though you had

672
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,949
to debate

673
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,630
so similarly these these functions and
for proceedings

674
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:37,850
uh... executed result did you find it

675
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:41,779
and in most cases thus the primaries of
any activities that

676
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:42,950
likes his

677
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,760
which typically i mean b_b_a_

678
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,710
is like like google and only next

679
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,220
t_v_a_ bb eight b

680
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:53,600
you've been in the database

681
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,889
it's not great approach in order for
procedure

682
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,929
admitted mortgage lady

683
00:32:57,929 --> 00:33:00,080
i mean uh... as an example

684
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,120
then you have to

685
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,739
explicit explicitly specified skewered

686
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,900
or already gotten worse when user

687
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,330
anderson this would mean that this for
procedure

688
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,570
on jim bernal reyna pretty privileges of
the more

689
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:14,550
and ordered up the define that

690
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,639
so um... inaction

691
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,700
if you find a sequel indigent

692
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,470
r_p_s_ could injection

693
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,259
under project these two

694
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:23,270
uh...

695
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,710
made in the next night

696
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,360
so if you find a sequel injection

697
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,369
in a pontoon

698
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:28,539
or procedure

699
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:32,059
which is owned by idealist user

700
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:34,110
it runs as i could meet you there

701
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,969
and whatever you do it

702
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:38,940
divested or be an issue with that rents

703
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,320
asset type of his user

704
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,928
celebrity in the spring

705
00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:43,170
uh...

706
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,899
in the sponsors of for procedures

707
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:46,020
if you can impact

708
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:49,310
opinion escalation

709
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,289
uh...

710
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:52,169
wondered about party

711
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:54,200
uh... order to injections

712
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,160
that typically competitive ease

713
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,910
uh... there's a p_m_s_ killing diction
what that would be an escalating tension

714
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,239
not be an estimated

715
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:04,620
now up to date

716
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,479
that set out on problem

717
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,340
obligor cycling rhetorical

718
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,740
so i think definition of p_m_s_ sqn is
uh... it sets

719
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:13,109
fingerprint like a free

720
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:14,598
helping chunk of court

721
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:17,709
which is uh... rapidly and begin and end
cost

722
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:21,089
so anything which was between begin and
end cost

723
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:22,009
if that is

724
00:34:22,009 --> 00:34:23,770
it's scored a structure of a sequel

725
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,199
you've got to be arrested

726
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,949
unless somebody other than the brunt of
the commission opportunism but the

727
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:30,389
definition

728
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:32,429
n_e_a_'s so

729
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:37,199
populistic appears to have is busy
developing and and and toss and then you

730
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,239
write some estimate

731
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:42,159
with that between these two beginning

732
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,049
or to get out sequined reduce a simple
sits in the past two employees like

733
00:34:46,049 --> 00:34:47,659
select start from

734
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:49,829
demanding

735
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:52,320
so uh... what i mean back the
enniskillen dictionaries

736
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,139
it's an injection in an anonymous
pianist who go up

737
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:57,189
uh...

738
00:34:57,189 --> 00:34:59,970
if you buy anything different animal
must be eschenbach

739
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:02,488
then detected no restrictions

740
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:04,010
uh... she could do

741
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:08,069
uber execute the amending the statements

742
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:09,079
uh...

743
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:11,920
you can and you can't reviewers inquiry

744
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,010
listen equal in

745
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,490
and then start a new body

746
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:17,288
just like in and just to answer

747
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:21,689
uh... however if your injection point
isn't is missing the sky sql statement

748
00:35:21,689 --> 00:35:24,169
like ascetic waiting

749
00:35:24,169 --> 00:35:26,189
denny s organizations

750
00:35:26,189 --> 00:35:30,149
oracle in those cases deluxe support the
use of semicolon

751
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:30,960
by design

752
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,310
she cannot stop tillers complete if your
injection is in the senate brady then

753
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,799
judy you have to

754
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,440
do everything in their cynically

755
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,460
he just aren't permitted to celebrity
and stardom instead or adopted obvious

756
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,599
flaws

757
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:45,800
so anyways

758
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,770
inaction illustrating diction

759
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,288
it's easy to exploit from rebecca's
perspective

760
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:54,479
a sequel indigenous likely difficult to
exploit

761
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:58,928
so activated example of t-sql injection
into ahead

762
00:35:58,929 --> 00:36:02,209
what happened the way that the attached
assembly procedure

763
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:04,939
order uh... horace also got best

764
00:36:04,939 --> 00:36:08,189
now or whether there is one of the
people are packages richard gephardt

765
00:36:08,189 --> 00:36:09,379
reinstall

766
00:36:09,379 --> 00:36:10,999
oracle applications on earth

767
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:15,649
sanitizing buchanan or department for
the moment

768
00:36:15,649 --> 00:36:19,449
so it's a piece of supposed to do it it
takes a paramedic work u

769
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:21,000
and expect it to you

770
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,880
is that what they're connected with the
stream

771
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,119
begin

772
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:29,210
so it basically then creates anonymous
pianist in prague

773
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,579
and that the money must be a lesbian law

774
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:35,009
then gets tend to be executed but it's
good to mediate

775
00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:37,939
reissued promises cured background

776
00:36:37,939 --> 00:36:41,428
then at the knees e-ticketing corporate
is like

777
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:45,089
it is a prepared statement but the
statement which is getting prepared

778
00:36:45,089 --> 00:36:47,889
you can actually control that part

779
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:50,610
if there's any artists you deployed a
statement

780
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,839
and ended with a prepared statement and
then it

781
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,459
so it's sort of having looked at

782
00:36:56,459 --> 00:36:59,408
c if you find d_c_-nine used in the
attack

783
00:36:59,409 --> 00:37:01,179
uh... is actually

784
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:03,019
making it

785
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:07,328
so i've typically happen would be
justice so you can pro-rate value of q

786
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:08,769
was equally do not

787
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:10,509
and and and you can be needed

788
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,869
that maybe people need

789
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:16,310
since when did you just pick described
in the vienna republic

790
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:22,219
sorry any databases are not going to be
a user

791
00:37:22,219 --> 00:37:23,799
i think so

792
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:25,160
i'm gonna show a little

793
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,299
example off

794
00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:29,369
video find pianist inundation

795
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:34,389
if you can't even find pianist glenn
injections inorder petitions artwork

796
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:36,369
now lol

797
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:38,700
well i think a displayed a sugar

798
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,589
retreat

799
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:40,400
beam

800
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,839
uh... she represented the slight like
ten years ago

801
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:43,730
by any means

802
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:48,559
apocalyptica chancellor has had a season
when the movies

803
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:50,150
this one is is that the gothic

804
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,399
maruti

805
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:54,509
uh... this almost

806
00:37:54,509 --> 00:37:57,639
but let me give a little bit of
background rhetorical applications of us

807
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,429
it's especially audit

808
00:37:59,429 --> 00:38:02,819
down to see you i would suspect
specially the oracle application server

809
00:38:02,819 --> 00:38:06,589
uh... because these spots of the first
part of the i host name or the idea

810
00:38:06,589 --> 00:38:07,310
dress

811
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,799
invited the port number

812
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:10,810
the typewriter is to start c_n_n_'s

813
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:15,259
is just the start of the bs could be a
great

814
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:16,770
that u_p_s_ belatedly

815
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,729
which connects to the north vietnamese

816
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:21,609
and then there's an application server

817
00:38:21,609 --> 00:38:25,459
dispute escalated rhetoric but it's a
little bit of a settler it needs to

818
00:38:25,459 --> 00:38:27,799
alternate episode was at the address

819
00:38:27,799 --> 00:38:31,649
it needs to know the connection string
like username and password

820
00:38:31,649 --> 00:38:34,979
so these things are saving something for
less

821
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,169
added up with excess descriptive fight

822
00:38:37,169 --> 00:38:39,638
what what points are tax plan

823
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:42,919
so despite pockets last year that's what
you see

824
00:38:42,919 --> 00:38:44,788
is typically the forest back

825
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:46,469
database access to skip that

826
00:38:46,469 --> 00:38:49,400
so if that's the pianist and gateway
that you should connect

827
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,199
and uh... it would be debited issues are

828
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:54,140
second part border style short form

829
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,709
italians has two parts

830
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:59,158
uh... the first part of this has
released the name of the package

831
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:00,970
so what essentially stands for

832
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,598
orchids in the title

833
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:05,269
and uh... holdings is the

834
00:39:05,269 --> 00:39:07,788
is the actual procedure to get one in
here

835
00:39:07,789 --> 00:39:11,219
so this thing is that this had a pianist
litigation we are pretty so you get

836
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:12,659
inject

837
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:17,009
you don't accept the esculent and that
we get executed

838
00:39:17,009 --> 00:39:18,179
and other companies

839
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:19,459
iterated executed

840
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:23,888
but uh... it started with a privileges
begun geyser

841
00:39:23,889 --> 00:39:28,479
rich in this case happens to be or taxes
or or articles in the finals there

842
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:30,319
and issues that is actually

843
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:31,699
buddy not

844
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:33,729
this this is a and is privileged user

845
00:39:33,729 --> 00:39:38,569
it does not even have manages to create
a function

846
00:39:38,569 --> 00:39:40,169
so uh...

847
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:43,149
sonar recorded lighting etc

848
00:39:43,149 --> 00:39:47,848
so what we can do is because you can't
executive bien estimate

849
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:51,899
then you can pull up the will editor
packages in the back and database

850
00:39:51,899 --> 00:39:56,239
annex like these packages and in any way
dr ladies

851
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:58,139
so

852
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:00,900
does this really needs to act the
backend database

853
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,459
has eleven packages

854
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:06,388
and tobacco nativism even even introduce
ah... even

855
00:40:06,389 --> 00:40:10,439
uh... curtailment that there are so many
liberties in the arctic back and did

856
00:40:10,439 --> 00:40:11,899
everything or kingston

857
00:40:11,899 --> 00:40:13,848
trying to fix them

858
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:18,559
so idoc something godless pointing out
that it's it's a simple bartlett

859
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:19,819
which exploits up

860
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:22,889
you're listening to remember d

861
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:26,439
if you have for the penis condition will
only be then it really

862
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:28,368
uh... launch

863
00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:29,739
a series of exploits

864
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:32,889
based on what backend database will
resume or harking back to me that if

865
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:35,389
you're using

866
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:37,359
once a is successful

867
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,919
that it will give you the bb abilities

868
00:40:40,919 --> 00:40:43,279
requesting it because we want to exports

869
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:44,729
and back in database

870
00:40:44,729 --> 00:40:47,288
if successfully issue to be via
privileges

871
00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:48,389
its axis was

872
00:40:48,389 --> 00:40:52,319
then it builds up without function which
relate to execute wistful

873
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,149
a symbol of that

874
00:40:54,149 --> 00:40:58,888
so

875
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:05,889
this is all

876
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:13,029
disallow and oracle application server
uh... likenesses dingy

877
00:41:13,029 --> 00:41:17,719
securities outing

878
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:24,719
based on that literary purists who knew

879
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:31,239
began began using a procedure called

880
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,669
wonderful you bill

881
00:41:33,669 --> 00:41:35,319
a package corleone rs when you've been

882
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:42,320
and andrew miga branched out

883
00:41:51,669 --> 00:41:54,910
so i'm gonna acrylic brand equity debt

884
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,799
same selected from luke

885
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,769
and disney michael and uh... username

886
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:01,839
disorder performers for public

887
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:04,058
and as i mentioned so it's a very

888
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:05,679
mister maynes user

889
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:12,679
so important to us from etc

890
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,729
let's talk on sister who's a realtor
kisses the baby was convince the oregon

891
00:42:16,729 --> 00:42:18,689
possibly precious

892
00:42:18,689 --> 00:42:22,779
then you'd see that is attacked his this
is actually uh... who once for a four

893
00:42:22,779 --> 00:42:23,839
bed but it's uh...

894
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,319
forwarded from sandra

895
00:42:25,319 --> 00:42:29,799
so setback estate because uh... my
current user but let's also understood

896
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:34,549
public could not have the privileges to
be this statement is talking about work

897
00:42:34,549 --> 00:42:41,549
so

898
00:42:57,099 --> 00:43:01,160
so uh... articles depart would it be
accurate and exploits as fearless

899
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,910
finishing remember these

900
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,330
uh... audit doesn't

901
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:05,490
is physically

902
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:09,408
it brought lots to do is it going to
tell you what it was just one moment

903
00:43:09,409 --> 00:43:11,690
and then u_s_ come on which you want to
run

904
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,240
so let's not just the one which is one
of them

905
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,209
and that's

906
00:43:17,209 --> 00:43:19,868
like the complete

907
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:23,689
because teknokrat reviews

908
00:43:23,689 --> 00:43:27,368
eight forty five sixty five and put back
into stings when the event

909
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:30,239
uh... if it's one of a political fuss
about the religious

910
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:31,779
uh... if you have

911
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:34,530
not only the vehicle on cities of
exploits

912
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:37,930
and make us deviate and then you can
read of the cell function for westward

913
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:42,129
execution and then you will be repeated
officially give you what you wanted by

914
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:45,259
that you can't just dedicated to a sport

915
00:43:45,259 --> 00:43:46,989
uh...

916
00:43:46,989 --> 00:43:49,119
okay road assist you know

917
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,829
so he says they are not bb overhead

918
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,319
it for six forty you are

919
00:43:53,319 --> 00:43:56,029
civilized moment so you can step two

920
00:43:56,029 --> 00:43:58,550
since you're not uh... b_b_a_ right now

921
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:02,969
saved a lot of sars cities of exploits
at the moment in his book six exploits

922
00:44:02,969 --> 00:44:07,129
uh... and depending on what portion you
are running between exploit backing

923
00:44:07,129 --> 00:44:10,618
so it had to guess in the first exploit

924
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:12,520
somebody i think that you problems

925
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:16,288
ten years exports succeeded hair

926
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:19,220
and then says for the i_d_ biennale
softer

927
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:23,799
it gets to be via privileges statements
of the quest for tuesday morning

928
00:44:23,799 --> 00:44:26,809
uh... so i've been principled
alendronate

929
00:44:26,809 --> 00:44:31,699
and then transportation two dollar and
then finally breach of adult function by

930
00:44:31,699 --> 00:44:34,249
the student mexican restaurant

931
00:44:34,249 --> 00:44:35,990
and then gives you a nice

932
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:38,618
true whatever but you can exit it was
the one

933
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:43,050
look at it before reading buddhist not
because he had immediately which is now

934
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:47,959
so dislike which failed only at when you
were trying to select the

935
00:44:47,959 --> 00:44:49,509
offered hatches from

936
00:44:49,509 --> 00:44:51,299
so start with a dollar

937
00:44:51,299 --> 00:44:54,159
we should look at all because we have to
be a few minutes

938
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:56,619
and a_b_c_ fish this tendency

939
00:44:56,619 --> 00:44:59,139
these are all the password hashes from
the

940
00:44:59,139 --> 00:45:03,420
promises to be the bull market

941
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,489
for example

942
00:45:06,489 --> 00:45:09,180
listing who heads the house

943
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,578
for the use of or congress or demo

944
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:14,809
and it's it's a fight this copy this

945
00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:21,809
you are a lot

946
00:45:40,689 --> 00:45:41,390
and europe

947
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:43,990
services the outlook for the common
people

948
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:47,390
and while you can't just boozing and you
have a sure no one has to be p

949
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:49,969
so unconvinced

950
00:45:49,969 --> 00:45:53,169
the spectacle on your notebook

951
00:45:53,169 --> 00:45:54,808
just like you were using

952
00:45:54,809 --> 00:45:56,640
on woman data so that's an

953
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,560
by your own borders reading those of
green

954
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,209
in windows by garmon says system

955
00:46:02,209 --> 00:46:04,399
securing whispered assistant

956
00:46:04,399 --> 00:46:08,319
this is very gently so if you find any
elected to start on one minute or so

957
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:09,139
that is

958
00:46:09,139 --> 00:46:11,040
uh... you can still existed was quote

959
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,880
uh... but did you leave it in english
for me to be solved

960
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,260
processor in oregon

961
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:19,289
if we could begin tv and all of these
are

962
00:46:19,289 --> 00:46:22,159
okay

963
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:29,159
you any questions of the state or
federal seat

964
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,209
yes oak

965
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:38,729
uh... or handing in my place they've
outgrown

966
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,339
used to stay that way

967
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,599
cursor cop cars an injection

968
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:44,780
so even though argues that it was not

969
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:48,269
foolish enough to create anyone function
and u_n_ body functions

970
00:46:48,269 --> 00:46:51,129
it does not need and those functions
because uh...

971
00:46:51,129 --> 00:46:54,390
there's something for discussing the
issue really combined equating

972
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:56,470
and precursor and uh...

973
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:59,129
babysitting they discuss it and that
will enable

974
00:46:59,129 --> 00:47:02,069
procedure

975
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,519
so using visit you can still

976
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:06,288
uh... work around that

977
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:12,139
priya function privileges

978
00:47:12,139 --> 00:47:14,599
lots of on something which

979
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:16,370
this huge irreparably find

980
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:17,700
i'll get in the white

981
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:22,279
and just from the uh... more poland and
didn't do this condition

982
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,779
it's equal injections in of bought the
backend database

983
00:47:26,779 --> 00:47:27,760
now on

984
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,039
a common uh...

985
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:31,049
conception off

986
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:34,719
exploiting secret invasion inordinate
backend databases that

987
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:39,179
uh... it does not have excuse your
mission so haha glad to go to school or

988
00:47:39,179 --> 00:47:43,209
it does not given support the execution
of went to the twenties

989
00:47:43,209 --> 00:47:45,319
so-and-so public mobile pda

990
00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:48,599
mean things like continued in westwood

991
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,149
that's what we were talking about here

992
00:47:51,149 --> 00:47:54,098
so so false assumption that it does not
support

993
00:47:54,099 --> 00:47:55,290
dynastic ladies

994
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:56,269
is right

995
00:47:56,269 --> 00:47:59,038
this is uh... a design

996
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:00,719
so diffuse

997
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:03,020
you have an indication of what here in
italy

998
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:07,770
selected from the sees it with your
input nine despues you wanted to do the

999
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:09,119
excellent quality

1000
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,579
yukon just for helps unequal inherit

1001
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:15,429
and start a new body inside horribly
isn't working

1002
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:18,009
this is not supported

1003
00:48:18,009 --> 00:48:22,039
so automatically going to be quite he's
they really need to find

1004
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:25,889
but the fact that their but you can
execute the investment

1005
00:48:25,889 --> 00:48:30,559
it was uh... if you have to take it was
called uh... or something nasty and we

1006
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:36,069
need to the mind of the clintons just
unbelievable so it would be

1007
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:38,619
so of

1008
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:40,899
an easy way to do it is

1009
00:48:40,899 --> 00:48:42,419
if there is a function

1010
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,249
look it up

1011
00:48:44,249 --> 00:48:49,238
impressed with what it looks like what
he's going sideways

1012
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:51,479
georgia can do is you can put conscience

1013
00:48:51,479 --> 00:48:55,598
in our court procedures because for
putting procedures need to stop paying

1014
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,029
the twenty and then start a new
statement foreign weeks beginning with

1015
00:48:59,029 --> 00:49:00,739
exhibit eager to mediate

1016
00:49:00,739 --> 00:49:04,169
but uh... we're going to raise a couple
of functions

1017
00:49:04,169 --> 00:49:05,390
so innocently

1018
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:07,699
uh... despite again for the function

1019
00:49:07,699 --> 00:49:09,599
and in fact function is reliable

1020
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,619
that and i can use that without a big
hit with a bit function

1021
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:14,389
and gustav

1022
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:15,900
so i could be an example is

1023
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:20,389
if there is a function which is a little
bit of pianist fuel injection

1024
00:49:20,389 --> 00:49:23,039
i think all of that function in mysql

1025
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:24,679
specifically

1026
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:25,580
austenite

1027
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,669
the enniskillen

1028
00:49:26,669 --> 00:49:28,479
as an argument that function

1029
00:49:28,479 --> 00:49:32,000
and detective lange indirectly exit
might be a rescue at

1030
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,749
the dysfunction

1031
00:49:33,749 --> 00:49:35,328
that make sense

1032
00:49:35,329 --> 00:49:39,209
to permit don't give a national units
ample

1033
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:42,538
yet this is not the only case uh... this
was going to be back in two thousand

1034
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:44,999
five at black act

1035
00:49:44,999 --> 00:49:46,499
so

1036
00:49:46,499 --> 00:49:49,538
if you find a function which is a little
bit of a point to look real

1037
00:49:49,539 --> 00:49:53,540
antennas and a story i mean what really
is what's called what i did exist

1038
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:57,689
overlook elitist record with the
privileges of of the process

1039
00:49:57,689 --> 00:49:59,690
so it's end up going

1040
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:02,789
so this dysfunction was loaded with
before a little

1041
00:50:02,789 --> 00:50:07,899
and with just a in court but that
without the close to

1042
00:50:07,899 --> 00:50:10,799
that that's what

1043
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:14,529
acadia here about regional cup

1044
00:50:14,529 --> 00:50:18,479
the pivot this village to function
executed

1045
00:50:18,479 --> 00:50:21,859
maybe qantas function and i ask you at
they're going to go cases

1046
00:50:21,859 --> 00:50:25,139
dysfunction might have the authority of
current do that

1047
00:50:25,139 --> 00:50:29,209
or dysfunction might have got a deal to
find that

1048
00:50:29,209 --> 00:50:32,928
plus based its function of the authority
of the fighter

1049
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:36,039
and it's defined by our team is usimanx
says

1050
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:39,810
that they don't have to worry about it
really is because whatever you injecting

1051
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:43,629
it's it's said the its people and by a
function

1052
00:50:43,629 --> 00:50:45,310
is running at the height of next user

1053
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:47,660
fidelity executing european executed

1054
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,638
with the privileges of sis using

1055
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:51,859
divorce case

1056
00:50:51,859 --> 00:50:52,909
second gays

1057
00:50:52,909 --> 00:50:54,769
if uh... peck function

1058
00:50:54,769 --> 00:50:58,968
is not defined by a privileged user
always always defined

1059
00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:00,690
biochemist herbert has

1060
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:04,199
or tidy admissible user

1061
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:06,819
genetic secret yesterday

1062
00:51:06,819 --> 00:51:10,080
european escalated the executed with
darkening privileges

1063
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,169
so it's not directly related to the
nation

1064
00:51:13,169 --> 00:51:17,179
but what you do then is because penalty
to its ups ql

1065
00:51:17,179 --> 00:51:19,869
tracking bought at every level packages

1066
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:21,470
packaging the backend database

1067
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:24,259
and exploit that

1068
00:51:24,259 --> 00:51:26,000
like discontented with

1069
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,169
that confusing i think that now

1070
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:31,929
so and here is that i give you a demo
that this was headed by a little bit

1071
00:51:31,929 --> 00:51:33,489
more

1072
00:51:33,489 --> 00:51:35,619
that they got it from there is that

1073
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:37,189
if a function

1074
00:51:37,189 --> 00:51:41,348
is one of the pianist injection it's
symbian work

1075
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:44,190
right even easier to escort irrespective
wall

1076
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:47,669
what definetly be defeated

1077
00:51:47,669 --> 00:51:51,069
irrespective off but that's what i need
to find that what would expose the

1078
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:52,899
prints will use it

1079
00:51:52,899 --> 00:51:55,529
if it's defense department is definitely
a ruler

1080
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,149
if it's going to school user

1081
00:51:57,149 --> 00:51:59,960
the created at the time depends on what
sort of

1082
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,539
access have been stolen the back-end
databases

1083
00:52:02,539 --> 00:52:07,890
and stuff like that

1084
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:11,029
there is a printout very popular package

1085
00:52:11,029 --> 00:52:12,540
uh... mark important

1086
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,300
d_b_s_ exports and jim

1087
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:17,039
between the problem and among security
such as

1088
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:20,519
because we have had a series of
liberties in the past

1089
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:21,508
in particular

1090
00:52:21,509 --> 00:52:22,740
i've gotten about

1091
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,819
dysfunction

1092
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:26,829
point get the main index traders

1093
00:52:26,829 --> 00:52:27,979
so this function

1094
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:30,979
uh... was delivered to be a
discrimination

1095
00:52:30,979 --> 00:52:32,959
this was won by sis

1096
00:52:32,959 --> 00:52:34,499
and state

1097
00:52:34,499 --> 00:52:37,428
be limited to just call the spontaneous
liquidity

1098
00:52:37,429 --> 00:52:38,829
injector pianist do it

1099
00:52:38,829 --> 00:52:42,319
added that bill is going to be clear is
that the u_s_ is

1100
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,209
uh...

1101
00:52:43,209 --> 00:52:44,240
so you can

1102
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,169
university person equities if you find
icy conditions like

1103
00:52:48,169 --> 00:52:51,169
as you can you going to insert and
update statements

1104
00:52:51,169 --> 00:52:55,459
and as you say you can exhibit was
scored as a

1105
00:52:55,459 --> 00:52:57,959
so discusses what the function was doing

1106
00:52:57,959 --> 00:52:59,328
uh... it was ticking

1107
00:52:59,329 --> 00:53:03,539
despite underscore scheme i'm typing
this morning consistently opposed

1108
00:53:03,539 --> 00:53:04,579
and that

1109
00:53:04,579 --> 00:53:05,859
tools to bet on it goes

1110
00:53:05,859 --> 00:53:08,170
word and used in the creation of

1111
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:09,889
beyond its current

1112
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:11,669
anonymous pianist who brought

1113
00:53:11,669 --> 00:53:13,999
which word that this wasn't getting
executed

1114
00:53:13,999 --> 00:53:17,118
so i can't think of it like

1115
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:18,789
exuding a prepared statement

1116
00:53:18,789 --> 00:53:25,789
but what the statement is is basically
controlled by u

1117
00:53:26,429 --> 00:53:29,769
this was the exploit this was again he's
by their industry this is actually

1118
00:53:29,769 --> 00:53:31,680
inordinately davis is a

1119
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,219
so stick starting two thousand six

1120
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:36,359
but uh...

1121
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:38,328
the help of a large impact on what's

1122
00:53:38,329 --> 00:53:39,049
julie

1123
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:42,729
i can you find this white board in the
white opportunity

1124
00:53:42,729 --> 00:53:43,730
widening

1125
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:47,159
rapport pincus for clients have called
is going to be

1126
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:50,029
present in the atlantic ave ste

1127
00:53:50,029 --> 00:53:51,150
for like

1128
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:52,349
uh...

1129
00:53:52,349 --> 00:53:53,939
like that that is to present

1130
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,138
is because the way or the back to what

1131
00:53:56,139 --> 00:53:58,979
first of all you pay for itself they
accept from

1132
00:53:58,979 --> 00:53:59,899
to the oracle

1133
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,869
and then if the security would be

1134
00:54:01,869 --> 00:54:03,859
and you have to pay for the facts as
well

1135
00:54:03,859 --> 00:54:07,139
so it's not like you bought a product
and you get back to school three like

1136
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:09,709
microsoft onto doesn't look like this

1137
00:54:09,709 --> 00:54:11,658
so usually to pay for the fact is

1138
00:54:11,659 --> 00:54:13,470
and secondly uh...

1139
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:15,000
if you pay for the practice

1140
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,379
uh... orchid pods deployment it was a
down payment

1141
00:54:18,379 --> 00:54:23,299
so activity like a customer who have
confidence and support that

1142
00:54:23,299 --> 00:54:26,479
imagine that people who are still
available for than instances

1143
00:54:26,479 --> 00:54:30,868
it's a little bit and customers sunbathe
before graphs of such a long but don't

1144
00:54:30,869 --> 00:54:32,669
bet just print

1145
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:34,638
ignored badges

1146
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:35,469
and uh...

1147
00:54:35,469 --> 00:54:37,509
it is actually by going to find

1148
00:54:37,509 --> 00:54:42,039
oracle database which had never happened
to the plate

1149
00:54:42,039 --> 00:54:44,189
so

1150
00:54:44,189 --> 00:54:46,888
understood we're going to be a studio

1151
00:54:46,889 --> 00:54:50,499
exercise a framework for color blindness
condition

1152
00:54:50,499 --> 00:54:52,249
uh... i've paid

1153
00:54:52,249 --> 00:54:54,069
discussing aboard this too because

1154
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:56,789
there are a number of consulted they are
so many good ones

1155
00:54:56,789 --> 00:54:57,799
but still not

1156
00:54:57,799 --> 00:55:00,460
and restored as arsenic john's in front
of those two words

1157
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:04,059
and i had the ligament running the but
it was then this one

1158
00:55:04,059 --> 00:55:08,170
budget cut or some features which
students do not have independent state

1159
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:12,529
and maybe you want to bring this to
inform for these features

1160
00:55:12,529 --> 00:55:13,889
so i'll explain

1161
00:55:13,889 --> 00:55:20,889
these features

1162
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:49,609
so this is how precludes no looks like

1163
00:55:49,609 --> 00:55:54,239
because he is a frame-up in effect for
exporting by masculine fiction and yeah

1164
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:55,559
right

1165
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:56,819
so if you get it

1166
00:55:56,819 --> 00:55:59,389
that this is the chorus point and uh...

1167
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:03,129
these american extract data from the
backend database

1168
00:56:03,129 --> 00:56:08,279
it supports an assessment

1169
00:56:08,279 --> 00:56:12,949
so it supports mssql and mysql was first
in oregon

1170
00:56:12,949 --> 00:56:16,479
it basically a onerous for for
extracting data from from back in

1171
00:56:16,479 --> 00:56:20,178
databases

1172
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:21,339
defeated beats

1173
00:56:21,339 --> 00:56:25,279
is quite who had is uh... despite the
exploitation

1174
00:56:25,279 --> 00:56:27,139
so you can use this to

1175
00:56:27,139 --> 00:56:30,879
to know what's going on between the two
more day books

1176
00:56:30,879 --> 00:56:31,839
uh...

1177
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:38,719
left the stock market

1178
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:43,999
so i have up orcas equalling ditional
here

1179
00:56:43,999 --> 00:56:46,509
level partners the that i'm a good
morning

1180
00:56:46,509 --> 00:56:49,549
so if i do room is equipped to

1181
00:56:49,549 --> 00:56:53,529
eleven unusable then they have done
something from the uh... i can make up

1182
00:56:53,529 --> 00:56:55,329
his court accounting

1183
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:57,209
so if i do

1184
00:56:57,209 --> 00:56:59,038
eleven minus one

1185
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:01,119
standard and the company

1186
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:02,919
if i do

1187
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:06,459
just eleven ever done anything

1188
00:57:06,459 --> 00:57:08,939
and for nuclear minus one

1189
00:57:08,939 --> 00:57:11,558
so prominence

1190
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:13,060
they still distant uh...

1191
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:13,979
returns accounting

1192
00:57:13,979 --> 00:57:18,428
so basically ah... whatever language is
it's giving uh... it's going to be

1193
00:57:18,429 --> 00:57:19,349
across

1194
00:57:19,349 --> 00:57:22,299
and these are the medical questions
aren't being performed in indian tv

1195
00:57:22,299 --> 00:57:23,979
across

1196
00:57:23,979 --> 00:57:26,319
texas intrinsically

1197
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:27,130
uh...

1198
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:29,419
some items from something

1199
00:57:29,419 --> 00:57:34,348
near despair amiga is equally do in this
case it stood minus two which is ten

1200
00:57:34,349 --> 00:57:37,489
uh... and once the desert

1201
00:57:37,489 --> 00:57:39,839
so

1202
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,459
so using the spiders collecting
difficult you know you can't you get

1203
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,569
exploited

1204
00:57:43,569 --> 00:57:50,569
so you can say

1205
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:58,559
its authority that you are ever

1206
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,909
then you're going to database

1207
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:02,249
in this case it so i can

1208
00:58:02,249 --> 00:58:05,999
not modern big ones lexical map he
actually fingerprint that it would be

1209
00:58:05,999 --> 00:58:06,899
that is for you

1210
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,280
mines and returned on scenic that they
did what you want to exploit

1211
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,380
in this case you exploiting uh...

1212
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:15,879
gordon database we just like to be in
this case

1213
00:58:15,879 --> 00:58:18,629
uh...

1214
00:58:18,629 --> 00:58:19,359
condemn

1215
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:22,769
he would be a screenplay vigilant
lipstick on the more books

1216
00:58:22,769 --> 00:58:26,879
in this case i want to so it is our from
glenn

1217
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:29,529
which we're going to go into his
username or what

1218
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:32,109
escalating tension

1219
00:58:32,109 --> 00:58:34,859
okay and then we're going to do is

1220
00:58:34,859 --> 00:58:36,729
provided a matching string

1221
00:58:36,729 --> 00:58:39,828
which issued identify and gets over to
win a pulitzer spawns

1222
00:58:39,829 --> 00:58:44,059
so every time i quaid e screw between a
darn this string accounting

1223
00:58:44,059 --> 00:58:46,270
and every time it's forty promoter don
there's

1224
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:52,329
so this is the deterministic factor

1225
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:55,709
part of this

1226
00:58:55,709 --> 00:59:02,049
then does fundamentals the of of mysql
query an admin isms minus the injection

1227
00:59:02,049 --> 00:59:07,599
because unix ivy dot based on the other
messages agreed any lead uh...

1228
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:09,339
disconnection is actually

1229
00:59:09,339 --> 00:59:11,399
amid the ruins of squat user

1230
00:59:11,399 --> 00:59:14,999
but you must be read just what is it is
one of the cooper recycling

1231
00:59:14,999 --> 00:59:16,859
before the council oracle

1232
00:59:16,859 --> 00:59:20,299
it does not agree to use that way before

1233
00:59:20,299 --> 00:59:22,749
okay uh... before we do this

1234
00:59:22,749 --> 00:59:26,049
all use it to you might be deviate
because we had uh...

1235
00:59:26,049 --> 00:59:28,020
and explain to me like an application
similar

1236
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:30,400
and he gave everybody bb it says that

1237
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,710
and i haven't been and you know will
give you a peek in at the

1238
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:36,220
that exploited said

1239
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:37,839
this is that we have the

1240
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:44,840
bb appearing to select first few
arguably was first

1241
00:59:50,749 --> 00:59:54,879
tremendous exploit so everybody was
deeply again and then happens he looks

1242
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:55,750
like the

1243
00:59:55,750 --> 01:00:01,739
the password hashes so we need to do you
want it

1244
01:00:01,739 --> 01:00:05,229
bernard engineer org tomorrow and have
privileges anymore

1245
01:00:05,229 --> 01:00:07,529
so object that's what i call exploit

1246
01:00:07,529 --> 01:00:08,339
so

1247
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:12,779
using the spine discrimination exploit

1248
01:00:12,779 --> 01:00:14,229
chocolate let's

1249
01:00:14,229 --> 01:00:21,229
select something

1250
01:00:27,009 --> 01:00:30,060
boardreader triplex acknowledge a
possible rashes

1251
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,920
promises don't look overkill

1252
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,800
and see if if it works

1253
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,089
now this is great because

1254
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,969
argues that does not have the privileges

1255
01:00:36,969 --> 01:00:40,099
let's see what happens

1256
01:00:40,099 --> 01:00:45,039
so it because both on the land and uses
added something i'm not quite right here

1257
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:48,229
so that's quite revisited

1258
01:00:48,229 --> 01:00:51,638
you know what you want to get rid of
normandy

1259
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:53,789
i can't just emblematic

1260
01:00:53,789 --> 01:00:55,159
uh...

1261
01:00:55,159 --> 01:00:58,849
said exploited because i was able to
look at the time it is

1262
01:00:58,849 --> 01:01:02,419
it did not of course is to be honest
exports extension exploit

1263
01:01:02,419 --> 01:01:04,479
which is uptight tree

1264
01:01:04,479 --> 01:01:08,759
to be on the second thoughts runs
exploit give us immediately this and

1265
01:01:08,759 --> 01:01:12,969
then then try to find the dig up

1266
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:17,089
two letters and alternative you know and
anything that most exploit incision and

1267
01:01:17,089 --> 01:01:18,160
and even bite

1268
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,529
margaret mead upbeat might want to be

1269
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:22,749
immediately but what happens

1270
01:01:22,749 --> 01:01:24,759
serves simple

1271
01:01:24,759 --> 01:01:27,169
similarly it supports to his critics
issue

1272
01:01:27,169 --> 01:01:28,808
so

1273
01:01:28,809 --> 01:01:31,569
for was courting solution to a meeting
of this

1274
01:01:31,569 --> 01:01:33,419
or you have to do is

1275
01:01:33,419 --> 01:01:35,009
prorated bite

1276
01:01:35,009 --> 01:01:37,129
forges whispered execution

1277
01:01:37,129 --> 01:01:40,589
and the frequency individual groups with
an animal bones

1278
01:01:40,589 --> 01:01:47,589
so sequins and the

1279
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,330
in the fire

1280
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:01,859
neck-and-neck occurs when the singer

1281
01:02:01,859 --> 01:02:06,409
than this

1282
01:02:06,409 --> 01:02:09,109
they go up to a sikorsky was quitting
solution as well

1283
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:10,650
uh... dissident

1284
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:13,859
oracle taken runners system it is

1285
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:16,619
and different system

1286
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:19,369
uh... and this actually turns itself
upside when you're done with it

1287
01:02:19,369 --> 01:02:23,929
it's a uh... proportion painted the same
for we'd be happy residents of that

1288
01:02:23,929 --> 01:02:26,060
nephew ophelia pen-based

1289
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:29,009
everybody on the cancelled has has
deviated

1290
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:31,339
at the reunion

1291
01:02:31,339 --> 01:02:34,589
they just quickly before i get thrown
out of the state

1292
01:02:34,589 --> 01:02:39,259
unsure works for demo of uh... of
something happened and that's what

1293
01:02:39,259 --> 01:02:40,619
curriculum but it was a

1294
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:41,980
sequin ditional

1295
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:43,619
uh... which came out

1296
01:02:43,619 --> 01:02:45,009
earlier this year

1297
01:02:45,009 --> 01:02:48,979
and this bad visited identity mssql
applications

1298
01:02:48,979 --> 01:02:52,770
so what that would do if you can get a
massive massive object waiting

1299
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:54,009
and change your

1300
01:02:54,009 --> 01:02:55,249
your friend and

1301
01:02:55,249 --> 01:02:58,769
so it the cricket cannot do anything
maliciously encyclical is quote a little

1302
01:02:58,769 --> 01:03:02,848
bit of news and then hike or d_m_z_ what
if we're going to look at this stage

1303
01:03:02,849 --> 01:03:05,079
independent of the verification

1304
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:07,839
salam now are some appeals and use it

1305
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:11,328
global connects to your litigation

1306
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:14,479
then he's was also uses malicious
website

1307
01:03:14,479 --> 01:03:17,410
and what's your read site because
everything is meeting in the back and

1308
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:19,960
interest and all these measures that
site

1309
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:24,089
the law in some browser-based exploits
into this uh... end users

1310
01:03:24,089 --> 01:03:27,578
so it's a lot to stop needing a devotee
productively and users contract in

1311
01:03:27,579 --> 01:03:28,360
decline

1312
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,059
not so much to say look

1313
01:03:31,059 --> 01:03:34,309
services are so i don't have to do
something similar for oracle

1314
01:03:34,309 --> 01:03:37,509
and spend uh... disorders rebecca is the
perfect

1315
01:03:37,509 --> 01:03:40,680
the same uh... discrimination since we
would relate to it

1316
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,229
subordinates conviction

1317
01:03:42,229 --> 01:03:43,720
not to be able to set up

1318
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:48,089
or anything like it is uh... hema
displays brother or problem

1319
01:03:48,089 --> 01:03:49,220
so i will

1320
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:51,468
a massive object waiting in the back of
database

1321
01:03:51,469 --> 01:03:53,369
to the president relaxing the

1322
01:03:53,369 --> 01:03:54,639
montebello skip

1323
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:58,809
and a telescope real then point to
development workable

1324
01:03:58,809 --> 01:04:02,279
sold at the brotherhood and ultimately
happy

1325
01:04:02,279 --> 01:04:05,409
unexplored transfer

1326
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:09,389
so i i liked about sort of one here

1327
01:04:09,389 --> 01:04:11,929
and then

1328
01:04:11,929 --> 01:04:15,489
denial on steamboat somewhere

1329
01:04:15,489 --> 01:04:17,759
cases ever started

1330
01:04:17,759 --> 01:04:20,699
now i go to the

1331
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:22,089
the world

1332
01:04:22,089 --> 01:04:24,589
we need to be able to go one label
normally

1333
01:04:24,589 --> 01:04:26,149

1334
01:04:26,149 --> 01:04:29,759
people would want to go on linux

1335
01:04:29,759 --> 01:04:36,759
and it's going to take the water

1336
01:04:41,319 --> 01:04:46,630
uh... dividend assist national bank
statement as to what do you want it

1337
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:49,940
denny by playing the first lady what
might be a site

1338
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:52,030
then you would see that description is
not changed

1339
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:54,710
and even the most launch a new high even
build

1340
01:04:54,710 --> 01:05:01,710
which we plan to uh... dispose of the
one more time

1341
01:05:03,659 --> 01:05:06,129

1345
01:05:15,849 --> 01:05:22,849
missile and the traditional

1346
01:05:27,489 --> 01:05:31,829
annual session opened so overwhelming to
production from a ninety address

1347
01:05:31,829 --> 01:05:34,509
uh... which is the same as the wondering
how you

1348
01:05:34,509 --> 01:05:38,139
so we have not had the sort of a v
impact the the end users now

1349
