1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,639
but should not be keeper at me our minds
john pierce i come from austin texas

2
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:12,859
serve my background i would frighten him
on the product line executive some

3
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:15,939
response of for all the security
products and not ideal internet security

4
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:17,199
systems

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,460
prior that i work for cisco under
security technology group

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,330
and then before that i work for the u_s_
intelligence community right now i A

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,570
um... for me i call it security someone
would like to be here wish i could be

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,549
shown how to happen amazon i_t_c_ cloud
that it wouldn't be doing that

9
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,589
will be going kind of over the risks

10
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,020
so what i'm talking about is how the
security equation why that's kind of

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,700
important kind of understand that before
we start biting into the clouds

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,510
what is it what are some of the various
cloud models that will be talking about

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,660
why the important why the out there

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,120
is any of this stuff really new

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,559
we'll talk about virtualization as
virtual vision is very much a key

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,770
component to cloud computing

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,380
um... there also is a lot of induces a
lot of different risks uh... with the

18
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,230
clout that will kinda go over and we'll
talk about

19
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,019
all things are to be mitigated

20
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:07,089
we'll talk about embedded virtual
security

21
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,600
and why that's important we start
looking at securing god virtual

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,479
frameworks that tomorrow

23
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,530
animals have a quick summary had not
been secured at

24
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,960
so we look at security today from all of
us in this room i mean equation has

25
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,279
completely changed

26
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,320
we look back in the early nineties late
nineties even early two thousand ceo

27
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,600
haven't security was a great day no
firewall access control on segmentation

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,458
all these things were best practices

29
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:35,270
and you see all these different types of
point solutions pop up here and there

30
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,990
but were clearly not more of a global
perspective now is a lot of the redwoods

31
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,190
working fine see that were seen

32
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,910
compliance e that's not a religious with
perspective pc ideas asking ross and

33
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,970
talking about legislative

34
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:52,980
country regulations excedrin work data
can even tried side seat country borders

35
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,560
so it's been very interesting of how
it's driving security and driving in the

36
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,430
infrastructure so a lot of us work in
today

37
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,850
from when we look at the economic crisis
that we see that story across the uh...

38
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,990
the globe

39
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,149
it has really driven into the primer for
virtualization cloud computing

40
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:11,809
in again which is a great thing 'cause
it's an emerging technology on back if

41
00:02:11,809 --> 00:02:13,669
we can all take advantage of it again

42
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:16,469
understating the risk of pretoria going
up in the clout i think is really

43
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,799
important

44
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:20,949
problem we start talking about the front
landscape the from landscape is

45
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:25,009
absolutely change when we start looking
at how the attack landscape was again of

46
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:26,458
the nineties

47
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:29,929
in a really to thousands it was pretty
much direct attacks them try to get

48
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:31,669
internet works at a ra

49
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:35,849
target bill s is applications were ones
that will really bob focused

50
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:39,759
foresee a lot today from a lot of our
research is a lot of that has changed

51
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,599
i mean now the client it's all about the
web browser it's all about sir regrets

52
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,108
in web applications

53
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:48,369
when you start looking at uh... up
liberation of the internet how it's

54
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:49,859
being used here

55
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:53,339
used to deal with very static
environments one way you do not work one

56
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,389
way out

57
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:56,989
nothing was really transforming today
were dealing with dynamic

58
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:58,549
infrastructures

59
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:02,459
newline you cody next cetera things that
have not been vacant for such a long

60
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:03,209
time

61
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:04,959
introduces a lot of race

62
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,139
so what we've done from our exports
research are indeed is we put out to

63
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:09,589
report every year

64
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:12,728
and what we did is we discount folks in
on a couple things here because i think

65
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:15,419
these are important when you start going
up in the clout

66
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:17,129
everything is what the five

67
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:20,629
but it's important to know when we start
looking at silver site transfer attacks

68
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:24,108
we've seen you know such a massive
uptake in two thousand five

69
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:26,779
any in the second half of two thousand
nine

70
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:29,959
uh... on the attack that there's some
other petitions has been extremely

71
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,319
norman's

72
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,009
but when you look at the different type
of server-side attacks cross expecting

73
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:39,129
us jones action that leads republican
optimist jones action after mine

74
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:40,879
but when you start looking at you know

75
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,478
these are average daily attacks by month

76
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:47,179
what we have the f_d_a_ different stocks
located worldwide to read a lot of this

77
00:03:47,179 --> 00:03:49,379
information surgically great soon

78
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:53,129
reduce information statistics and
friends out of the media out of a pack

79
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:56,978
of united states out of south america
australia satara

80
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:59,759
but again the reason why we see such a
platoon region that's going to actually

81
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,819
taxes it's looking for it

82
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:04,988
there's a lot of people that are putting
a lot of organizations that are online

83
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:06,919
you-know-what resources out there

84
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:10,899
in really not checking them for uh...
any type of security vulnerabilities

85
00:04:10,899 --> 00:04:14,319
but again these are important because as
we start reversing the clout

86
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,358
these type of trends in in statistics
actually quite alarming

87
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,560
but we flip over on the client side

88
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,900
you know we've seen a massive change as
well

89
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,409
so if you could see the target from the
west perspective those attacks of

90
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,160
concerted effort to be opponents are
defecate more more as we start going

91
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,469
through the year

92
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:34,520
but what's really on the rise as the
brother

93
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,889
web browser so live your publishing they
would die for an injection drive-by

94
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:39,550
malware cetera

95
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,270
policies are real and when we start
looking at

96
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,198
distance this is the director here we
sort of opec document format former

97
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,429
abilities

98
00:04:47,429 --> 00:04:51,090
and look at the office for that and cuts
in the background of that

99
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,969
what we've seen pretty much of but
that's the way salons disagree that

100
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,580
c_d_f_ affordability set rocket

101
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,900
so as long as all the world problems
that we have today safari internet

102
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,310
explorer exe ever public applicant's
browser-based plug-ins for kiya

103
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,490
uh... well researcher virus marked out
actually found an exploited that

104
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,030
there'll be a bit of a flash flooding
vulnerability

105
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,818
uh... ever since the release that paper
we've definitely seen a arrives on tues

106
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:17,389
those specific attacks but we've seen a
lot of different those attacks kind of

107
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:21,300
uh... go into different areas and and
with respect to you uh... project it's

108
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,729
exploitation

109
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:25,990
soviet partisans are important because
when you start looking at the clouds

110
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,380
will be talking about very same is
basically of is basically server-side

111
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,349
than accessing this is basically through
your web browser

112
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:37,909
so understanding where the attacks are
landscape excedrin how that's changing

113
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:41,289
really needs a change the way how all of
us think of how we do security going

114
00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:44,120
into the future

115
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,120
when we start looking at virtualization
boner abilities

116
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,719
so basically what we've done is they've
gone back to export studies research

117
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,998
uh... back almost ten years ago

118
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:56,449
if you start looking at you know early
nineteen ninety nine email

119
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:00,009
there was in a very little tax out there
but very things that were trivial buffer

120
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:01,879
overflows rebate back then

121
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:04,210
as they start going through the years
you know

122
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,419
missus dinner vendors is that a new
sweeney's high profile vote ability are

123
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:09,859
exploitation

124
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,249
basilica of vmware esx we start

125
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:16,689
coming through two thousand five two
thousand sixteen as you can see

126
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:20,959
at promises escalated in two thousand
seven will be having some further defect

127
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,850
come out in two thousand nine

128
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:27,059
but what's important to note is that you
were to take the stand pat this over

129
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:30,169
uh... what application form abilities
translate

130
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:33,709
you'll see that that basically almost
identical

131
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:37,210
you have to get through here again
microsoft virtual pc

132
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,948
so we can to cover all of them

133
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:41,309
but what's important to note is that

134
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:44,319
you know we talked about the web
application for a building supply side

135
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,439
server-side another virtualization floor
abilities

136
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,770
than the last one

137
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:54,000
so basically doing of basic dot dot you
trying to get dot trying to break out

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,490
trying out the same virtual machine
trying to gather data cetera

139
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,279
all these things are possible but

140
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,119
becomes more and more importantly
starting in the clout will be talking

141
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:04,960
about multi tenancy isolation cetera

142
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,198
what things like that she wanted to ask
for all those things are boredom will go

143
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,840
into details on that

144
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,448
but again allotments are are trivial but
these things can happen in these things

145
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:18,019
are important to you to keep our eyes on
as we started in the virtualization

146
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:21,669
in liquid trust issue of pants for
either of the structures that are doing

147
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:25,508
allotted server virtualization projects
right now

148
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:27,800
without virtual desktop infrastructures

149
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,710
role in those out of the eeoc

150
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,388
want okay

151
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:38,169
somebody to your compliance e but i
think this one's very important uh...

152
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:41,159
uh... actually talk to the truck right
here yesterday here in sweden visa

153
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:46,248
multinational company you have uh... and
parking lots of cousins united states

154
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:49,479
but obviously which is really cool part
and parcel from security perspective it

155
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:50,169
is

156
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,318
organizations hopper followed that have
to have certain type of security checks

157
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:54,319
in place

158
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,509
obviously need that your complaint does
that mean you absolutely secure right

159
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:59,860
it's a matter of how you deploy

160
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,530
but united states the f_t_c_ idea sat
switches that came in hard data security

161
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,599
standard

162
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:07,959
injures basically told the requirements
that the fine

163
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:11,859
how you must be simply secure network to
help in the car do that

164
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:15,349
now this becomes even more important
because there's a big compliance to be

165
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:19,019
mcleod out of something familiar but
there was a applaud them to respond

166
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:21,800
amazon that talked about there were not
able to handle

167
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,970
pc ideas that's teacher one

168
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,509
uh... clients

169
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:27,999
uh... they were suspended updates and
that they do you have the capability

170
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:31,050
protected at penn did in the clouds

171
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,030
but think that simple and in

172
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:37,270
in understanding of cable if you look at
these different what requirements uh...

173
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,740
at wooden

174
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,770
you can take a look at a moment's very
boring to read all these that

175
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,329
we certainly do then they have

176
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,330
very specific requirements that you must
have right

177
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,840
that's important to know when we start
doing business in the cloud or

178
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,140
offloading certain

179
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,890
of aspects of our infrastructure in the
clouds

180
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,870
these are things become important

181
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,580
is compliance he really is something
that you have to here too

182
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:03,080
majesty pc i asking sample but different
countries have different dot compliance

183
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,520
leads to health care

184
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,100
uh... i was in luxembourg and what was
uh... talking to you a couple

185
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,380
corporations in the journalists there

186
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,210
and not to see their client detection
author financial data cannot go pass our

187
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,060
country borders right

188
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,800
so when you start talking about cloud
providers excedrin lobby things have to

189
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,130
be called located in the countries that
they are serving out that the different

190
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,610
cloud services

191
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,280
but what i want you to use this
basically cutting over what's the

192
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,910
problem skateboard we've seen and he's
absolutely changing

193
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,310
when we start looking at securities no
longer i just have a firewall places so

194
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,209
maybe

195
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,878
those things are good from access
control segmentation account keeping

196
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,110
that noise down

197
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,910
but will really start looking at
architecting and building up these

198
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,469
different solutions and or

199
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,930
you place your trust in a different
provider

200
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:52,300
these questions must be asked because
today your information is work more is

201
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,140
worth a lot more you know that destroyed
it

202
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,020
me ask you seem to different
presentations here's part b_ of a poll

203
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,000
data from the passports excedrin

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,100
all these things are important to drive
a lot of different things from the

205
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,720
underground perspective cybercrime sever
terrorism federer

206
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,880
but when we start coming up in the clout

207
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,410
all these things are really coming
together because what we're really

208
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,380
dealing with is everything that is
online on-time everyday

209
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,750
so we start looking at was the clout

210
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,890
he could probably at several different
vendors that how they were going here

211
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:24,010
might have a different version of you
know what it's about me

212
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,480
uh... clout should probably not be new
to any of us who have hotmail accounts

213
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,760
have used instant messenger our listings
reside in what would be the clout

214
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,230
but today there was a cloud being used
for so we're seeing a lot of different

215
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:39,020
corporations that are playing a lot of
their uh... meeting other corporate

216
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,470
confidential data but whatever they can
offload

217
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,720
right to the clout

218
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,670
um... the navy doing this side to expand
networks to expand availability

219
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,079
uh... to expand disaster recovery

220
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,700
uh... n_b_c_'s become important because
what the problem provides you from

221
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,910
the security perspective are just a
basic acts he is

222
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,130
a couple things here in rapid
provisioning

223
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,110
advanced virtualization

224
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,420
and kids new businesses away into
metered billy and based on usage

225
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,430
rights have been so that the amount of
bandwidth that you're using the amount

226
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,109
of stores that using

227
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,670
and again from our callbacks perspective
on what we're seeing from an economics

228
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,930
perspective

229
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,500
this is really starting to take off
uh... from the perspective of a lot of

230
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,760
different companies

231
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,180
further questions always being asked out
there what what what do i really want

232
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,640
store in there

233
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,689
and we start looking at the various
cloud models

234
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,940
yet interactive projects he enterprise
cloud and public clouds

235
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,210
and basically you can break it up it's a
private public clouds

236
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,230
uh... but when you start looking at well
what are some of the defense services

237
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,650
that are coming on the cloud an alarm
things are starting to take a lot of

238
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,430
uh...

239
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,620
uh... a lot more definition

240
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,710
that she uh... platform as a service you
have infrastructure as a service

241
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:56,140
supports appleton working very closely
with the company united states called

242
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,090
lock product a

243
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,620
uh... still a lot of speaking for vmware

244
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,590
obviously came up with infrastructure as
a service

245
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,080
but basically what they do is a offload
all i see infrastructure to a lot of

246
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,410
their clients

247
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,160
but what's really important working with
that company is really their focus on

248
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,810
security to focus and understanding

249
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:19,020
how they can keep the data separated how
they can keep it secure isolated

250
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,250
encryption that rustic cetera

251
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,570
and there's been quite a few challenges
for them running back in the states we

252
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:28,170
have what's called south seventy
compliant with incest seventy that

253
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:32,060
actually gives you a lot of different
ways to on my guest follow kind of a

254
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,770
checklist of the different type of
security that you must have on your

255
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,540
network in order to have some sort of
uh... service clout

256
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,550
and then work in essence
software-as-a-service

257
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,099
each of these almost are talking about
the motion to approve it

258
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,409
each of them have has her own different
type of security level

259
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:52,419
you know how much security would you be
expecting to be had at each atm at each

260
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:55,819
one of these to protect serbs provide
service levels

261
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,110
but when we start looking at public
clouds

262
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,340
uh... you know again as your critical
likey

263
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,880
putting your customer need a satara

264
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,870
uh...

265
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,640
you know it's it's how risky pursue our
in understanding of what security they

266
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,259
have

267
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:13,150
if i knew security was absolutely did
not understand everything that they had

268
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,610
uh... yeah i would probably feel safe
with it but it really depends on where

269
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,300
it's located who has a big several and
you're probably start seeing a rise of

270
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,550
different type of clout certifications
private i think that's probably gonna be

271
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,370
important as we go down

272
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,240
when we start looking at more than if we
don't want to be public but we won't

273
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,710
have a private cloud which is basically
in your infrastructure data centers that

274
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,880
you have today

275
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,880
is basically outsourcing that having
other people run that for you

276
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,500
but in that way you do you have some
control what they would call the clout

277
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,530
so why security important

278
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,689
so we live in a global economy logging
business all over the world so obviously

279
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:54,210
strategic outsourcing grid computing
wanted out of cooperation virtualization

280
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,990
you have all these different buckets
right all these different type of party

281
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,580
models that all of us have to look at

282
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,650
in from security perspective a lot of
politicians seem that sex write that

283
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:07,000
from all of us and will not have to be
security understanding the business of

284
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,420
why would you securities actually
important instances like how we have to

285
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,479
hack into someone's protect them

286
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,620
so we start looking at war with are some
of the rest that we have to deal with

287
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,480
when we start looking across the pacific
some of these different buckets

288
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,900
suddenly not strategic outsourcing so
it's vendor trusting up tonight and i

289
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,130
trust that banner for having my data

290
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,790
uh... outsourcing so there's a lot of
different that legislative bohol

291
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,099
boundaries

292
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:35,110
act ought to back up all those really
are resistant to collect luxembourg

293
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,900
for example and identity access
management really kinda come to mind on

294
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,709
that

295
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,069
is a question that that came out of
there was a result

296
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:43,949
talking to a bank there where

297
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,820
their email system went down and they
had to be paid out you know and that cal

298
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,260
question came up to me more terms they
pulled up a gmail account

299
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,750
sent that email that confidential data
on the court yet united it has been

300
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,850
reside mountain view california which
actually traverse the border exciter

301
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,260
begin policies are important to
understand

302
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,170
the web threats that talked about

303
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,979
the wet so they gave you the trends on
in the movie top gun estrella and ask

304
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,420
you all later after this talk

305
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:14,150
the real i mean the stuff is not here
radical uh... we see them on our socks

306
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,310
behind and i ve day by day basis

307
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,109
but it's important to understand insan
understand why you need to protect why

308
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,830
you need to have more than just a
firewall why you need to have to get

309
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,030
deep packet inspection settler

310
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,520
uh... data leakage i've deleted just
kind of like hell cloud is in two

311
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,680
thousand nine

312
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,929
last year it was all about the lp

313
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:34,639
uh... as we know that the first time
that we actually connected to the

314
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,290
internet uh... how did the lp problem

315
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,890
uh... except at this time i mean at the
force kind of breaking and hacking p

316
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,250
basement six address

317
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:47,810
uh... now want a break and apac myself
gallup polls much date as i can

318
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,479
injured it is very important

319
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,790
intimidated virtualization you know
shared infrastructure

320
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,010
so one word in virtualization the clout

321
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:01,220
you know is is my idea nordisk although
he did on one track revisor were i have

322
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,380
only my data yuan one system are one way

323
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,010
you know its market share in it that
shared that what's going on how it would

324
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,560
be protected houses being isolated

325
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,640
so we ought to start looking at the
different security concerns

326
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,030
you know how does not help the different
risks

327
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:22,089
summit in serbia that's always the issue
that we have much security uh... damage

328
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,300
prevention

329
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,270
and isolation technologies

330
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,860
i won't go into great detail on the
isolation technologies but when i think

331
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,380
is really important is understanding the
different types of providers that you

332
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,430
can use

333
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,689
uh... obviously vmware bob sanders mired
uh... technologies that you can't use

334
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:40,690
out there

335
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,540
but things like as seed money to be able
to you access controller said new labels

336
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,140
aren't that different virtual machines
from an isolation perspective

337
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,630
become extremely important in b w dot in
isolates up the data so there's no

338
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:58,180
cross-contamination

339
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,140
so there's a lot of risks uh... there's
a lot of a security that we could put in

340
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,519
their uh...

341
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,789
legally blind why this is important
there's no silver bullet as we all know

342
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:11,829
and here i think it's kinda funny about
this reminds me the story when the first

343
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:12,940
time way

344
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,140
really happens to be about twelve
thirteen years ago

345
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,830
and i've built a system security

346
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,369
with a brief too much of my senior
officials say yeah this is great i i

347
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:26,179
secure tickets unbreakable cetera side
talked for a while when i came back down

348
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,180
my mentor at the time setting down in
sight

349
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,280
he has many sugar so that i was a lack
of omaha wiser ninjas lawsuits guys

350
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,279
across the room guys wear that manila
gets pumped articles have been here

351
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,750
in your architecture wire after speaking

352
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,770
susan organisms no silver bullet that's
not gonna stop apple right just a matter

353
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,389
of

354
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,190
tiger deploying security common tourists
that you're willing to take

355
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,460
in understanding the technologies that
you have put in place

356
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,730
because as you see you haven't had a lot
of smart people appear who actually do

357
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,730
the embedded contracting inc cetera
there's a lot of things are possible

358
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,770
right a lot of things are are basically
really hard style right

359
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:06,480
but understanding what you're putting in
your structure what your securing in

360
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,220
what you're putting up in the play

361
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:15,220
all these things are important also
cares about will

362
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,029
sophal security one-on-one

363
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:23,220
so today we're not really dealing with
this obviously aren't the structures

364
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,130
that we have

365
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:27,950
there why uh... there we can see him to
get touching that you feel like setup

366
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,890
uh... gives a sense of you know of
ownership or sense of control right

367
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:36,659
boats are going in the clout paying a
lot about changes

368
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:39,390
net who has control or is it located

369
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:44,610
you talk about migration aunty motion
cetera at some of the stuff p inculcated

370
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,580
into another country

371
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,649
is it backed up with about the processes
in the in the twenty tickets

372
00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:53,100
disorder lost

373
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,469
excuse me how he's doing is at the end

374
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,080
does our security team gauge

375
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,270
all these again are extremely important
questions asked because

376
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,840
you know you don't have control you
don't know what's going on and uh... you

377
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,168
know you do you want to have a an idea
of what these are

378
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:11,040
now all of us in the room here in
security professionals immunity

379
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,120
initially for a long time processes

380
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,428
this is not rocket science pianist and
ask these questions right

381
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:19,390
but when we step back and look at you
know i would say when you look at the

382
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:23,210
security industry you have to go this
v_-twenty twenty percent that are highly

383
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:26,380
technical that really understand the
industry i think we have a lot of them

384
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,680
here in the room today

385
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,620
but should eighty percent better tell us
that don't understand bat woods

386
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,669
when they would ask his questions right

387
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:37,400
but the gets more from an educational
perspective to understand uh... you know

388
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,640
were out today we're going to have in
the right questions asked

389
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,530
and again i mean

390
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:46,110
utilises learning these are questions
that game we have not had a

391
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,199
got a response you before right

392
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,789
bus understand of how fast we correspond
to a more which are caught in the clout

393
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:56,100
lynn high-level i mean these are some of
the concerns in talking to a lot of the

394
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,928
for tobacco companies around the world

395
00:19:57,929 --> 00:20:01,450
uh... you know in talking about what he
wanted a cloud what are some major your

396
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,690
biggest concerns

397
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:07,279
uh... obscene usr compliances is really
huge how do you compliance with the

398
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,049
clout

399
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:12,139
except seminar turn you got free um...
do you trust that they have talked about

400
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,929
it

401
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:14,620
of the uh...

402
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,010
basic red which were checked someplace

403
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,530
because it becomes important because

404
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:22,100
in the united states if you're not
compliant

405
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,949
it cost you money

406
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:29,210
uh... before compliance i was really a
big issue united states um...

407
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,349
unified acted in costing money

408
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:35,320
but there is a ritual organization that
actually was p_c_r_ compliant that had a

409
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,220
breach

410
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,830
and that had to spend thirty two million
dollars u_s_ uh... in the last six

411
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,550
months to clean this up

412
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:46,590
seventy big problem uh... is heavy fines
there's even jail time with it

413
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,100
this security personal

414
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,590
a love compliance because that actually
forces people to really look at security

415
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,250
right

416
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,860
instead of saying hey we display that
one server out there

417
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,850
you know whitehead security look at it

418
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:02,570
now uh... i mean typically securities
always a lots one brought in this always

419
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,389
pretty much of a fire drill

420
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:08,250
but wasn't what about this is really
tight security eight oh out front

421
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,450
and then the whole notion of having less
control right etickets

422
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,830
it's putting this implicit ref into the
vendor that your you're putting your

423
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,689
selections up in the crowd and

424
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,910
so earlier we talked about the different
types of problems

425
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,700
so we have software-as-a-service
platform as a service infrastructure as

426
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,010
a service

427
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,919
and as you look at each of these i mean
there's

428
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,260
kind of a bit different security posture

429
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,559
um... but you kind of like these

430
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,740
uh... i mean

431
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,690
different people might have different
ideas of you know obviously we want to

432
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,909
put a percent full security on these

433
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:43,059
but when you look at the infrastructure
of the service providers in the their

434
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:46,170
disprove i mean you the basic
infrastructure

435
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:50,970
so using such as firewall so i can see
the essex separate uh...

436
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,890
this type of security technologies would
be product

437
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:58,160
foamy start coming up this platform as a
service not running plopped right

438
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,200
platforms that cleaning security

439
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,890
savannah securely becomes a lot more
elevated

440
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,429
when you get into software-as-a-service

441
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:08,190
you know you're dealing with the unions
kind of security building on one another

442
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,480
and once you get the
software-as-a-service

443
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,880
in all dealing with without applications
you know dealing with real data etcetera

444
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,610
uh... insure a lot of you so much of
what used to develop have seen him

445
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:21,199
google docs spreadsheets excedrin

446
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,290
uh... honestly people probably uses for
it can be very sensitive information

447
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,658
that they're not picking up of storing
up there

448
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:30,450
but it's important to understand that
when you're doing this this information

449
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,390
is being stored there so

450
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,580
is a channel that were doing this
through scripted

451
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,960
is my data that citizen is it

452
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,390
encrypt at rest

453
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,140
or it may even on the same server as
other clients are other users about

454
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,100
service

455
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,699
soon we start talking down all these
things start becoming important but

456
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,290
security can be large-scale down to
paying a part of what you're providing

457
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:55,190
but as we start talking up the top even
from the needs here

458
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:59,340
again one eight focused on how to how to
secure the equations changes focused on

459
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,649
you know the webpage that

460
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:04,469
uh... threats of trends that we see from
a server client side

461
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:08,430
those days are starting to become you
know ke focal points for a lot of these

462
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,990
providers that are providing both of
these different tiers

463
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,560
but it's important to note boorda
disruption of services again and working

464
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,260
with uh... there probably a block

465
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:21,680
is you know giving the clients a
capability to later in the security that

466
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,159
they want

467
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:24,900
insecurities not cheap

468
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,330
uh... but didn't have the options if
they don't have to ponzi uh... wrapped

469
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,199
around it

470
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:37,200
what do they want to but know what do
they want to protect etcetera

471
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:42,190
so this is quite a night start but we
look at managing the risks i think

472
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,570
that's the biggest thing out of walking
away here's this really understand multi

473
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:50,030
tenant security infrastructures
understanding da you know isolation and

474
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,520
why that is extremely important and
while trying to hammer that one time

475
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,870
is again understanding of how are they
having their data you know how they can

476
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,719
only be there infrastructures

477
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,730
these are questions that you need to ask
they're important gas they should have

478
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,220
an answer for you

479
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,890
uh... you talk to different uh...
vendors out there it's the end of amazon

480
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,470
get over it

481
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,620
you have lockers it's on a different
uh... vendors out there that they

482
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,678
provide a lot of services

483
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:17,050
but you know understanding union

484
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:20,389
the different types of security me
across to me

485
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,250
virtualization security

486
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,880
i mean it's a mystic unanimous these
environments that they are using

487
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,010
virtualization physicist a lot cheaper
um... baked salah cheaper it's more

488
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,890
efficient acts more green

489
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:35,880
i'm in charge a lot of what we're seeing
today na leans the traditional our

490
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,519
networks are traditionally instructions
that would see

491
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,010
when we started in the clouds

492
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:46,370
sky virtualization is is getting you jim
walker will go through that great detail

493
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,530
but human all these are just delivered
into the different platforms two

494
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,690
different services in a different
resources inc several

495
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:56,000
and then also going down to physical
security will not to talk about that but

496
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,960
obviously when you look at a lot of
these data centers uh... even somebody

497
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,970
to sense that you might have thought he
was armed guards trying to get through

498
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,240
it

499
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,250
betting arm guards and support their kid
could

500
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,660
when your front doors myweb my web
browser you know that catches the

501
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:15,500
security dynamic a lot

502
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,990
so still solidly quick seven

503
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:21,330
discuss summarize a little bit on cloud
and you kind of have to look at it meets

504
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:25,809
the fifa buckets a lot of us mike deland
very specific areas of security

505
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:29,050
uh... email people might kennedy access
uh... yeah

506
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,889
identity access management

507
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,730
blessings are really important and you
look at technology that we have to deal

508
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,190
with today people process technology

509
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,080
uh... people my kennedy i think that in
section the huge out of some remember

510
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,000
that the trigger attack that happened
uh... about uh... for weeks ago

511
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,340
basically ah... they were able to hack
into one of the executives from twitter

512
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,049
and grab his passport

513
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:55,720
which was a password that was used
crossed all accounts

514
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,800
email-id those things become important
understand that from a pool of people

515
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,440
process must update though mister darden
down information and data

516
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,110
so the fall creek shindig iraq's date in
motion

517
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,519
we talked about processing applications
so

518
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:12,659
s_l_ et cetera backed by villa building
confidence ality

519
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:15,700
the biggest thing from some parts of the
saturn security you know you know what

520
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,380
security hamper stuff so have a security
on the importance checking up resources

521
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,000
we don't want that to happen

522
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,330
we have not heard back yes for example
uh... lot of people don't want but that

523
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:27,710
it deserved for that it's going slow
down the availability of the network

524
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,760
seven another thing that's important to
note

525
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,010
uh... dynamic allocation of pool
resources and maturity resources

526
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:38,150
soon again give haven't updated ability
for automatic provisioning and and

527
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:41,610
remediation of anything that we have out
there that has been all hezbollah

528
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,889
abilities are has been exploited

529
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:47,820
and then physical infrastructures are
kind of talk about tax few moments ago

530
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,470
but again we're looking at data centers
that are extremely fortified about how

531
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:55,820
funds are sick cetera so when you look
at security admitted spans the whole

532
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,560
different

533
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,559
budget is different but that's over here

534
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,899
wasn't born in there that we have all
these different periods categories that

535
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,060
we can come to relate them to

536
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,839
but the biggest thing is this point out

537
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:11,310
we start in the cloudiness isolation
isolation isolation right

538
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:16,310
so were to stop on cloud computing
coming on the virtualization

539
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,220
noticed it was time on this one

540
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,049
just tell the benefits to virtualization
i think we all know these uh...

541
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:25,190
obviously the big thing is enabling
cloud computing uh...

542
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,700
you know this has helped a lot of
companies come up our mind very quickly

543
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,309
deliver applications deliver whatever
services they want to do

544
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:32,610
extremely fast

545
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:37,120
uh... it's green uh... it's helping a
lot of companies in this economy

546
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,209
sequel it's helping people who don't
have money to you

547
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:43,310
by data centers it saturday start
exciter itself

548
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,129
this kind of at a high level the
different

549
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,090
you know the benefits so i think a lot
of smoothens

550
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:52,418
problems start with the networksolutions
carry one on one

551
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:57,279
sobs the everything and we have wires
routers switches servers on rocks

552
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,090
everything was visible intouch anek
cetera

553
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,600
now all that's in the box

554
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,889
uh... everything

555
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:06,240
uh... the network virtual machines

556
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,700
if they're moving around two a_m_ you
know virtual machines brought several

557
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,820
so you know and then who is responsible
for the security of it right because

558
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,820
typically when we start looking at
different the structures that we know

559
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,120
when you let me give you dealing with
the networking team dealing with them

560
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:20,549
you know

561
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:22,510
to be some legal teams are doing well

562
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,520
your server team six federal right
securities

563
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,029
uh... we have different job

564
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:29,360
you know the difference is this an
infrastructure that you have to deal

565
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,110
with

566
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:34,679
not always comes down it into one device
rights and i got server admin he's doing

567
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,110
network administration setup

568
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,658
so it is getting more complex right

569
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:43,750
begin you can reduce costs by doing this
right absolutely ads in a lot more

570
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,080
complexity and will go through some of
those

571
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:54,080
because woodson coordinators understand
how do we manage reciprocal zation

572
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,419
so we look at this here there's actually
five different areas rolling up in a

573
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,930
touch too much on the hardware yet

574
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:04,100
but when we start breaking the sobbing
others different areas that we need to

575
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,449
focus on account understanding that you
know

576
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,840
there are some traditional rats don't go
away

577
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,790
uh... inwards

578
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,180
snot funny but i knew there was a survey
that was done on virtualization that one

579
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,070
out of the people and that's a lot of
people that work this generals and

580
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,139
security but

581
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,990
asking them if they thought will see
some some personalize it must be a lot

582
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:25,240
more secure than i am team you notice in
a regular in infrastructure

583
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,140
here is uh... mc america probably about
sixty percent of the certificate and i

584
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,490
thought that

585
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,409
discuss their virtualized there are a
lot safer

586
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:36,980
well your applications and operating
systems have no idea that to be in

587
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,260
virtualized

588
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:42,170
some exploit code does have that
capability

589
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:45,860
noble talk about virtual machines will
talk about the and stealing dynamically

590
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,699
location

591
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,110
why dot that's considered part of the
rest

592
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:53,169
will talk about the high provider and
then we'll talk about the management my

593
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,070
beloved sultana bust in each one of its
ok

594
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:59,760
police are looking at operating systems
and applications

595
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,010
you know all these threats remain the
same

596
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:06,450
buffer overflows esculent action cross
expert dean data leakage uh...

597
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:10,480
all these are still fair game in are
still out there here regardless if your

598
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,000
your virtualized or not

599
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,320
we start looking at some of these other
things um... mister coming down as you

600
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,090
know

601
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,760
it does and uh...

602
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,549
we certainly can't buy western
application for us

603
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:22,889
begin we've seen

604
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:27,530
premature the downturn onto stu wrapped
heart attacks against the laughs uh...

605
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:31,220
because it's so much easier to keep the
the um... stick to the web applications

606
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,170
are up to the web browser cetera

607
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:36,860
but again we start looking at uh... what
are some of the rest moved this one

608
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,770
absolute still remains the same

609
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:43,150
when we start looking at virtual
machines you know we start he needs to

610
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,150
your compliance e dot g

611
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:49,250
uh... you know the villages spent our
activate the ants you know this is great

612
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:52,720
you can shut them down but if you have a
bunch of teams are shut down

613
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,120
exit altered they could offer the update
streams in the event or something that's

614
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,449
out there that's pretty catastrophic
conficker excedrin unions that

615
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,019
the exploited a day

616
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:06,210
fish are talking about virtual sprawl
magnification

617
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:10,280
so email keeping track of the teamster
came how large organizational

618
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,289
infrastructures

619
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:16,559
these become important but again when
these are in the clouds things that you

620
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,149
know

621
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:20,330
we're really not things that were really
worried about um... as a user of the

622
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,720
farm

623
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,680
but has passed a provider desires these
are things that are really important

624
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,400
uh... live migration

625
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,640
so are some of these moving to a secure
pm's as are less inova security

626
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,360
footprints uh... that's on some of these
systems

627
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,600
are they placed at risk com

628
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,250
you know some of this kind of security
policies no longer applied

629
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:43,340
so in these are some things to keep in
consideration we start working around

630
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,679
the little risk metrics of of
virtualization

631
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,720
in what's also important to note is

632
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,490
you know we're talking about server
virtualization i did talk uh...

633
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,420
actually last week in friday at the red
hat summits on securing virtual desktop

634
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,730
infrastructures

635
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:01,179
and uh... some of the same stuff
absolutely appliance right

636
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:05,809
uh... the good thing about the e_i_t_c_
have that data is not on for examples on

637
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:08,950
your laptop rights being stored up in
the class of some of the compliance and

638
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,830
some of it

639
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,990
but the leakage concerns that are
applicable

640
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,870
uh... nor will it play out on that so
when you start looking at your walls is

641
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:21,489
the same for p_p_i_ it's it's almost
identical

642
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,900
on replacing stunned

643
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:28,980
so either cava demonstrations on on the
next slide that kind of talks about that

644
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:33,590
you know other capabilities of of replay
talks or actually stealing nothing in

645
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,550
the motion

646
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,610
which u_s_ cut reveal

647
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:41,019
uh... someone stealing europeans in
motion like this one out of some

648
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:44,480
familiar with the sun exploits uh...
that was done

649
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,080
but basically what this doesn't see it

650
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,139
either of the mission or doing this via
my ipod

651
00:32:50,139 --> 00:32:52,770
traffic migration

652
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,810
the big deal

653
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,100
but a university was able to

654
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,439
can do a man in the middle

655
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,940
you know reset back up a lot

656
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,179
couple commence

657
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:08,300
and then they had access

658
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,210
so it's important to note any

659
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:14,390
when you have been oceana happy sayings
obviously of the vendors recommended do

660
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:18,570
this and i thought of that network uh...
this can be included as well

661
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:20,550
so it was important notice

662
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:23,809
emails just revealed this is done at a
university it can be done

663
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:28,139
uh... the likelihood of this happening
it's problem very very slim

664
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,279
um... in the event that it did and i
think you could have a much bigger

665
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,520
problem uh...

666
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:35,720
that's one thing you'll see i mean from
a security you will see a lot of proof

667
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,460
of concepts which are excellent in
fantastic

668
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,549
uh... you're one of the likelihood of
some of those actually really happening

669
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:46,809
this is a possibility but again if you
take the precautions as far as did other

670
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:47,620
band

671
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,570
in doing that uh... in krypton

672
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,840
that text of this happening are fairly
mail

673
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,649
it's reasonably security it that way

674
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,210
so we started in the high provider

675
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,350
in single point of failure for attack

676
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:05,459
uh... network are going back again when
you start remembering when we first came

677
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,730
out with the data centers here we have
multiple applications on one server so

678
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,819
if one application went down

679
00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:13,929
to bring down the whole parents that

680
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:16,839
so started coming out with one you
appliances we could have her application

681
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:21,168
server mailserver two separate
everything separated segregated

682
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:24,408
about today we're going to miss coming
back to that model right

683
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:27,799
where we have a high provider that's
basically hosting out

684
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,359
a lot of different uh... applications

685
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:34,149
the noisy doing just from an application
perspective it's also doing traffic

686
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:37,089
rights also doing a you know basically
years years

687
00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:40,268
very minimal you know appeal to all
three

688
00:34:40,268 --> 00:34:43,069
routing and switching

689
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:46,268
in europe into his is guaranteed
isolation

690
00:34:46,268 --> 00:34:49,839
so this kind of company back testing
clinics and icebergs you know why

691
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,339
isolation is really important is

692
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:54,768
you know basically you can

693
00:34:54,768 --> 00:34:56,688
simple isolation

694
00:34:56,688 --> 00:34:57,618
between

695
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:00,259
book virtual machines right

696
00:35:00,259 --> 00:35:07,259
he wants an expert

697
00:35:10,529 --> 00:35:14,639
does the really important surfactant
stress a lot when you start looking at

698
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:17,059
uh... isolation technologies

699
00:35:17,059 --> 00:35:20,769
uh... a c_-one excess for as a
incredible way of doing this kind of

700
00:35:20,769 --> 00:35:23,098
vmware and others as few as well

701
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:26,829
but others are things that kind of look
at christmas and download allowances for

702
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:29,210
free you can play with them understand
them

703
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,790
uh... obviously with the issue an
excessively familiar with secure

704
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,230
somewheres um...

705
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,579
specialist ten

706
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:37,559
uh... ex-con if i would say kind of the
same thing soon

707
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:40,459
fairy it's not that complicated to
configure

708
00:35:40,459 --> 00:35:44,428
uh... but again when you watch our
separation isolation he sings are

709
00:35:44,429 --> 00:35:48,209
important to understand uh... and
understand the risks of not having that

710
00:35:48,209 --> 00:35:52,198
in a multi-channel environment

711
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:55,549
so we start looking at the high
providers while he will get the word yes

712
00:35:55,549 --> 00:36:00,019
x three uh... ineptitude have to dig
servicers millions of million lines

713
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:01,689
occurred

714
00:36:01,689 --> 00:36:05,359
densmore research looking at yes
actually i dont

715
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,069
uh... you know they would use a surface
reduce the amount of lines of care

716
00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:12,459
uh... you know this is good and bad
let's get to the fact that you probably

717
00:36:12,459 --> 00:36:15,828
less there too probably exploit

718
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:19,409
but when we start looking at the
different services dot would you provide

719
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:19,839
mean

720
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,788
that provides for that working people
bilities communications

721
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:27,589
we look at other services that we got
the n_c_a_a_ signals a piaget taking

722
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:29,709
security into the high provider

723
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:31,828
disaster recovery devotion

724
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:35,059
so there's a whole lot going on here

725
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,849
he came on the search for me now that
this is our basically after

726
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:41,469
infrastructure in the box because we're
able to do everything for one

727
00:36:41,469 --> 00:36:43,139
centralized location

728
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:46,139
but again in doing that there's a lot of
risk there's a lot of blind spots that

729
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:50,849
you're not able to see from security
perspective

730
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:54,170
in the woods are going into the
management of the structure

731
00:36:54,170 --> 00:37:00,739
scene at the very beginning talked about

732
00:37:00,739 --> 00:37:04,910
let's talk about the web press uh... why
those are important to to understand

733
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:08,450
so everything that we can figure today
uh... obviously a lot of central to

734
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:12,689
commemorate ideas well vic a lot of it
systems are working today have web

735
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,879
interfaces

736
00:37:13,879 --> 00:37:17,749
so a lot of those attacked doctors and
uh... tracked threats and friends about

737
00:37:17,749 --> 00:37:18,808
talked about

738
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:22,529
uh... are still applicable onto the
management of this

739
00:37:22,529 --> 00:37:25,899
uh... you know obscene management and
having access to it

740
00:37:25,899 --> 00:37:30,138
can give you access to the virtual
machines the management data excedrin

741
00:37:30,139 --> 00:37:33,139
but what's even more important is the
software press is not ignoring the

742
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:37,369
operational threats his again in the
virtualization is not new i've used in

743
00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:39,569
virtualization since the sixties

744
00:37:39,569 --> 00:37:44,639
uh... fertile fishing cuttack came back
in uh... ninety-nine uh... vmware a lot

745
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:49,769
being used islands extensively for you
know research and and and and and and

746
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:50,598
uh...

747
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:51,929
aren t

748
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:55,919
but now people are actually using it
uh... unit for even typing at type one

749
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:57,828
type two

750
00:37:57,829 --> 00:37:59,259
virtual machines

751
00:37:59,259 --> 00:38:01,229
but the operational risks are

752
00:38:01,229 --> 00:38:05,319
you know you have allot of these new
technologies are coming to bear

753
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:09,439
is understanding of with the skills and
expertise are needed to configure right

754
00:38:09,439 --> 00:38:12,928
analogy to configure but understanding
of what are some of the operational

755
00:38:12,929 --> 00:38:18,879
threats of security threats are wrap
around that

756
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,959
so some takeaways assam virtualization
uh...

757
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:25,290
you know obviously it is a significant
uh... uh... email

758
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,779
operational risks uh... you know we talk
about the difference from a security

759
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:32,519
perspective i kind of two different five
areas of

760
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:35,419
virtualization with the exception of
hardware

761
00:38:35,419 --> 00:38:39,299
uh... but there's different risk that
introduce introduces the network our

762
00:38:39,299 --> 00:38:43,469
nurses to the com insect on into the
clouds and into the infrastructure

763
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:46,719
all these can be mitigated to some
degree

764
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:50,819
from our perspective from our r_d_
obviously we've seen a massive riots and

765
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:55,139
bomb abilities um... due the fact of xy
six virtualization

766
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:56,479
if someone new

767
00:38:56,479 --> 00:39:00,390
uh... i see a lot of people here use an
apple laptops um... you know this is an

768
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:03,469
art reports while but when you start
looking at technologies that starr

769
00:39:03,469 --> 00:39:04,619
continues

770
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:08,469
obviously from the community from uh...
that cyber actors are out there that are

771
00:39:08,469 --> 00:39:13,009
from black grey white hat six cetera
uh... those things become targets um...

772
00:39:13,009 --> 00:39:16,259
because their targets of opportunity
targets of

773
00:39:16,259 --> 00:39:17,099
you know of

774
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,339
afloat guess i'd say looking for

775
00:39:19,339 --> 00:39:22,808
but these are just some key takeaways
article from virtualization because

776
00:39:22,809 --> 00:39:24,049
again virtualization is

777
00:39:24,049 --> 00:39:27,529
happily they can have a cloud of dust
moving forward

778
00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:31,269
when we start talking about indebted
virtual security

779
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:34,319
you know how can you look at it and how
can we actually start putting in some

780
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:36,119
more security

781
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:40,229
obviously again isolation is going to be
huge uh...

782
00:39:40,229 --> 00:39:43,319
but havent skill building you'll be able
to grow a trip to different security

783
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:45,329
footprints that we have here

784
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:48,219
and understand no words security fit in

785
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:52,499
security can fit into the same layer as
as a guest right and we've seen a lot of

786
00:39:52,499 --> 00:39:56,799
donors after that happened act it out a
lot of the security should be

787
00:39:56,799 --> 00:39:59,379
intrusion prevention firewall to set up

788
00:39:59,379 --> 00:40:02,959
that's actually been hanging up out at
at the gas level

789
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:05,138
that's one way of doing it right

790
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:08,749
so have the capability of deep packet
inspection said being able to be on the

791
00:40:08,749 --> 00:40:12,200
piece which and understated being in the
movie switch

792
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,129
in kind of looking at the traffic it's
going back and forth right so you can

793
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,289
have

794
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:20,130
you know one of the web server one of
the database back into you fuckin

795
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,259
websphere

796
00:40:21,259 --> 00:40:24,459
that actually happened since separation
there you-know-what for any type of our

797
00:40:24,459 --> 00:40:31,459
buildings are explicit approxi into an
area that you have no visibility scene

798
00:40:33,579 --> 00:40:36,460
an opportunity to spend another
perspective but actually moving up in

799
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:40,149
the hosts on the campaign to replace on

800
00:40:40,149 --> 00:40:44,429
so there is a lot happier again all of
these are still applicable is now again

801
00:40:44,429 --> 00:40:46,889
does not realize that it's being
virtualized

802
00:40:46,889 --> 00:40:50,559
but again i mean email to prevent these
attacks um... and you know prevent them

803
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:54,869
not only to stop the our guest uh...
access layer but also on that the high

804
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,039
provides a

805
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:01,119
so we start looking at securing
virtualization today we look at first

806
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,739
show you know first-generation right

807
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:07,869
so you know install security on every
single gassed

808
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:09,999
you know that skills to some extent

809
00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:12,709
uh... you applying your defense and
that's all the things that we learned

810
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:16,509
from the defense in depth perspective
you know still find virtualization it

811
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:19,839
still applies in the clouds no matter
where you're out

812
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,460
you know locking down the management of
faces

813
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,859
homes are nothing new

814
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:28,189
segment the networks out would be lands

815
00:41:28,189 --> 00:41:30,980
using stand-alone security appliances
that are currently in

816
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,079
are baked in

817
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:36,429
and then we start looking at some of the
different limitations so

818
00:41:36,429 --> 00:41:41,169
you know mediums that come on in t_v_
security provisioning

819
00:41:41,169 --> 00:41:44,658
and then as we start adding on more
security obviously where we're taking up

820
00:41:44,659 --> 00:41:46,219
resources right

821
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:48,809
in the biggest thing when we start
looking at virtual zation virtualization

822
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:51,939
disposed focus with resource allocation
etcetera

823
00:41:51,939 --> 00:41:55,888
that's involved no wasn't on there with
security obscene dozens of some form of

824
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:57,839
uh... of

825
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:02,719
of uh... resource politicians are
stealing

826
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:04,509
so we start looking that

827
00:42:04,509 --> 00:42:10,819
kind of fixing this

828
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:13,389
a provider

829
00:42:13,389 --> 00:42:16,369
so all these things are did i think we
can you better from security perspective

830
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:19,409
you know how we look at how we want to
use case markman action which in

831
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:21,559
perspective

832
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:23,429
so again applying defense about

833
00:42:23,429 --> 00:42:26,619
in a shrinking imagines that

834
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:29,759
so installing security pm on every
machine

835
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:35,389
that's actually in their rights easier
to be more a_t_r_s for example

836
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:38,879
but haven't supplies no protection

837
00:42:38,879 --> 00:42:42,189
mean everything that's basically agents
right where security is not an

838
00:42:42,189 --> 00:42:45,180
afterthought right were securities out
absolutely

839
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,589
eighteen to get virtual infrastructure

840
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:50,449
you know you can't have additional
security uh...

841
00:42:50,449 --> 00:42:53,829
with tpm right which is basically
traffic and people

842
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:57,569
so basically having a multi-layered
multi-level security

843
00:42:57,569 --> 00:43:01,409
from we start looking at execute
virtualization i guess that challenge

844
00:43:01,409 --> 00:43:02,920
out to the vendors uh...

845
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,410
for us to do this is

846
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:08,049
how clean security you know into the
high provides our our in there so it's

847
00:43:08,049 --> 00:43:10,519
it's basically a genius

848
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:11,790
that's for probably

849
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:16,209
we should see security going because it
is the it takes less off the coast

850
00:43:16,209 --> 00:43:22,638
uh... security does not become an
afterthought except up

851
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:25,219
so threatened to twenty landscape

852
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:28,619
we went over that i mean he he walkways
in a lot of your public very familiar

853
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:32,559
with the threat landscape when it comes
to browser-based in server-side attacks

854
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:35,219
uh... does our problems are always going
to be growing

855
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:37,039
this cloud computing safe

856
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:41,349
uh... i would say it is that depends on
and hear using in the questions that

857
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:43,849
you're asking

858
00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:48,389
as i'll match for older gmail hotmail a
loss the messenger release a lot of us

859
00:43:48,389 --> 00:43:49,249
today

860
00:43:49,249 --> 00:43:53,279
uh... what are you willing to put up my
personal data upon the clout

861
00:43:53,279 --> 00:43:55,619
uh... you have word and

862
00:43:55,619 --> 00:44:00,069
virtualization something or something
new it's it's nothing insisted a new way

863
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:01,849
of doing computing

864
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:04,509
uh... that saves money but with that

865
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:07,869
comes additional security risk me kinda
went through those

866
00:44:07,869 --> 00:44:10,209
and then change in the security paradigm

867
00:44:10,209 --> 00:44:13,479
you know we're passing out here layered
security on everything that we build

868
00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:14,178
right

869
00:44:14,179 --> 00:44:18,499
uh... from a vendor perspective here we
gotti we gotta do that we have to do it

870
00:44:18,499 --> 00:44:20,928
a lot differently in going in the future

871
00:44:20,929 --> 00:44:24,609
and virtualization a lot of other key
components within the network

872
00:44:24,609 --> 00:44:27,819
infrastructure is important for us to
make sure that were able to change that

873
00:44:27,819 --> 00:44:31,119
that paradigm

874
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:37,849
and that's it'll take questions

875
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:39,599
e basis is because

876
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,489
some people fall asleep and some people
don't ask questions on the state on

877
00:44:42,489 --> 00:44:43,419
stage

878
00:44:43,419 --> 00:44:45,609
and help them

879
00:44:45,609 --> 00:44:48,369
so i don't have figured out a few
questions but i would ask you

880
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:50,519
i mean uvm

881
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:55,149
cloud computing virtualisation is so i
mean it's mostly for

882
00:44:55,149 --> 00:44:59,429
increasing availability care system
lowering cost per garment because burst

883
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:01,169
of does not like me

884
00:45:01,169 --> 00:45:02,618
as soon as you start

885
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:06,099
uh... increasing go ability to dole
doesn't you

886
00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:09,819
they just lower the level of security in
other areas like uh...

887
00:45:09,819 --> 00:45:13,519
confidentiality integrity stuff like
that inherently

888
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:16,769
about not really i mean when you start
at noon

889
00:45:16,769 --> 00:45:20,308
more resource sharing but it depends the
talking from a multi tenant perspective

890
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:22,119
right in the pain of crime

891
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:26,049
isolation encryption you know what's
going on i think uh...

892
00:45:26,049 --> 00:45:30,900
inherently yeah span i mean i think when
you taking consideration are are taking

893
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,240
account of the photographer

894
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,368
uh... mitigation technologies that you
could have been there

895
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:39,309
it really doesn't it with his own
lawyers acute posture communicate that

896
00:45:39,309 --> 00:45:40,219
uh...

897
00:45:40,219 --> 00:45:44,299
you have the capability for research and
service alcoholic shared memory and and

898
00:45:44,299 --> 00:45:45,669
so on and so forth

899
00:45:45,669 --> 00:45:50,788
i mean inept academically uh... brian
yessuey same resources that you can

900
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:54,589
actually grab information from a few
actually a physical assets but i think

901
00:45:54,589 --> 00:45:57,069
mister looking at macquarie perspective
i mean

902
00:45:57,069 --> 00:46:00,139
you have no idea where the resources are
coming from whether going so i mean if

903
00:46:00,139 --> 00:46:04,239
you have a secure cost postulate started
with that was biography positive

904
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:06,769
i don't think that would be property
anyway

905
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:10,390
in the event that we talked about the
motion or in the event that suspension

906
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:13,430
what your point of view virtual servers
except rep

907
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:17,089
that's we can get an instance where you
have a better picture of your security

908
00:46:17,089 --> 00:46:19,869
stance reflect this

909
00:46:19,869 --> 00:46:22,430
right and every time i see these though

910
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:25,719
flights of people believers workstation
also

911
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:28,219
uh... it does look like

912
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:30,779
you're supposed to build everything from
scratch

913
00:46:30,779 --> 00:46:33,949
i mean you can build everything with all
new components upward is that really

914
00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:35,380
real i mean doesn't

915
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,460
people just remove their existing
environment drove virtualized

916
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,519
environment bringing all the secured
from peoria panel

917
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:45,229
exactly i mean on your same security
issues that you couldn't have her

918
00:46:45,229 --> 00:46:47,009
traditional infrastructure today

919
00:46:47,009 --> 00:46:50,259
almost come over with keen in
virtualization

920
00:46:50,259 --> 00:46:53,749
but what's important to note is worth
virtualization now becomes even more

921
00:46:53,749 --> 00:46:57,479
expect at the viola palazzo both talking
about so

922
00:46:57,479 --> 00:46:59,879
you know what's really good about that
though is there's a lot of lessons

923
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,810
learned

924
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:03,339
right that we've learned that

925
00:47:03,339 --> 00:47:07,859
hour-long an information security of of
two things that we can do all right

926
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:09,859
so all those things kind of transfer

927
00:47:09,859 --> 00:47:12,689
things become the backup shouldn't have
done that we should actually be or

928
00:47:12,689 --> 00:47:14,269
mister cohen port

929
00:47:14,269 --> 00:47:18,348
and i think would clouding and alarms
talks right now it really bring security

930
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:20,119
to the forefront because

931
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:23,929
it's becoming more important just
because of the type of data that people

932
00:47:23,929 --> 00:47:26,519
are willing to place in the clout by
itself

933
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:29,678
yet you bring a lot of zinc security
problems with you and not

934
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:33,279
no talking on the world australia japan
the etcetera

935
00:47:33,279 --> 00:47:37,049
i mean shoes are a lot of questions
become active astronaut warm-up i'm

936
00:47:37,049 --> 00:47:41,119
really not return everything here it's
that's all the same what is right but i

937
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,279
think what's happening now is people
keep more of a of a strong focus on

938
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:47,579
security which is possible to me that we
have here

939
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:50,709
but it's a lessons learned that we can
actually transfer of the clouds mickey

940
00:47:50,709 --> 00:47:53,739
secure place to do business

941
00:47:53,739 --> 00:47:55,500
and also moses a

942
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,909
there has to be a lot of legal

943
00:47:57,909 --> 00:48:02,169
uh... inches spot who owns the data when
you're starting stuff and uh... starring

944
00:48:02,169 --> 00:48:04,388
the your data into clout

945
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:06,659
services i mean

946
00:48:06,659 --> 00:48:10,499
the different countries how much
differently

947
00:48:10,499 --> 00:48:13,959
bill absolutely so mean you have a lot
of different countries that talks about

948
00:48:13,959 --> 00:48:17,419
what some reports up all of the of
canada uh...

949
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:21,470
answers for tapas but none of the data
traverse the country borders right so

950
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:25,598
what what does that mean from a crop
respectable what that means is

951
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:30,329
the data centers or that's housing their
uh... their information can only reside

952
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:32,389
obscene in their country right

953
00:48:32,389 --> 00:48:35,909
but when you start looking at you know
armada county right now right collegue

954
00:48:35,909 --> 00:48:37,109
backing out at the end

955
00:48:37,109 --> 00:48:40,999
down back into it you can writes i mean
it's kind of across the border but i'm

956
00:48:40,999 --> 00:48:42,788
still using secure gilead

957
00:48:42,789 --> 00:48:46,659
it's for basically where the data
resides outward statement so

958
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:50,789
uh... there's a lot of different toward
compliance uh...

959
00:48:50,789 --> 00:48:53,980
we want to for countries how most of the
type of uh...

960
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:55,839
uh... controls in place

961
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:00,279
but out those who came to taking
considerations arsenio obviously

962
00:49:00,279 --> 00:49:03,599
working in this country or work in
luxembourg they have a good sense and

963
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,699
that's what the republican
electromechanical perspective

964
00:49:06,699 --> 00:49:08,519
you know we see that all the time
because

965
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:13,908
with an audience such services which is
basically simpson wildlife

966
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,389
that which are

967
00:49:15,389 --> 00:49:19,219
do anything in the united states and
that i want to sock analytic georgia we

968
00:49:19,219 --> 00:49:21,409
have to do things that are up in canada

969
00:49:21,409 --> 00:49:25,469
silly it changes that paradigm or a
little bit that there's been more more

970
00:49:25,469 --> 00:49:29,589
focus on rhetorical points before we see
united states he said that you can see i

971
00:49:29,589 --> 00:49:31,929
don't get picked up

972
00:49:31,929 --> 00:49:35,699
gpl a soft seems a lot of different
requirements dot

973
00:49:35,699 --> 00:49:39,679
are levied set the pain of homewood
industry purple u_n_ depends upon what

974
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:42,279
activity ucla

975
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:44,839
but as i mentioned earlier

976
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:49,489
with t_c_i_ the excessive thoughts came
outside i think it has to one

977
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:51,499
and rights

978
00:49:51,499 --> 00:49:55,058
that show me that they have all the
checks and plates but still as is still

979
00:49:55,059 --> 00:50:00,279
going to be capsules questions what
happens shipped

980
00:50:00,279 --> 00:50:03,029
that or

981
00:50:03,029 --> 00:50:06,909
uh... if they requested that will people

982
00:50:06,909 --> 00:50:08,979
don't want your too

983
00:50:08,979 --> 00:50:10,598
sisters close

984
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:13,629
awareness is always feeding the examples
go

985
00:50:13,629 --> 00:50:17,189
use we've of this city hotel security

986
00:50:17,189 --> 00:50:20,879
like no it's not our system we don't
have to care about security

987
00:50:20,879 --> 00:50:21,720
and

988
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,839
because it's in the quote

989
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,349
used by the service satish anderson

990
00:50:25,349 --> 00:50:26,729
but should care about

991
00:50:26,729 --> 00:50:28,499
secure or or greater

992
00:50:28,499 --> 00:50:30,250
and well

993
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:32,880
campbell which station

994
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,719
or shoot you an or should actually
provided

995
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:40,419
i think the but should be handled by
isolates are asking the question

996
00:50:40,419 --> 00:50:46,009
community sad securities probably an
implicit trust that they have not

997
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:50,109
it's a question that we're asking is
this policy that's not my problem right

998
00:50:50,109 --> 00:50:53,348
i mean that's why outsource everything
you take care of it i don't worry about

999
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:55,319
it

1000
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:59,429
both from security perspective just
because of securities making the news

1001
00:50:59,429 --> 00:51:03,289
more and more everyday uh... obviously
with social networking x en route

1002
00:51:03,289 --> 00:51:07,469
you know a lot of clients and i'll talk
to you are asking those questions are

1003
00:51:07,469 --> 00:51:11,439
you know in person to go back to you and
those on the democratic cetera task you

1004
00:51:11,439 --> 00:51:12,529
know wall

1005
00:51:12,529 --> 00:51:16,289
you know understandably but you know how
it's going to be secure right so in the

1006
00:51:16,289 --> 00:51:19,549
event that you keep reach than with the
selling at that

1007
00:51:19,549 --> 00:51:23,969
you know for example you know we provide
s l_a_'s for us in the event for using

1008
00:51:23,969 --> 00:51:28,579
our equipment and if you get hacked
uh... we pay out uh... statue amount of

1009
00:51:28,579 --> 00:51:31,799
money back to you rights or s_l_ answer
fairly tight

1010
00:51:31,799 --> 00:51:34,349
i think those are some of the thing i
think those are some of the questions

1011
00:51:34,349 --> 00:51:36,609
that you have to ask a lot of its
questions but

1012
00:51:36,609 --> 00:51:40,078
we when and the backing up you know we
have two eighty eight when you're right

1013
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,049
we have to twenty percent of very
technical smart people here that can ask

1014
00:51:43,049 --> 00:51:45,889
questions and understands coming back
right

1015
00:51:45,889 --> 00:51:47,769
but you have any percent back

1016
00:51:47,769 --> 00:51:50,328
would do the implicit trust

1017
00:51:50,329 --> 00:51:51,339
i think that's

1018
00:51:51,339 --> 00:51:53,649
probably what we see it

1019
00:51:53,649 --> 00:52:00,649
ask a question

1020
00:52:11,089 --> 00:52:13,379
absolute saying i've been trying to

1021
00:52:13,379 --> 00:52:18,359
formulating your question sir please
bear with me i think you're not question

1022
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:19,150
looking

1023
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:23,439
through this presentation and listening
to what you're saying we're introducing

1024
00:52:23,439 --> 00:52:26,979
a significant amount of com laxity

1025
00:52:26,979 --> 00:52:28,589
uh...

1026
00:52:28,589 --> 00:52:33,279
all this complexity requires more time
to think of how we want to plan

1027
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,050
our infrastructure how we're going to
plan on virtualisation now private

1028
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:40,819
clouds so maybe women do build public
life

1029
00:52:40,819 --> 00:52:41,859
in terms of

1030
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:44,029
money infected

1031
00:52:44,029 --> 00:52:47,159
moving too cloudy infrastructure

1032
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:49,430
all week actually reaping the benefits

1033
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:50,629
money wise

1034
00:52:50,629 --> 00:52:54,459
or are we action losing out because we
spend so much time

1035
00:52:54,459 --> 00:52:58,808
migrating talking about what we need to
do we need treatment this now because we

1036
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:01,849
need to have the in introspection
sweeney todd that was not and so forth

1037
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:03,419
and so forth

1038
00:53:03,419 --> 00:53:05,359
do you see what i'm getting at that

1039
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:08,969
you commit suck with what what happened
then

1040
00:53:08,969 --> 00:53:12,499
know that it is a good question right so
that the question is basically you know

1041
00:53:12,499 --> 00:53:16,888
communities in a lot of complexity
perturbation does that

1042
00:53:16,889 --> 00:53:18,980
but the whole thing is reducing costs
right

1043
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:22,640
i think initially he start looking at
all that i have to use that takes to do

1044
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:27,040
all the migration all set up the
planning security that's expensive right

1045
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,600
and leaders that there's an upfront cost
that you're calling and a half to small

1046
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,558
open if you look at the

1047
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:36,639
the long-term of doing it right over
several years except i think the

1048
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:40,659
cost-benefit is a lot she could could be
a lot cheaper to pain upon helping your

1049
00:53:40,659 --> 00:53:42,149
infrastructure is

1050
00:53:42,149 --> 00:53:43,909
but it's not a matter of

1051
00:53:43,909 --> 00:53:45,089
uh...

1052
00:53:45,089 --> 00:53:47,739
you know how much he point ir
infrastructure today on the floor of the

1053
00:53:47,739 --> 00:53:50,190
club but i think it's a matter of few
words

1054
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:54,630
for parts can offload in what what would
make sense right we can reduce mine my

1055
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:56,609
cap x cost because

1056
00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:59,949
what i'm seeing today just from security
perspective in talking to corporations

1057
00:53:59,949 --> 00:54:01,559
worldwide is

1058
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:05,699
dead limited money right in empower the
how they do and how they can save money

1059
00:54:05,699 --> 00:54:08,069
to where they can actually purchased
different things with this other

1060
00:54:08,069 --> 00:54:09,449
infrastructure

1061
00:54:09,449 --> 00:54:12,589
sending you bring up a good point i mean
there is a lot of complexity that this

1062
00:54:12,589 --> 00:54:15,689
brings then

1063
00:54:15,689 --> 00:54:19,459
there's a lot of of cost for picking
that uh... individuals the men and women

1064
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:22,219
that paid to move on your data out

1065
00:54:22,219 --> 00:54:24,959
i think once you have that and that's
running once you have that

1066
00:54:24,959 --> 00:54:26,799
infrastructure up and running

1067
00:54:26,799 --> 00:54:29,200
for uti expand world cedric

1068
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,328
there seems to be

1069
00:54:30,329 --> 00:54:32,059
a lot more he's here

1070
00:54:32,059 --> 00:54:34,349
but did your questioning activities

1071
00:54:34,349 --> 00:54:39,099
more someone take their virtual vision
is is grandma complexes it absolutely is

1072
00:54:39,099 --> 00:54:41,049
but i don't think there's

1073
00:54:41,049 --> 00:54:44,089
a real answer your question but i know
that you know in talking to for

1074
00:54:44,089 --> 00:54:47,558
corporations that have done it they've
done it

1075
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:51,390
artsy piecemeal at first i've never seen
any of the structures that there could

1076
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:54,259
be out there that up have taken
everything in operated

1077
00:54:54,259 --> 00:54:57,699
but what i've seen is just very little
things that the other off-loaded

1078
00:54:57,699 --> 00:55:01,349
in a lot of it was due to cost and then
understanding wall

1079
00:55:01,349 --> 00:55:05,549
i'm movin this section a bit off you
know do i have access to any more you

1080
00:55:05,549 --> 00:55:08,140
know or or am i willing to let go of
that

1081
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,490
so i'm not that answers your question
but this is that what you're doing

1082
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:13,038
within your

1083
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:14,019
i wouldn't

1084
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,689
looking for a known to cause i don't
think there is when i was just curious

1085
00:55:16,689 --> 00:55:20,200
whether when done many actual trip to
try to come to life

1086
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,189
the amount of money spent migrating and
moving in

1087
00:55:23,189 --> 00:55:27,558
ideas field but d increased complexity
that we have an old considering that

1088
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:30,449
companies today have barely understood

1089
00:55:30,449 --> 00:55:32,559
why they should have basic firewall

1090
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,179
rolf unjust the simple stuff

1091
00:55:35,179 --> 00:55:37,689
now we're talking about even more

1092
00:55:37,689 --> 00:55:39,220
complex stuff that they

1093
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,689
definitely do not understand

1094
00:55:41,689 --> 00:55:45,489
and honestly think this is a cool thing
to talk about but

1095
00:55:45,489 --> 00:55:46,789
or week actually

1096
00:55:46,789 --> 00:55:49,519
gaining anything from it

1097
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:51,720
yet and yet i i think she's

1098
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,578
united

1099
00:55:52,579 --> 00:55:56,579
it's a good question and i think there
is there is a positive gain to it

1100
00:55:56,579 --> 00:55:59,029
in you bring up a good point right i
mean

1101
00:55:59,029 --> 00:56:01,049
pharrell trite

1102
00:56:01,049 --> 00:56:04,109
i can tell you i'm a times you've been
around the world were people like that's

1103
00:56:04,109 --> 00:56:06,049
all i have been unprotected right

1104
00:56:06,049 --> 00:56:08,699
we all know that that's not not the case
right

1105
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:12,339
it's morepen educational expected
freight how do we educate the masses

1106
00:56:12,339 --> 00:56:16,299
like i said i mean everybody in this
room is in that twenty percent and we

1107
00:56:16,299 --> 00:56:19,259
can sit down to talk about the saw that
you understand that right

1108
00:56:19,259 --> 00:56:23,389
but it's the people that don't know that
in its it's consonant eugene around the

1109
00:56:23,389 --> 00:56:24,829
world war

1110
00:56:24,829 --> 00:56:27,959
you firewalls argued that this is what
you need it right though kankakee

1111
00:56:27,959 --> 00:56:31,339
virtualization is also a good right go
by the way

1112
00:56:31,339 --> 00:56:33,869
you here's all the stress that time with
it

1113
00:56:33,869 --> 00:56:34,549
so i think

1114
00:56:34,549 --> 00:56:37,538
as we start going through this i think a
lot of things that happen

1115
00:56:37,539 --> 00:56:40,099
you know it's it's gonna be education
and it's gonna be

1116
00:56:40,099 --> 00:56:44,059
great opportunities for all of us here
in the room to take that has to go out

1117
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:47,409
and basically either get that message
can or be the ones that are securing

1118
00:56:47,409 --> 00:56:49,509
this next generation infrastructures

1119
00:56:49,509 --> 00:56:52,339
i don't think it's going to go away

1120
00:56:52,339 --> 00:56:57,929
vowing that that was a good question

1121
00:56:57,929 --> 00:56:59,659
actually i was didn't just

1122
00:56:59,659 --> 00:57:05,399
in terms of uh... just to give you a
little bit of analysis on it that's a we

1123
00:57:05,399 --> 00:57:08,739
in the u_s_ we've been fighting there
probably we could have about seventy

1124
00:57:08,739 --> 00:57:11,359
percent savings on at work

1125
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:15,569
and in terms of that week virtualized
most environments

1126
00:57:15,569 --> 00:57:18,729
it's because of different amounts of
overhead

1127
00:57:18,729 --> 00:57:23,729
so i mean that's that's usually the
basis that we use for virtualization

1128
00:57:23,729 --> 00:57:26,058
and then yet then you take

1129
00:57:26,059 --> 00:57:29,029
uh... punch it if the matter things and
you sort of say well

1130
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:34,149
is to be the complexity but i mean etc
still leaves you if you if you take

1131
00:57:34,149 --> 00:57:37,089
three or four years out the paid for it

1132
00:57:37,089 --> 00:57:40,029
then you suddenly have all that money
for security or other things do you

1133
00:57:40,029 --> 00:57:46,009
wanna folks and

1134
00:57:46,009 --> 00:57:53,009
let's get an email polishing mister

1135
00:57:58,459 --> 00:57:59,649
it thank you john pierce
