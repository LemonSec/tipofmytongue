1
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,589
s uh... knowing it

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,519
the only time that uh... somebody's
gonna find out what's

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:09,510
when alice

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,709
fire gets her uh...

5
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:14,488
statement since he had she didn't return

6
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:15,789
two thousand dollars now

7
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:19,230
whether she's going to remember where
she was too much about the newspaper or

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,259
lunch uh... that's a different story but
uh...

9
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:26,460
uh... this is all the the really attack
works

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,769
so we've got mister and mr

11
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,100
to the b_b_c_ and figure two thousand
seven between two stores and in

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,000
cambridge

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,080
as a bookstore

14
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,920
and restaurant initially the video of
the videos are a bit corny because

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,420
they're made for

16
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,940
for the white audience

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,970
but uh... i think that there are
important for the complex especially the

18
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,780
part about of people not getting their
money back when uh... fraud does happen

19
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:57,780
because of japan

20
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,080
allowed it is a well life in the office
where tonight as in this incoming is

21
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,539
watchdog is asking if responsive plane
fare when someone steals money from your

22
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,770
account unless it is your fault lines i
will say that they should give you the

23
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,310
money back but most of you have told us
that that's not always what happens

24
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,230
that evening you and is also the with
its

25
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,409
yet you can think of that when these two
men last year

26
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:33,550
everyone says so could be correct

27
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,090
waits till you see what we've been able
to do

28
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:43,090
ordinary high street that's coming up
later

29
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,350
if someone stole your bike ka uses this
to eliminate from your account believe

30
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,509
that uh... therefore

31
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,070
because you're talking to him and back

32
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,960
with massive fines

33
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,020
enough to settle the issue of fall

34
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,640
using messages

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,890
for the only way someone could take it

36
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,810
isn't

37
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,299
this is a chicken pickup

38
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:14,710
do you think six million editors the
president transactions

39
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,709
more secure

40
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:18,060
the irony is that when things do their
own

41
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,189
and i was slightly less the tactic that
will work before

42
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:24,209
proving

43
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:27,809
that you don't feel as a transaction
involved producing

44
00:02:27,809 --> 00:02:30,179
the piece of paper with your signature

45
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:32,540
it was relatively easy

46
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,059
if we want to know

47
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:36,478
with the u_n_ authorized it will not

48
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,099
the banks have introduced a system of
the pain

49
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:42,999
which simply takes that proof away

50
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:47,019
and a possible signature had been forced
by law the banks have to hang out

51
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,869
but there is no little to come up in
transactions

52
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,799
the anything protecting the consumer is
the bank and trust

53
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:58,379
quality care to practice to go back to
signed up to

54
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,578
banking says is that the banks approved
couldn't thing that isn't

55
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:06,799
not that i have to get your money back
that's the last thing happening

56
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:08,599
system containing

57
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:12,809
it doesn't need to prove things done
nothing wrong

58
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:15,189
everything about six thousand hotline

59
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:17,589
is because they seemed to fit in

60
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:20,029
is unpredictable that's the wrong

61
00:03:20,029 --> 00:03:23,849
whenever these one-way that it may
contain honorable

62
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:28,078
these games university researcher
stephen song past shows that they can

63
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,050
access to be in the nation

64
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,369
from somebody else's com

65
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:34,369
is the victim

66
00:03:34,369 --> 00:03:36,589
one of our team about to pay for his
lungs

67
00:03:36,589 --> 00:03:40,469
it's going to prove that the expensive

68
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:44,129
in a good shot a few goes down the road
steven is waiting to hijack used to

69
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:45,668
contain details

70
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:51,689
you'll be using a fake on leads to a
computer hidden in this fact

71
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,358
stephen hess of the conference

72
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:55,129
so i was looking at the cafe

73
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:57,689
where he's tampered with the to contain
the seeds

74
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:59,759
instead of sending information to the
bank

75
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,458
comcast will be sent wirelessly to the
computer in the back

76
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:07,279
instead

77
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:11,429
ready to go sounds exhausting the
bookshelf is in position to make his own

78
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:12,610
patches

79
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,909
it's more expensive

80
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:18,498
but he doesn't plan to use his own money

81
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:20,700
adjustment cafe keys in his pain

82
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,558
to pay his firepower bail

83
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:28,449
as he does said his chittenden details
automatically sent to steven

84
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:31,559
mexican forces

85
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:35,560
fiennes is the hijackings by his books

86
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,350
it's all gone through but the chip at
atp and be back by the time of in the

87
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,580
book shop to determine the cafe thinks
he spent five

88
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,050
that is confidential fifteen pounds

89
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,989
he won't be able to prove he didn't
spending

90
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:53,239
the chip and it is not one hundred
percent secure then the banks should not

91
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:56,280
be turning down compensation planes from
its customers

92
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,710
on the basis that the system

93
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,340
cannot be b

94
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,128
used it with the customer

95
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:03,290
rejects the transaction

96
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:08,870
the banks first response is really quite
extreme looks to see if the pit was used

97
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,959
individuals it says it must be the
customers falls

98
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,239
without considering

99
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:17,049
any of them possibilities i think

100
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:24,049
that is what most

101
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,389
monsters

102
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:29,379
uh...

103
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:34,449
here

104
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:36,180
so character

105
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,409
you will start as a consumer watch
program for mentioned uh...

106
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:46,270
and generate court for printers
inspection

107
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,240
uh...

108
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,500
or all the whole detox and then talk
about the were

109
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,910
uh... later used as evidence in court
when people do

110
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,099
uh...

111
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:56,520
uh...

112
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:03,520
when people dispute that banks decisions
not to give them the money back

113
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:07,680
so this is the tape that that uh... we
use

114
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,279
uh... you saw the determine on the left
where uh...

115
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,520
basically

116
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,979
article the internal

117
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:20,949
uh... circuitry from consignment put in
a fugitive borden to control the keypad

118
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:24,009
the l_c_d_ and the smart card

119
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,479
uh... reader

120
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:28,329
and then sis connected to the pc

121
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:33,709
and we've made it uh... play tetris just
to to show that it's uh... it's complete

122
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:35,770
under our control the

123
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,438
video considers and looked at the bottom

124
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,419
uh... so we have we have a completely
fake

125
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:43,180
criminal

126
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,699
it's it's a it's a big old and uh... but
uh... the idea is that

127
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,310
customers cartilage can't know what is
the real time and should look like

128
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,400
they're not trained and shouldn't be
trained to do that

129
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,339
so um...

130
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:01,279
therefore and and promote would do

131
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,339
and uh... for the fake or if you see in
the top right

132
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:07,650
ordered it wasn't in

133
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,979
uh... real card

134
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:12,299
and i'm derek ground around the park oxy
resin

135
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,459
roan to too

136
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:19,529
to disconnect the the uh... the wire
bonds

137
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:21,889
until the the contact pads

138
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:24,779
are exposed sorter button wires

139
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,840
onto those pants from that

140
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,279
and crossed

141
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,440
uh... person

142
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,180
onto the plastic with uh... with that
with tonight

143
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,849
so and the and strike you don't see
anything

144
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:37,750
and actor dword

145
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,080
uh... to that to the became instead out
there

146
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,330
and you can see stevens and there

147
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,430
uh... putting it putting the cart into
the terminal note this is ok when u

148
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,870
uh... instantly the wire comes down

149
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,539
uh... to the uh... to give jay board in
the back that

150
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,719
but uh... justin and the

151
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,850
both the cut customer

152
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,689
are trained to to put that to put to
hide the pain entry

153
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:09,570
and the returns was to went nuts purcell
component and so worked up here on uh...

154
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:14,279
uh... the wire works out even though it
won't be that difficult to

155
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:19,009
to reverser fortresses reverser without
the wire

156
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:22,050
so this was just a demonstration or
became

157
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,240
uh... does some real time ah...
processing of the data

158
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,809
and also transplants known

159
00:08:30,809 --> 00:08:31,669
there

160
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:34,960
the envy of the ice or seven oh one six
two

161
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,099
to uh... r street thirty two
disconnected to the laptop where

162
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:40,700
remorse often

163
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:46,110
the software for doing the actual really
happens

164
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,520
dole cost of about five hundred box

165
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:55,520
uh... of personal artwork to tops mother
engineering skills status persecuted

166
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,010
uh... to do it

167
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:02,810
so we can come into the a defense
against this is world considered about

168
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:07,199
this is an on site on a per tonight's
ascribe deeper great detail

169
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,440
what would it allows uh... support
formal

170
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,890
which is called the perfor

171
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:18,310
uh... send single it challenges and mc
single bit response from the hoover

172
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,209
the card

173
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:23,090
and based on the flight time the the
round trip time

174
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:27,670
the verifier can't put a cap on the
uh... maximum distance away that you

175
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,299
will

176
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:31,840
uh... expect approval to be

177
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,370
and uh... again this was implemented on
the kitchen and um...

178
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:41,110
and artist no used for

179
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:45,580
uh... karar parking more spoon

180
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,800
uh... it's questionable whether the
banks have been and adopted city

181
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,709
needs and what minor modification
student vj to chip

182
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:57,179
and some more cheers modifications to
the terminal

183
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,569
this is one solution

184
00:09:58,569 --> 00:10:00,279
intentionally went out today

185
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:04,380
uh... there's nothing to prevent it

186
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,650
someone going to move on to

187
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,840
uh... computer card fraud

188
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,460
and again you see the different two
thousand four

189
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,320
and no

190
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,820
criminals out of that

191
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,020
uh...

192
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,329
when things that so that the stern
produced a preps like

193
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:27,949
is that uh... humvee is a bulldozer it
moves crime around a dozen really

194
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:29,030
eliminated

195
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:33,709
so what happened was that uh...

196
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,020
at texas a criminal's continues

197
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,930
uh... the are expected cloned

198
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:45,959
in the u_k_ anymore because it dat ends
required uh... required chip

199
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,130
so they just

200
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,880
dividend countries that don't delete dat
until departure

201
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,559
so uh...

202
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,329
the banks are trying to claim that
there's less frogs summaries record

203
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:57,289
score

204
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,480
just moved crime around

205
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,230
uh... eliminate

206
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,390
so again uh...

207
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,189
crime crimes of

208
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:15,190
uh... court orders uh... or corporate
partners is cleaning up again

209
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,939
unrestricted

210
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,090
artur

211
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:49,510
uh... i don't know

212
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:54,200
you've got to get you have to protect it
uh... still may be a tension internment

213
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,329
detector

214
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:57,540
elsewhere

215
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,360
uh...

216
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,890
uh... content they deserve these are
figures only for the u_k_ uh...

217
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,689
weakened atemu outward

218
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:11,520
uh... with mckinsey and company

219
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,300
uh... so so they are saying is to see

220
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,439
of security intrigued by systems
instruments green or

221
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,080
uh... into how secure are very

222
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,110
and

223
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:27,050
remember i said that the u_k_ issued
uh... parts of delinquent the pin

224
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,120
and the

225
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,150
overreaction units going back and forth
with introspection

226
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,310
so if you can go to if you can

227
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,810
objects and

228
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,520
and diario and card

229
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,010
and the u

230
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,939
record the data you'll get everything
you need in order to create a fake

231
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,029
omitted strict version of the card

232
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:53,680
and using it and that doesn't have to
print

233
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,640
so

234
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,750
we wanted to see if ur

235
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,540
if that works

236
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,870
but the the pets are are all certified
by various uh... or bodies standard

237
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,629
bodies he's uh... apex m_c_i_

238
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:09,780
uh... in princeton and

239
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:14,900
uh... evaluated to common prettier than
actually not com criteria certified

240
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,140
uh...

241
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,420
homecoming party valuing which is an
interesting point

242
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,560
on and on this uh... certification
scheme

243
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,260
and uh...

244
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:30,770
visa for instance requires that these
pets will be it will require twenty five

245
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,980
thousand dollars

246
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,070
per pack

247
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:37,930
to circumvent the security of the temper
prefer mechanisms and so that means it's

248
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,880
not a one-off uh...

249
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,750
investment

250
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,340
you will have to invest twenty five
thousand dollars

251
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,430
everytime you compromise one of these
things

252
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,579
i've got some uh...

253
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,630
but you of needs of

254
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,160
uh... energy bunches of debate about ten
dollars each

255
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,510
and

256
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,980
uh... try to see it

257
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,040
if these used to meet

258
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,339
and practice the returns vote for

259
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,400
restricted for sale

260
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,480
and uh... there are the most popular
opinion to devices in the u_k_

261
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,910
uh... samantha about fifty percent of
the

262
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,420
into two parts market is as shared
between these two

263
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,689
uh... the one on the right is being
phased out but the one leftist and being

264
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,160
used

265
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,209
and

266
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,889
so this is the dollar on

267
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:28,390
uh... the one on the right

268
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,990
you can see uh... of resistance

269
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,020
uh... had

270
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,129
pressing onto capacitive structure

271
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:38,280
in order to connect to trace

272
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,140
that world

273
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,150
uh... once once the opens

274
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,000
gang gate that uh...

275
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,540
federal incorporate

276
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,769
and the temper detection mechanism will
trigger

277
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:51,610
and the sequence

278
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,540
were stored in the incidents security
module

279
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,480
we will erase essentially the keys that
belonged to communicate with the bed

280
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,690
uh... wouldn't you go see there there is
actually the uh...

281
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,730
to parents

282
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,280
that uh... uh...

283
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,750
you came

284
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,000
in parallel to the capacity structures
and if you could if you can

285
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,109
if you uh...

286
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:16,940
drool you can't you can't connect it
won't fit defeats

287
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,190
it's uh...

288
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,460
missiles northward

289
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,060
this is the internet one

290
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,510
and you can see uh... switch

291
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,450
there there is a better picture of her

292
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,380
uh... it's it's a switch

293
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,640
with the torrent they're discussing onto
the switch justin image but it's close

294
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,380
emotional content again

295
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:39,610
the uh... temperate uh... for protection
mechanisms that trigger

296
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,589
these are

297
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:41,760
um...

298
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:47,170
forecasted structures that are being
press

299
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,790
these parents as as been

300
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,589
it is whilst working with children

301
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,630
uh...

302
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,670
uh...

303
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,670
the desert desert

304
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,459
uh... resisted as

305
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,460
repressed in the close the circuit was
it's open to me and the trigger

306
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,380
mechanisms to uh... your expertise

307
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,860
this is the that's which has been
pressed it's protected by a wall

308
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,569
against reeling from the back

309
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:15,729
sold this view from the back and i'll
show you another picture with the

310
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,709
compartment

311
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,920
that uh... user sensible

312
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,540
and

313
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,640
if you drink through this

314
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,500
in order to get to the switch again
don't trigger

315
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,720
the entire circuit board has any

316
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,570
uh... sensors

317
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,079
as one layer and that's again to prevent
ruling from the back

318
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,209
in to get to the processor

319
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,030
this is the cost of water

320
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:45,420
it's uh... identity xref scastro with
uh... with ramesh

321
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,459
assessors

322
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,240
and uh... imparted this is approxi
residents it's uh...

323
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,130
the

324
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,950
uh... plastic covering

325
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,829
this is where the main processor lives
this is where

326
00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:00,019
the protection uh... circuit

327
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,150
uh... is

328
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,459
and users worked

329
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,670
and they go away once uh...

330
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,860
oneself instrument

331
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,488
this is the darial

332
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:11,990
uh...

333
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,209
uh... quibbling

334
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:17,510
and keypad is on the other sites of the
entire the keypad

335
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,470
the uh...

336
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,209
uses circuitry

337
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:23,319
is uh...

338
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,369
is part of it

339
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:28,409
what's interesting to note here is that
i was able to to get such a clear

340
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,950
view of the chip

341
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,030
is because they put a sticker on it
before the positive

342
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,389
so you can grow and uh... granted down
court coarsely

343
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,620
and then you get to the two stickers
peeling off

344
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,510
and uh... you can see the end and
information

345
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,200
which process using is quite useful

346
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,559
this is the oscillator

347
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,120
all of these mechanisms

348
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,139
art can be circumvented with the paper
clip

349
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,630
and nato

350
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,799
uh...

351
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,660
to do to do printing up to you

352
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,520
looking at this uh...

353
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,040
at uh... the underway

354
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,210
so here you see the only thing that is
really needed is to create a new hole in

355
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,630
the plastic this is the the user
sensible compartment

356
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,159
distancing trigger anything

357
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:17,150
uh... you opening screw

358
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,880
and you can close it nobody will notice

359
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,750
uh...

360
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,480
this is a very difficult

361
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,380
that we send something to do you can
uh...

362
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,190
for certain things and torrents of the
plastic

363
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:33,110
and uh... connected to to the allied of
the card

364
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:36,729
and you can put in the circuit insight
with built the circuit doesn't quite fit

365
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,680
it's almost expected stuffed shells but
you can cut uh...

366
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,000
crater custom hardware that would fit
inside here will records

367
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,550
lets me transactions as you walked and
nobody will notice because

368
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:54,899
designers provided you with the disc
nice compartment to put it in

369
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,700
uh...

370
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,020
the other distinctive note is that

371
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,879
uh... i showed you before two p

372
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,680
there is a sense ramesh

373
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,840
to prevent uh... to prevent really this
is the front sight

374
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,959
and this is the backside to fight drug i
will get uh... the mechanisms triggered

375
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,960
but uh...

376
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,080
melting

377
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,500
uh... so much tension shots

378
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,490
i've never seen a motive but don't let
the actually do not forget eight

379
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,549
it holes

380
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:40,080
uh...

381
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,159
promoting the slots here

382
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,740
and here

383
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,809
and here

384
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,350
and through the list

385
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,289
i was able to insert a clip

386
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:52,190
that clicked onto the underlying

387
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:56,130
it's it's uh... they went through all
the trouble of creating a sense ramesh

388
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,900
throughout the board

389
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:03,270
somebody proportionate

390
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,168
enough talk about the reasons why this
happened

391
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:08,640
uh... leader

392
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,260
yet this is the yet that one

393
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,650
personal stuck in your through

394
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,220
anything that's one of these pages as a
ribbon cable

395
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,850
uh... connector

396
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:23,080
and open it to the audio it's very nice
because it's not for two points

397
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,629
when

398
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:29,590
uh... european their initial poker
hookah wire in there

399
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:35,199
uh... correct and you get the or entire
transaction

400
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,429
we've seen that the tepper protection
protects the did

401
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:42,009
executes quite well

402
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:42,720
but not

403
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,350
deal doing you know

404
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,840
uh... protects we need to protect the
carvel ends and

405
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,730
and uh... and card details uh... almost
at all

406
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,950
so again we saw this uh... to the bbc

407
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,390
when the syphilis

408
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,040
director really and show up

409
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,760
and uh...

410
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,629
this is a response from a picture
standpoint

411
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,150
and says set that said that uh... this
isn't practical

412
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,440
you've got it but like they always do
they say that this is only possible and

413
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,809
and the lapd not uh... high street

414
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,110
uh... yet

415
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,360
uh... criminals have been doing this and
sister act two thousand six and it was

416
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,340
uh...

417
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:28,209
uh... widely publicized case of an irish
guy going into a supermarket and tried

418
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,399
to do almost

419
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:32,668
except that i don't know exactly the
tools written trip to

420
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:34,120
tampered with the pace

421
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,030
so we'll show you the uh... the video of
that

422
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,730
uh...

423
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,020
in the u_k_ there's a guy called jeremy
taxman

424
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,940
and he's uh...

425
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,580
he is the anchor

426
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,350
of program called inside

427
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:54,070
and he's known for a not letting go of
his interviews until they answer him

428
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:59,610
and it's quite fun to sing and crew of
the actually

429
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,699
so

430
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:08,700
and writes

431
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,360
still spaces assistantship

432
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,740
ping pong kenya

433
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,370
code number retirees to credit or debit
card is becoming a big with this the

434
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:37,350
great involved if we were told was that
it had stuffed with security protection

435
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:41,620
how could anyone still for those if only
we knew the numbers which would make up

436
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,570
our function

437
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:48,129
what's reports it seems to embody by the
way while with following the spy's our

438
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,170
cameraman

439
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:52,600
fell victim to the fourteen withdrawal
of a thousand pounds from his account by

440
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,590
someone

441
00:22:53,590 --> 00:23:00,590
in serbia

442
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:13,539
these gloves intact future devices all
parents

443
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:18,370
which semen samples of debate for around
thirty pounds giving them free reign to

444
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,889
explore the inner workings of each
device

445
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:26,169
this long is made by a company
ingentaconnect as among the most common

446
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:33,169
passed in houston u_k_ stores today in
shops including these asta andy kohut

447
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,449
referral

448
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,050
ways in which

449
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,590
we can get into that interface between
the card

450
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,330
and the processor and were able to

451
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:46,179
read the as as it went back and forth

452
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:50,150
it's all simply theory these tests our
clients

453
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:55,710
the real test is whether the attack
works for sector

454
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:00,040
away from their weapons we've compiled
the cambridge june with a lot of matches

455
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,040
machine

456
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,408
real quick all to test out is there

457
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:11,200
let's get the transaction

458
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,260
when option his account it is just as
we've been helpful not to share any

459
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,859
potential salsa

460
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:23,859
enough that they carrying out this time

461
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,030
so there would be fair

462
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,120
the

463
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:39,299
solicitous mcgrath of the name of the
top of that their account number obtain

464
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:41,370
bitterness mutual

465
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:46,129
demonstrated that it's easy to get the
pins world as the companies are

466
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,990
didn't so

467
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,450
this means that simply holding you

468
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:56,650
with world's but also what cannot defend
himself or herself

469
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:59,510
non-surpluses therefore we are

470
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:04,169
truly bright spots responsibility until
election internals can be easily

471
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,429
compromise

472
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:09,990
potential should not be at home at the
backs of lead customer

473
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:14,680
aznar knocked out about chicken pain
because to be on the banks themselves to

474
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,060
come up with the evidence but it was the
customer are not the security of ashes

475
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,020
inconsistent that was the fault

476
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:27,110
was not a selva queen all a past which
is the uh... trade voting represented

477
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,320
post pieces uses

478
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,700
how many should've been machines only
britain a two million we happen to

479
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,090
connect devices

480
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,820
uh... important things stressed from
this case

481
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,129
is that we're not talking about the
growth of the champion secure fearful

482
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,360
well there

483
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,070
according to the we certainly are what
it is intended to machine so

484
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,279
this is an automatically

485
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,159
but the important thing to stress these
exactly what ten fifteen in sunset

486
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:57,020
is it difficult for to do that to
replicate in large scale

487
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,879
selected by twice a whole debate

and uh...

551
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:58,980
criminals are using simple techniques
such as fish and game killers

552
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,370
if you are

so uh... attempt for example into a
serial number

569
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,279
and you have to send

570

form

571
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,749

00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:55,609
and ill ask you for a number of uh... in
philosophy for the for coder that or

573
00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:57,740
sponsor serial number you put that in

574
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:01,059
and in it's another form of of center

575
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:02,809
being uh...

576
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:04,470
uh... more sure of that

577
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:09,510
you processed something else is uh...
not just correct details

578
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,950
uh...

579
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:16,040
but this this could be this could be
defeated the fire for fishing website

580
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,580
starts asking for and templeton what's
your

581
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,789
uh...

582
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:24,169
and other places uh... making you enter

585
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,010
uh... don't get that

586
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:36,919
uh... direct number no uh... also if
this is done in real-time than uh...

587
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:39,500
depends cricket

588
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,900
so uh... millwork and uh...

589
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,149
help rosters against these uh... these
types of attack

590
00:30:46,149 --> 00:30:47,340
uh... men in the middle

591
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,439
or combination uh... research issued
more

592
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,419
is uh... man and the browser

593
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:55,320
this is where you get uh...

594
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,770
well describe it didn't but later
produced and uh... what was it was to

595
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,850
have something in in your browser was
sick of malware

596
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:04,330
uh... these obstetric uh...

597
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:08,990
uh... mechanisms for tensions to spell

598
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,480
so this is uh... the man in the browser

599
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,490
where

600
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:14,920
uh...

601
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,580
than men

602
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,499
in your browser sits between

603
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:21,370
which is displayed to you and the
connection with the bank

604
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:26,158
and show you everything into it asks for
approved

605
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,790
and you put in putting the code but

606
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,260
the uh... the evil man it will change

607
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,680
the count the target account number

608
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,679
and

609
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:37,660
uh... then transfer the money out

610
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,990
he wrote this this is possible because

611
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:40,999
the quote

612
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,809
isn't cartoon transaction there's no

613
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:46,690
people transaction indication

614
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:52,700
uh... and contains the destinations and
the american in in real time

615
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,360
and any on

616
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,879
will be uh...

617
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,940
will work

618
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,820
now in court

619
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:04,230
any good at that particular time work
and give

620
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:07,239
uh... clever enough to continue
statement

621
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:11,279
your online banking statement such that
you won't be able to protect our how

622
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,220
much money actually went out for while

623
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:23,220
uh... truly parents or of judaism really
unpopular these things and uh...

624
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,799
in order to prevent

625
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,539
that uh... one

626
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:28,799
into too

627
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,649
make it more difficult than they put a
capture

628
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,709
and ten request

629
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:37,620
so no it requires a person direction
look at it

630
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,370
uh... in real time

631
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,439
as answer during the attack

632
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,650
soon will make some more difficult than

633
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,899
probably moves

634
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,570
moves ah... the attack to

635
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:49,668
uh...

636
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:52,600
the sisters too

637
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:58,230
uh... use other parents considers that's

638
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:01,860
so in the u_k_ did you start to deploy
these in

639
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,570
uh... is disconnected card readers

640
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:07,779
and sculptured authentication program

641
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:13,419
and it's a protocol

642
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:16,039
uh... expense and uh... unit b

643
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:17,370
and

644
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,159
uh... with which is open

645
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:25,120
so we took it apart re reversing two
years uh... everything that distinct us

646
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,409
with the

647
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,320
to right

648
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,279
that we had

649
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:30,090
uh... from previous and

650
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:33,689
uh... at that

651
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,940
and

652
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:40,120
uh... and talk about some some dishes
and with the client

653
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,800
the way works to use it

654
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,649
used a recession online banking session

655
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:48,879
and u

656
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,419
according to the card reader

657
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:52,649
and into the pain

658
00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:54,639
and content the

659
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:56,248
the reader farrakhan's and

660
00:33:56,249 --> 00:34:00,019
and i'll tell you it's it's correct or
not if it's not that will continue loma

661
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:02,970
correct continued and was correct

662
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:07,179
then personal interest the transaction
details about the parents

663
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,629
the contracts and

664
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,929
uh... mold

665
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:12,509
the car corporate america

666
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:15,779
over character or transaction

667
00:34:15,779 --> 00:34:19,029
character of cartons monotonically
increasing

668
00:34:19,029 --> 00:34:22,009
of such that uh... exit signals

669
00:34:22,009 --> 00:34:22,909
and

670
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:25,760
uh... information is entered by the
customer

671
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,119
and some information

672
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,129
depending on the market is displayed

673
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:31,839
on the uh... on the web form

674
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:36,529
and also the result of in comparison
wasn't that bad

675
00:34:36,529 --> 00:34:39,509
and the regards displaced a decimal
value

676
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:41,679
that is made up some parts of the
counter

677
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,460
so and the banking and

678
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:49,800
you can simply most character showed
it's intended to be consistent

679
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,399
to know what this with the state of the
conference

680
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:56,098
because sometimes you'll get out object

681
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:59,380
and some parts of the next unit america
there's a mask

682
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,880
and supply and we know them reread we
figured out the markets and it's in the

683
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,039
paper here

684
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,660
that you're next

685
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,598
uh...

686
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:12,930
here arth remotes

687
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:17,479
but the cap uses identify response i
identified as a require any

688
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:22,089
anything else from from the user exit
intrigued interest code disappears

689
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:26,078
there is uh... responded with with
challenge it's called the number

690
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,849
and deciding which is the destination
account number ref

691
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:32,069
and amount

692
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:34,239
when students are not very descriptive

693
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,469
so

694
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:41,619
accruals can use this to their advantage
of and character get the

695
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:46,529
customers to put in data in the wrong
order or do a very various things

696
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:50,819
uh... it's just it's just bad that for
his ability and that for security

697
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:54,119
uh... that ambiguity

698
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,309
to bear to look at barclays

699
00:35:56,309 --> 00:36:01,259
they asked for identify from logging
login and site for to do a transaction

700
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:02,889
networks and the other hand

701
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:04,799
uh... doesn't require

702
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:06,729
uh...

703
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:08,589
for morgan

704
00:36:08,589 --> 00:36:10,058
users following

705
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:15,239
uh... with uh... four digits of the
forum peterson last four digits of the

706
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,469
bank account party back account

707
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:20,109
uh...

708
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:23,710
did difference between this is these is
confusing

709
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:28,380
biopsy equity western involving
sometimes i get a warning

710
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,540
to tell me that

711
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,790
action never

712
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,009
used a cat

713
00:36:32,009 --> 00:36:33,749
for our login

714
00:36:33,749 --> 00:36:37,459
so apparently uh... some someone

715
00:36:37,459 --> 00:36:40,750
was uh... if there are out fishing
attacks

716
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,109
that pretend to be a nat west bank site

717
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:45,379
that asks for forms

718
00:36:45,379 --> 00:36:47,729
as as login

719
00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:51,549
so they're warning people uh... against
that but i think that with the two basic

720
00:36:51,549 --> 00:36:52,730
can be confused

721
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:55,019
because parking stubs require

722
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:57,649
uh... at cap codes for

723
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:01,069
for uh... login

724
00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:02,389
uh...

725
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:03,369
the other

726
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:05,749
director type

727
00:37:05,749 --> 00:37:10,769
the mood isn't part of the met which can
be problematic because assign response

728
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:14,839
with an empty or zero amount is also
going to respond

729
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:20,279
uh... response which could also abused
by criminals

730
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,050
and

731
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:23,549
you don't feel this overloaded

732
00:37:23,549 --> 00:37:28,330
and it being also both amounts in one
mode and the destination account

733
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,308
member in another

734
00:37:30,309 --> 00:37:34,029
so that could create problems

735
00:37:34,029 --> 00:37:37,979
sore practical attack on on uh... using
cap

736
00:37:37,979 --> 00:37:41,578
because uh... some some some banks like
barclays

737
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:46,619
uh... don't don't require norse or of
merchandise

738
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:47,529
uh...

739
00:37:47,529 --> 00:37:50,029
the we can collect

740
00:37:50,029 --> 00:37:51,579
quotes

741
00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:55,749
continues and later as long as the as
long as the parking didn't want to add

742
00:37:55,749 --> 00:37:56,759
to that backing

743
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,949
almanac was called long left about

744
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:04,109
so we can use our victorino struck

745
00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:05,919
and when the

746
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:08,959
cardholders was replaced for it

747
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:11,930
capturing object because we've we have

748
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:16,089
we have reverse engineered the of what
the capitals

749
00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:19,449
so we just running its just cold running
on pc

750
00:38:19,449 --> 00:38:22,650
so we generate all these quotes mohan
uh...

751
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:26,840
either in real time are we yes unless
these records that you know it to

752
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,079
somebody else or do it ourselves

753
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:32,039
we can now walk into the back

754
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:34,960
to the due to the online account

755
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,910
we do need some more information we need
to me

756
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,058
uh...

757
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:42,060
uh... login names that could be finished
by

758
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,750
calling the person in essence anaheim
from the bank security

759
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,190
you just change it

760
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,270
this and that because

761
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,509
displays linux

762
00:38:50,509 --> 00:38:54,489
to to show that we uh... we know we were
talking about and we're asking them for

763
00:38:54,489 --> 00:38:57,809
that for that login name which is in
secret

764
00:38:57,809 --> 00:39:00,629
uh... the banks tell you that isn't so

765
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:01,749
uh...

766
00:39:01,749 --> 00:39:06,640
we've actually done this uh... program
for the b_b_c_ and uh... chilling couple

767
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,500
weeks

768
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:12,069
it works

769
00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:17,000
the captain also uh... trade show
criminals deserve street current

770
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,479
uh...

771
00:39:18,479 --> 00:39:23,038
because now they have a device that they
can verify that you've uh...

772
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:26,429
uh... giving them the right kind of at
that might be

773
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:28,099
uh... before they had

774
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,659
tribute to an a_t_m_ and try to

775
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:34,999
uh... get attention right and no interim
street corner

776
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:37,149
and um...

777
00:39:37,149 --> 00:39:42,509
but and we have we know of two cases
where people have in uh... tortured and

778
00:39:42,509 --> 00:39:43,249
killed

779
00:39:43,249 --> 00:39:45,470
foreigner from the bank details

780
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,729
uh... i i don't know of any cases of
people using kath

781
00:39:48,729 --> 00:39:50,279
uh...

782
00:39:50,279 --> 00:39:54,769
but they can get some change though it
could also change the people are would

783
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:58,959
be tortured like that i don't know
profound changes and opened

784
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:02,470
uh... how costume crime and can be
performed because

785
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:05,589
it was always possible to construct one
of these devices that will verify

786
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:06,519
content

787
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:08,839
but this was a design mistake recruiters

788
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,029
made the reader

789
00:40:10,029 --> 00:40:11,819
continue regardless

790
00:40:11,819 --> 00:40:14,189
of within in was correct or not

791
00:40:14,189 --> 00:40:16,040
and just generated

792
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,808
accord everytime

793
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:21,819
uh... refuted enrolled the code will be
incorrect so what

794
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,058
uh... words since the

795
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:26,339
stop when innocent correct

796
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:30,099
uh... they created this is this uh...
opportunity for criminals to use this

797
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:33,559
device and streets

798
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:36,099
uh... the supply chains can also be

799
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:40,069
care infiltrator their reefer cases
uh...

800
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:44,089
about a year ago where personal to use a
month ago

801
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:47,670
uh... inserted into financial devices at
manufacture time

802
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,379
and it collected

803
00:40:49,379 --> 00:40:55,199
card details and uh... ascendant through
the semester somewhere in pakistan

804
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:58,730
and the only way they detected it is by
uh... some uh... uh...

805
00:40:58,730 --> 00:40:59,400
some

806
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,750
garden supermarket

807
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,710
to have some interference which is phone
and somehow

808
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,719
uh... they figured out that something is
wrong

809
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:09,179
and and they had to go through too

810
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:12,179
recall the supermarkets arnold places
they use these

811
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:14,769
uh... interest not thing is that one

812
00:41:14,769 --> 00:41:16,499
but uh...

813
00:41:16,499 --> 00:41:21,390
and have to wait and because uh... don't
be other with the g_s_a_ margins or a

814
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,650
hundred grams more

815
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,719
the grand champion

816
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:28,209
because they can't open it in order for
them to get their go away

817
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:31,209
the the become useless

818
00:41:31,209 --> 00:41:34,269
so this is uh... supply chain of
character and you could do it with

819
00:41:34,269 --> 00:41:35,270
capital

820
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,970
the big story that you can use in your
cat because there's nothing in it

821
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:41,399
that uh... it's personal to you

822
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:43,170
so

823
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,829
uh...

824
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:48,449
one tech is that i could talk to tamper
with one of those things and so on and

825
00:41:48,449 --> 00:41:49,519
you great

826
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:51,319
and then

827
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:52,299
you will use it

828
00:41:52,299 --> 00:41:53,220
for a while

829
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:57,399
it lasted for a while bunch of details
like can walk in a minute other things

830
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,039
that

831
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:01,409
heart related really required but you
don't know

832
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:04,999
and then we'll stop working and also
your coverage for the morning here and

833
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:06,689
send it back to me

834
00:42:06,689 --> 00:42:09,049
and indicated that dot

835
00:42:09,049 --> 00:42:12,239
uh... harvest distance details dot

836
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:15,839
and just realizing that type of attack
is may be hard but if you're targeting

837
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,239
someone specific

838
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:21,859
uh... that's that's entirely possible

839
00:42:21,859 --> 00:42:24,199
so well

840
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:25,919
we reverse engineer did

841
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,359
well

842
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:31,109
so we can doesn't do a software version
of of the car

843
00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:33,739
and some are already available online

844
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:35,829
uh... there's a link for more

845
00:42:35,829 --> 00:42:38,969
were for more in our paper reeve

846
00:42:38,969 --> 00:42:41,389
and uh...

847
00:42:41,389 --> 00:42:42,920
wires are useful as

848
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,409
e

849
00:42:46,409 --> 00:42:50,760
assault corporation of of of the crap
means that you can have a card reader

850
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,609
and have the card connected to it

851
00:42:53,609 --> 00:42:54,999
and

852
00:42:54,999 --> 00:43:00,549
and you'll be able to pull or get uh...
codes from afar you don't have to carry

853
00:43:00,549 --> 00:43:02,549
that that with you

854
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:05,499
or if you have multiple cartoon just
can't be bothered you want for

855
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:08,029
supporting and generate or went to court

856
00:43:08,029 --> 00:43:09,619
inductor install

857
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:12,999
but uh... the problem is that the clock
was meant

858
00:43:12,999 --> 00:43:14,839
uh... to be separate device too

859
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:19,599
new pc that could have nowhere on now
uh... software qa

860
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,960
can go back into the pc can be affected
by malware again

861
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,199
if you can go out and parker this

862
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:26,920
so

863
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,119
uh...

864
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:34,949
i think that uh... chip but there is a
has a very good example or verdict uh...

865
00:43:34,949 --> 00:43:36,469
uh...

866
00:43:36,469 --> 00:43:39,180
testcase for for to stay

867
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,460
for failures

868
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:43,789
of uh... of design certification
regulation

869
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:45,940
uh... and the incentive structure

870
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,279
of the entire system

871
00:43:47,279 --> 00:43:50,599
of widely deployed security system

872
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:52,479
so kind of ties into

873
00:43:52,479 --> 00:43:55,509
the move of this uh... workshop and

874
00:43:55,509 --> 00:43:56,809
also

875
00:43:56,809 --> 00:44:01,299
uh... many of the s wallace listen to
all the over talks that that we've had

876
00:44:01,299 --> 00:44:05,419
left couple occurs identified a lot of a
lot of similarities

877
00:44:05,419 --> 00:44:09,689
and and things that uh... that are
happening with japan

878
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,749
so we can we can draw quarter quarter
quarter quarter few interesting

879
00:44:12,749 --> 00:44:14,020
conclusions from it

880
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,479
but it really is sort of uh...

881
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:20,428
a large two point uh... security system
should uh...

882
00:44:20,429 --> 00:44:22,559
we should consider that

883
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:26,809
so uh... some of some of the insured
losses uh... the protocol uh...

884
00:44:26,809 --> 00:44:28,279
designers

885
00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:30,099
made unrealistic assumptions

886
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:32,549
of tampa resistance uh...

887
00:44:32,549 --> 00:44:37,809
their students at the interface between
the the card and the

888
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:39,919
macy's you will be protected

889
00:44:39,919 --> 00:44:41,839
that's cool policy

890
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,570
did that get information didn't really

891
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:46,359
uh... register

892
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:51,098
with person designed it and put a whole
and and and sister

893
00:44:51,099 --> 00:44:52,389
uh...

894
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:55,349
the specifications thousands of pages
long

895
00:44:55,349 --> 00:45:01,699
and uh... you can't communicate all the
things that uh... specified to all the

896
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:05,389
people or or involved in support of the
system into signing it

897
00:45:05,389 --> 00:45:07,639
or design will be the elements of it

898
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:09,359
so

899
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:10,679
uh...

900
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:14,789
so that's why we see some of these uh...
some of these issues

901
00:45:14,789 --> 00:45:15,989
also uh...

902
00:45:15,989 --> 00:45:19,150
managing the evolution of the system
like this

903
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,539
electric company

904
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:25,109
uh... should be should be uh... defined
from from the beginning

905
00:45:25,109 --> 00:45:27,949
we uh... we see um...

906
00:45:27,949 --> 00:45:30,910
time and again how one system is used

907
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:33,240
in ways that it was in it wasn't
designed

908
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,238
to be used

909
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:37,589
uh... as time goes on and we see this
with japan and

910
00:45:37,589 --> 00:45:42,979
we used to only enter pins etc at
a_t_m_s now we use we enter them pat

911
00:45:42,979 --> 00:45:45,339
tells and now we enter them with capt

912
00:45:45,339 --> 00:45:48,979
the the tokens or or overloaded and
that's uh... that's never a good for

913
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:50,118
security

914
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:55,129
uh... because no criminals have of more
ways of getting it and it's just a more

915
00:45:55,129 --> 00:45:56,730
uses of japan unlike

916
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:59,040
in the u_k_ to use it uh...

917
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,469
uh... for identity

918
00:46:02,469 --> 00:46:06,829
and uh... any is part of identity card
say

919
00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:10,259
it's uh...

920
00:46:10,259 --> 00:46:11,400
door in it

921
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,110
don't use a system that uh... that was
meant for one thing for for for for

922
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:18,059
other things things will break

923
00:46:18,059 --> 00:46:21,710
uh... as you patched things up the
entire banking systems is a huge

924
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:22,789
patchwork

925
00:46:22,789 --> 00:46:28,469
of things that were designed uh... uh...
fifty years ago uh... with mainframes

926
00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:32,579
and then for back which compared uh...
compatibility

927
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:33,659
uh...

928
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:35,679
of bunch of

929
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:38,779
of notarize

930
00:46:38,779 --> 00:46:44,789
uh... some of them or or or which is
uh... initialed today

931
00:46:44,789 --> 00:46:49,279
so another another thing to consider is
is uh...

932
00:46:49,279 --> 00:46:51,450
is basically is a system usable

933
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:54,239
uh... recent it just came out last week

934
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,369
the survey that eight million people in
in the u_k_

935
00:46:58,369 --> 00:47:00,269
gender use

936
00:47:00,269 --> 00:47:01,799
uh... which is a large number

937
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,190
uh... there's only sixteen eight sixty
million people in the u_k_

938
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,709
and uh...

939
00:47:06,709 --> 00:47:09,448
and people also people some people can't
remember the times which is quite

940
00:47:09,449 --> 00:47:11,049
reasonable

941
00:47:11,049 --> 00:47:13,839
uh...

942
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,350
do they really are due to blame for this
or

943
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:20,660
or do the both of the votes uh...
deported assistant that is is just and

944
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:21,740
reasonable yg

945
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:24,109
unreasonable to expect

946
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:27,720
to uh... to follow up the rules and the
rules are

947
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,738
he she never write down pin

948
00:47:29,739 --> 00:47:32,749
uh... using of students for

949
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:37,948
if you ever tell the the banks after
give uh... freud's been committed

950
00:47:37,949 --> 00:47:39,440
about your account

951
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,879
that you for a return to that you're
paying any kind of way

952
00:47:42,879 --> 00:47:44,669
even months also

953
00:47:44,669 --> 00:47:47,509
uh... as part of phone number

954
00:47:47,509 --> 00:47:49,509
they will not give your money back

955
00:47:49,509 --> 00:47:53,319
uh... or try not to give the money
that's because usually they will clear

956
00:47:53,319 --> 00:47:57,979
that you've of violated the terms and
conditions

957
00:47:57,979 --> 00:48:00,888
so uh... that's something to consider

958
00:48:00,889 --> 00:48:05,889
but mostly we have a problem of uh... of
poor uncertain self-destruction in the

959
00:48:05,889 --> 00:48:06,700
u_k_

960
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,310
where from

961
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:11,669
uh... anderson technician process

962
00:48:11,669 --> 00:48:14,440
where parents can can now

963
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,020
done to the liability

964
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:19,780
of uh... of fraud onto merchants and
cardholders

965
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:21,760
whereas before wasn't true had

966
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,209
protection by law

967
00:48:23,209 --> 00:48:26,538
so if i saw state signed uh... receipt

968
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:28,460
was actually protected by law

969
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:31,950
and now with japan enters the falconry

970
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,739
of code of practice

971
00:48:33,739 --> 00:48:36,299
that the banks to have to do so

972
00:48:36,299 --> 00:48:41,109
in order to uh... ended in elements it's
voluntary and a wrote it

973
00:48:41,109 --> 00:48:43,990
and when was it using the same documents
were

974
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:45,520
about carefully crusty

975
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:50,509
missing document including on the one
hand they claim to be protected of for

976
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:55,859
uh... against against crime characters
you only pay up to fifty pounds

977
00:48:55,859 --> 00:48:59,699
but in the other hand and said it was
all if you haven't been if you do you

978
00:48:59,699 --> 00:49:01,579
have been taking reasonable care

979
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:03,379
used a technical talk

980
00:49:03,379 --> 00:49:07,038
that they use so reasonable care can be
a uh...

981
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:09,229
interpreting in many ways

982
00:49:09,229 --> 00:49:12,439
and with n dot a pleasant surprise thank
you

983
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,960
wasn't canceled that uh... you fa you
haven't uh... taken reasonable care by

984
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,259
patching up and you're computer and
using the latest antivirus

985
00:49:21,259 --> 00:49:28,259
he will get your money back if you don't
want uh... infuse you component

986
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,799
and with the payment for the vice is
uh... the back set the standards for for

987
00:49:32,799 --> 00:49:33,989
the security

988
00:49:33,989 --> 00:49:37,929
the cure became they're cute they're
cute is protected but was so that

989
00:49:37,929 --> 00:49:40,890
ricardo uh... card but it doesn't

990
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:42,078
and customers have

991
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,239
approval little to say about the
security systems that they use for

992
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,449
online

993
00:49:47,449 --> 00:49:51,749
and in the and shots

994
00:49:51,749 --> 00:49:53,069
uh...

995
00:49:53,069 --> 00:49:57,808
sold at there's no competition back
still compute armed security

996
00:49:57,809 --> 00:50:00,559
uh... and in general create the

997
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:05,369
present comment front

998
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,109
i'm gonna i'm gonna skip

999
00:50:07,109 --> 00:50:08,328
skip that well

1000
00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:10,130
uh... again the last week

1001
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:14,679
uh... survey from uh... the circus who
watched uh... organization which

1002
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:18,859
came out and said that uh... uh... with
the services that one-in-five card

1003
00:50:18,859 --> 00:50:22,389
holders do not get their money back
after for which is square quit work

1004
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:23,879
number

1005
00:50:23,879 --> 00:50:27,250
uh... there are others who is uh...
wandered into uh...

1006
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,549
well i'll briefly mention

1007
00:50:29,549 --> 00:50:32,969
using more stressing the point too much
but uh... the banks are reluctant to

1008
00:50:32,969 --> 00:50:34,289
provide victims

1009
00:50:34,289 --> 00:50:36,230
the evidence that they use

1010
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:39,459
in order to do determined that they've
been uh...

1011
00:50:39,459 --> 00:50:41,328
uh... fraudulent

1012
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:44,879
uh... for instance one of the route one
of their uh... rules is that you need to

1013
00:50:44,879 --> 00:50:46,919
destroyed card after fraught

1014
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:51,319
and to me that that seems uh... almost
exactly like crew making a body after

1015
00:50:51,319 --> 00:50:53,329
murder before an autopsy

1016
00:50:53,329 --> 00:50:54,829
uh...

1017
00:50:54,829 --> 00:50:57,740
and uh... so that that that this
procedure

1018
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,448
again and and lucy in the uh...

1019
00:51:00,449 --> 00:51:04,089
corals are not being are tall not book

1020
00:51:04,089 --> 00:51:06,729
regulation you have to go to the banks
first

1021
00:51:06,729 --> 00:51:08,879
before you go to bed to complain

1022
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,119
banks decided

1023
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:12,179
which of what to do with you

1024
00:51:12,179 --> 00:51:14,279
or would you please

1025
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:15,399
skip this thing

1026
00:51:15,399 --> 00:51:18,270
and uh... this is the wait for it

1027
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:19,538
uh...

1028
00:51:19,539 --> 00:51:21,770
some things that i mentioned the olympic
team

1029
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:24,229
teaching such transactions education

1030
00:51:24,229 --> 00:51:28,808
uh... population where a lot of things
that

1031
00:51:28,809 --> 00:51:32,719
uh... it will require higher bandwidth
or connected devices

1032
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:36,319
and more input from from uh... from the
user

1033
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,788
uh... they are devices they're going to
do this uh... attempted to put in

1034
00:51:39,789 --> 00:51:43,449
germany

1035
00:51:43,449 --> 00:51:48,360
uh... for counterfeit cards use pinprick
should be dynamic data indication

1036
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,579
my cv looks ah...

1037
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:54,389
that's something that was proposing two
thousand two by mastercard

1038
00:51:54,389 --> 00:51:59,909
to not have the same three digit number
again is on the uh... mag stripe

1039
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:01,910
the same as the ones in store

1040
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,269
on the card

1041
00:52:03,269 --> 00:52:06,328
uh... and that that supposedly split

1042
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:11,449
is icy views and partition in the u_k_
from two thousand inmates brent

1043
00:52:11,449 --> 00:52:13,959
witness to the few early two thousand
men

1044
00:52:13,959 --> 00:52:15,339
and uh...

1045
00:52:15,339 --> 00:52:17,160
we saw that issue wasn't

1046
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:22,109
wasn't absolutely hope it's uh... it's
there now and we've heard that uh...

1047
00:52:22,109 --> 00:52:25,519
encryption is being destroyed to be
deported because the

1048
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:28,928
uh... the prices of these cards have
gone to hell

1049
00:52:28,929 --> 00:52:30,210
uh... would like

1050
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:34,420
i'd like to see us some some months more
protection by law

1051
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:39,160
electing the lead in the u_s_ listbox
can't prove within few days that uh...

1052
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,689
you've been negligent you get your money
back

1053
00:52:42,689 --> 00:52:46,408
whereas knowing that you could stressed
with the

1054
00:52:46,409 --> 00:52:49,769
dishes are more effective coastal
protection agencies like the promotional

1055
00:52:49,769 --> 00:52:50,698
blitz man

1056
00:52:50,699 --> 00:52:54,189
was lobbed and protecting customers

1057
00:52:54,189 --> 00:52:55,868
uh... design process

1058
00:52:55,869 --> 00:53:00,599
probably uh... did for for many other
systems have a clear communication of

1059
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:02,889
security calls in a concise way

1060
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:04,780
systems all the people that are

1061
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:09,829
uh... involving designed no what you're
supposed to be doing

1062
00:53:09,829 --> 00:53:10,900
an

1063
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:13,279
instantaneous certification area

1064
00:53:13,279 --> 00:53:16,850
uh... reliability structure to protect
security failures

1065
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:21,419
where uh...

1066
00:53:21,419 --> 00:53:24,240
hired the certification body that will

1067
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:24,868
uh...

1068
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:27,219
uh... approve your uror

1069
00:53:27,219 --> 00:53:28,669
uh...

1070
00:53:28,669 --> 00:53:32,558
your product around and wonderful for
security issues in it

1071
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,619
uh... so sposato evaluation

1072
00:53:35,619 --> 00:53:39,899
you can also provide forces for exports
that would but

1073
00:53:39,899 --> 00:53:42,969
the authorities that certified
devaluation laps

1074
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:46,480
so the these are outlined and at the end
of work

1075
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,169
interpret

1076
00:53:49,169 --> 00:53:50,509
so this is the

1077
00:53:50,509 --> 00:53:51,789
one of the talk

1078
00:53:51,789 --> 00:53:54,029
uh...

1079
00:53:54,029 --> 00:53:56,050
uh... confined to the

1080
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:59,089
a lot of our work on uh... on the blog
or groups blogs

1081
00:53:59,089 --> 00:54:00,499
and

1082
00:54:00,499 --> 00:54:05,669
uh... or everything i talked about as
here and and this link including videos

an eminent persons in different
countries

1090
00:54:25,879 --> 00:54:31,139
and you mentioned something about some
people using its record weirdness uh...

1091
00:54:31,139 --> 00:54:32,209
you know what

1092
00:54:32,209 --> 00:54:36,469
holly leading edge of the country's and
without the computer doing other things

1093
00:54:36,469 --> 00:54:38,089
you know what they're doing here

1094
00:54:38,089 --> 00:54:39,000
notebook

1095
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,439
um...

1096
00:54:41,439 --> 00:54:45,328
they're sexually to too

1097
00:54:45,329 --> 00:54:50,769
to encryption mechanism to groups and
winston pretty or to create uh... no max

1098
00:54:50,769 --> 00:54:51,799
and

1099
00:54:51,799 --> 00:54:55,989
well there is a state uh... static data
indication that uh... does only

1100
00:54:55,989 --> 00:54:57,499
signature comfy

1101
00:54:57,499 --> 00:55:00,269
induction that's used for generating met

1102
00:55:00,269 --> 00:55:03,019
but it can't include becomes the
terminal

1103
00:55:03,019 --> 00:55:06,968
the pincher device in the parking lot
chippy

1104
00:55:06,969 --> 00:55:10,040
and then there is uh... ticket dynamic
data for the commission

1105
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,509
depart is capable of doing arce

1106
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:14,429
uh... this mature comfy

1107
00:55:14,429 --> 00:55:19,449
and there's you'd think he has been sent
to the time and then we can encrypt

1108
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:22,499
uh...

1109
00:55:22,499 --> 00:55:23,549
between them

1110
00:55:23,549 --> 00:55:25,069
and

1111
00:55:25,069 --> 00:55:29,209
i do not know well with that type of
course of their uh... countries are

1112
00:55:29,209 --> 00:55:32,279
initially but women should have been
came out

1113
00:55:32,279 --> 00:55:34,019
the

1114
00:55:34,019 --> 00:55:41,019
the cost of the in you'd you'd pardon
the signature perfectly card

1115
00:55:41,319 --> 00:55:42,279
was double

1116
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:47,169
and the symmetrical and it's about two
dollars to one dollar

1117
00:55:47,169 --> 00:55:49,609
students had to go with that

1118
00:55:49,609 --> 00:55:51,169
uh...

1119
00:55:51,169 --> 00:55:56,179
about the same price instead souls can

uh... or since

1125
00:56:15,099 --> 00:56:17,769
i think all of them are capable of doing

if you're

00:56:24,219 --> 00:56:29,109
it depends on how the uh... and some of
the options and how it's implemented

00:56:29,109 --> 00:56:31,319
you may be able to sometimes four

and then have it uh... and then captured
the pain

1136
00:56:43,959 --> 00:56:45,279
cancel the transaction

1137
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,969
and and and connected

1138
00:56:49,969 --> 00:56:53,629
so because he eats visa transaction will
fail

1139
00:56:53,629 --> 00:56:55,389
if you can't

1140
00:56:55,389 --> 00:56:57,479
and then uh...

1141
00:56:57,479 --> 00:56:58,948
uh...

1142
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:04,329
but then than you can just uh... do
another one

1143
00:57:04,329 --> 00:57:11,329
and and and i will go through and got
you've got to do that you want

1144
00:57:11,509 --> 00:57:15,179
the layout tax there would be really no
way of protecting herself with them and

1145
00:57:15,179 --> 00:57:15,940
there will be

1146
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:21,720
their wireless terminal say there will
be delayed it's unisa as a card holders

1147
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,839
there's no way

1148
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,009
uh...

1149
00:57:25,009 --> 00:57:26,259
at and

1150
00:57:26,259 --> 00:57:29,749
remember that the religion into secret
but the really attractive circuit it can

1151
00:57:29,749 --> 00:57:31,939
work on any type of card

1152
00:57:31,939 --> 00:57:35,578
the even if there is uh... encryption or
thing

1153
00:57:35,579 --> 00:57:36,720
uh... in it

1154
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,509
you don't need to understand people
reports of in order to risk it to

1155
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:42,290
rewrite that that's the beauty of it

1156
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:45,549
and some simple

1157
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:47,639
uh... you know that

1158
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:51,189
is very little in fact the department
can do that

1159
00:57:51,189 --> 00:57:53,459
uh...

1160
00:57:53,459 --> 00:57:57,969
check the checked checked your uh...
statements regularly to see if he is

1161
00:57:57,969 --> 00:58:02,009
uh... if there's there's been authorized
transactions and there

1162
00:58:02,009 --> 00:58:05,279
accounting defied the banks immediately

1163
00:58:05,279 --> 00:58:08,059
they're back

1164
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:08,809
uh...

less protection in internal review

1178
00:58:48,629 --> 00:58:51,578

1179
00:58:51,579 --> 00:58:53,259
uh...

1180
00:58:53,259 --> 00:58:57,070
uh... reread lol

1181
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:59,809
uh... as you were with uh... with the
signature

1182
00:58:59,809 --> 00:59:01,159
but uh...

1183
00:59:01,159 --> 00:59:05,229
remember it when the dip deployed that
japan inhale in the u_k_

1184
00:59:05,229 --> 00:59:07,779
the captain extra combat

1185
00:59:07,779 --> 00:59:09,490
city still do the same

1186
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:13,549
same uh... scanning attacks as you've as
you could before there's nothing to

1187
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:14,809
prevent that

1188
00:59:14,809 --> 00:59:17,519
uh... the reasons why we do that is
because they

1189
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:20,859
didn't want to um... you to prevent u

1190
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:22,009
from uh...

1191
00:59:22,009 --> 00:59:23,679
from using the card abroad

1192
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:25,030
but uh... i would've

1193
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:29,870
refer to get a cart that continues in

00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:48,519
and uh...

1200
00:59:48,519 --> 00:59:52,240
that stepped out of step because people
didn't stir

1201

but i do know that uh...

1226
01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:29,419
well sometimes debate will go to great
lengths to place

1227
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:31,799
uh... fraud cases

use it for

1232
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:40,380
escape getting money out of the account

1233
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:43,179
and then saying i've been defrauded and
what the money back

1234
01:01:43,179 --> 01:01:45,119
this is what they're trying to fight

1235
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,999
uh... but they'll spend a lot of money

1236
01:01:46,999 --> 01:01:48,609
for uh...

1237
01:01:48,609 --> 01:01:53,229
of lawyers in order to fight these cases
where somebody's asking for five hunt

1238
01:01:53,229 --> 01:01:54,229
comes back

1239
01:01:54,229 --> 01:01:56,939
and those i don't know how hard money

1240
01:01:56,939 --> 01:01:58,919
just was

1241
01:01:58,919 --> 01:02:02,439
it doesn't make sense to us women main
makes sense to them because they don't

1242
01:02:02,439 --> 01:02:05,439
want to play the processing

1243
01:02:05,439 --> 01:02:06,558
that will erode

1244
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:07,859
the uh...

1245
01:02:07,859 --> 01:02:09,619
uh...

1246
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:16,619
uh... reinstituted security can

1247
01:02:17,339 --> 01:02:20,038
uh... question about mike struck again

1248
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:22,559
he said because the didn't have much
count on them

1249
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,999
so they can be used for for you know
agent broadway

1250
01:02:26,999 --> 01:02:27,968
would be chip

1251
01:02:27,969 --> 01:02:31,699
in those called still have to talk to
date on it

1252
01:02:31,699 --> 01:02:34,660
so based believe those are just as
vulnerable to

1253
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:37,578
weed

1254
01:02:37,579 --> 01:02:41,399
yes uh... this is what i was talking
about with the cdv

1255
01:02:41,399 --> 01:02:46,388
which uh... simplistic wants to be the
three it's uh...

1256
01:02:46,389 --> 01:02:48,039
stewardship and came out

1257
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:49,139
g

1258
01:02:49,139 --> 01:02:51,619
it was exactly the same data on the trip

1259
01:02:51,619 --> 01:02:53,329
and then the next right

1260
01:02:53,329 --> 01:02:57,849
but no or the new cards are supposed to
have defense industry digits

1261
01:02:57,849 --> 01:03:01,779
such that if you do the attacker the
financially devices that uh... described

1262
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:04,430
uh... you won't get the correct they
don't know whether

1263
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:08,549
whether that three three digits are
being verified and we came in thailand i

1264
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:11,159
don't know

1265
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:18,159
if if it if it goes all the way back to
to be issuing bank in order to verify

1266
01:03:19,209 --> 01:03:21,519
then the question the book about

1267
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:27,069
uh... in offline transactions take it
couldn't be there right exactly right

1268
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:29,159
reported in motions but

1269
01:03:29,159 --> 01:03:32,099
they worked was called a really escorts

1270
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:32,999
uh...

1271
01:03:32,999 --> 01:03:35,709
where considered the certificate

1272
01:03:35,709 --> 01:03:37,230
user district

1273
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:41,379
the did there is a certificate of the
people into devices they're fine

1274
01:03:41,379 --> 01:03:42,750
and

1275
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:45,319
uh... it could be read replaced

1276
01:03:45,319 --> 01:03:46,038
exit

1277
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:49,779
the program and the card when we see
that it was correct

1278
01:03:49,779 --> 01:03:53,529
and provide america's incorrect which is
is enough for transaction

1279
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:56,850
uh... to there's no way for the for the
merchant

1280
01:03:56,850 --> 01:03:58,339
to their site

1281
01:03:58,339 --> 01:04:02,029
that uh... it's correct because he
doesn't have the key the key is with the

1282
01:04:02,029 --> 01:04:05,299
banks and they only do it once a day
where they sent all the max for

1283
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:06,569
verification

1284
01:04:06,569 --> 01:04:11,270
to be a or intersections and and care
running your career so that uh... about

1285
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:12,220
ten percent of

1286
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:14,109
uh... transactions are

1287
01:04:14,109 --> 01:04:15,859
uh... off line in the u_k_

1288
01:04:15,859 --> 01:04:18,049
eucalyptus at sometimes uh...

1289
01:04:18,049 --> 01:04:20,969
how professed transaction happened

1290
01:04:20,969 --> 01:04:25,209
you you can tell consider markets for
assistance to the record

1291
01:04:25,209 --> 01:04:27,808
and sometimes it takes a couple of
seconds

1292
01:04:27,809 --> 01:04:29,349
it

1293
01:04:29,349 --> 01:04:32,089
there's very few

1294
01:04:32,089 --> 01:04:36,220
and olivier's with a communications
we've

1295
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:40,269
you would get for back to the point part

because before

1330

election the

1339
01:07:01,609 --> 01:07:03,109
of into that

1340
01:07:03,109 --> 01:07:06,649
uh...

1341
01:07:06,649 --> 01:07:11,989

01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:24,029
three digits from password and use that
and signed onto

1347
01:07:24,029 --> 01:07:28,029
uh... one of the problems with that is
that you need to greet
