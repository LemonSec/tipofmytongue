1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,149
but think where

2
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:03,740
right on time actually

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,750
is one o'clock

4
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,259
uh... just a couple of small things we
have t-shirts

5
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:13,689
to one of my t-shirt you're gonna have
to pay online to get you t-shirt because

6
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:17,198
we don't have any cash handling here so
uh...

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,400
to government site

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,659
there is coming from there to pay pal
booking

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,739
to pay i think it's twenty years

10
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:27,109
twenty years pretty sure it if you want
to there in the small rooms so you can

11
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:31,049
go and look at them and you know check
the quality much includes merchandise

12
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:31,919
for you but

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,889
uh...

14
00:00:32,889 --> 00:00:36,200
right next do you know the next speech
is

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,280
them again

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,100
i think it's open up

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,510
so i want to any introductions this year
because i was really crap but it last

18
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,790
year so to say old this is trusted speed
and he's going to talk about hard

19
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,660
working and enjoyed

20
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,339
organic

21
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,140
of it

22
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,930
so it will be talking about these things
today

23
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,550
uh... this particular model came from
uh... for the months of india

24
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,850
complete computer with the radio they
can run for europe batteries and its

25
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,910
network by eighty six

26
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,350
uh... the manufacturing cost for this is
proud of us you can buy them in small

27
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,890
quantities levels for europe

28
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,840
and if you were to manufacture your own
large quantities might be able to get

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,990
close by

30
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,449
in each of these devices you've got

31
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,970
uh... that ship which acts as a
low-power radio and you might also have

32
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,890
a separate microcontroller

33
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,679
or in the case in this particular model
that combined

34
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:41,840
into single-chip the trip on twenty four
thirty

35
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,650
b

36
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,220
question comes up the money power

37
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,550
thousand be scouted out field

38
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,450
doing something

39
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,049
and that something might be managing
land mines support might be damaging

40
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,560
electric meters

41
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,730
or maybe just wonder what the
temperature is every spot brown

42
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:02,180
uh... weakening of the played like that
they are open to an attacker though

43
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,470
over the network answers

44
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,920
so in addition to anything

45
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,729
but you know my particular radio do
through i could be six

46
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,829
i'm also able to steal one of these
units

47
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:16,580
and it's very difficult to automate

48
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,290
infecting whether unit has been stolen
or whether it just diet

49
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,948
battery box or old-age things like that

50
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:30,509
because these adult with cheap
components they're meant to be disposed

51
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:33,759
so alone spent the first half of this
lecture

52
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,738
explaining how u

53
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:36,590
steel

54
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,649
kitchens

55
00:02:38,649 --> 00:02:41,809
using the fact that i came up with uh...
first xanadu

56
00:02:41,809 --> 00:02:44,889
blackout dates

57
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:49,489
and also be talking a little bit about
this device which is the at that point

58
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:52,219
user two boards have gotten for are

59
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:57,049
this is uh... gatech adapter it also
allows debugging chips

60
00:02:57,049 --> 00:02:58,649
uh... weird products

61
00:02:58,649 --> 00:02:59,670
cio's

62
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,649
if you want to be but the chick on
twenty four thirty you have to buy

63
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,149
either

64
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:07,969
uh... an adapter for my friends looking
out for you have to buy an adapter texas

65
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:09,019
instruments

66
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:10,559
manufacturer

67
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:13,919
or hurt you can build a certain size
project

68
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,769
uh... painful market whatsoever

69
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:21,519
and you can you buy that buchanan start
talking to him

70
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,799
set bytes of memory nearby to your
bracelet and then you can find mistakes

71
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,109
in debugging purple

72
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,529
chile

73
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:33,160
edit it should be obvious to anyone
who's look at this

74
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,719
sort of technology diplomatic act forty
seven

75
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,039
the for part b dot dot thank you dot

76
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,108
does to repair a broken

77
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:47,319
you have a home router and for limits on
it failed firmware upgrade

78
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,629
you can use the tape and after which

79
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:50,450
michael

80
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,279
for uh... pc carol

81
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:54,439
teary flashing

82
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:59,439
and find many trips there are defense
mechanisms against this soviet walk out

83
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,180
of work

84
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,289
or chip rather

85
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:02,988
and protected from being

86
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:04,649
access to that

87
00:04:04,649 --> 00:04:09,009
in the case this morning uses the
amnesty for thirty f_-sixteen well

88
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:12,398
if you want to talk like a tactic
concert just up here

89
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:16,499
and interviews inside blow to keep
background

90
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:18,849
or are psyched for it

91
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:22,938
will g of japan time about

92
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:26,819
adversities get

93
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:29,319
you can also skip instructions a bit

94
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:31,580
so while many of you are

95
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,568
familiar with how to write software that
secure

96
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:35,760
global

97
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,800
uh... you're saying that every structure
will be executed correct

98
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,090
uh... how certainly the bright our
program of security attacker

99
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:50,330
has a one percent chance of skipping any
given instruction

100
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,789
content of this lecture

101
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:55,719
we talk about wireless sensing networks
of wireless internet work is a

102
00:04:55,719 --> 00:04:59,139
collection of the by such a good person

103
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,270
outs composed of just like these

104
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,440
um... japan twenty four thirty

105
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,680
to distance from the bottle

106
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,269
it's an area fifty one microcontroller
combined with the radio

107
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:13,520
you write for my written intelligent
watching language

108
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,349
lou dot garrett has registers for
sending packets registers for teasing

109
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,729
the frequency

110
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:21,519
broadcaster section

111
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,860
registers for power management c making
shutdown sleep for awhile

112
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,160
and there's also a registry which holds
a day's work for me

113
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,590
for herbert select the proper

114
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,399
this is necessary because the if it
wants to slow bike

115
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,409
it doesn't have the howard implemented

116
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:41,560
photography even symmetric republican
software

117
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,559
so instead that's delegated the park

118
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:48,079
resolves it means that it's very
difficult to use anything bias for

119
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,399
minister

120
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,680
and it means that it's very difficult to
use

121
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,110
anything about this implementation

122
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,389
of a s one twenty aperture

123
00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:58,570
uh... bitch about

124
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,050
twenty four thirty one is actually the
same chet

125
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,860
with preloaded software

126
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,319
so if you want to built one of these
devices you don't want to spend the time

127
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,919
to write your own firmware

128
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:10,280
you buy it shipped

129
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,559
which has all of that treatment inside
and out of your board

130
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,419
and any connection to the

131
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:17,909
this to be akin to

132
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:21,199
find uh... about important pre-installed

133
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,570
bar actually knowing

134
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,930
what's running off

135
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,440
so different why did this hasn't been
audited outside of

136
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,499
manufacture

137
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:35,380
if there are problems with that we don't
yet know

138
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:40,119
and their party of two fifty years
appear at the top left its

139
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:42,590
relevant because user

140
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,808
that's it the strip extolled problems
with the previous generation

141
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:49,629
this assumption that have no basis

142
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:53,410
uh... at published an attack on the two
point twenty four twenty

143
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:58,350
and i got all of these nasty comments
replies no doubt be like a pretty secure

144
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,669
because the electric meters he's the
into fifty instead

145
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:06,460
as you'll see later its actual lisa cure
please chips worth uh...

146
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,279
first

147
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:11,699
very clearly by now

148
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,010
when i notified them of this problem he
replied our

149
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,360
and they did

150
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,620
tries to downplayed or

151
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,580
spin it anyway

152
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,068
certain through their first generation
ships

153
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:31,490
spending disgruntled were on t_v_ and
berkeley for on at this point the two

154
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,009
companies library that building sector

155
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:38,749
uh... soon whether it be prefixes cc or
yeah

156
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,389
it's the same dot

157
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:42,510
the numbered

158
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,210
twenty four twenty eight million
manufactured like more difficult and

159
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,959
expensive that part

160
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:53,400
wilder took on twenty four twenty so
many factions ball

161
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,489
in the second generation ships

162
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:58,888
the out of my control radio bro

163
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:01,759
first iteration two separate should
support out

164
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,710
situa com twenty four twenty eight and
you would have picked for an a_t_r_ or

165
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,888
domestic partners microcontroller

166
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:14,889
the code would run inside my controller
brady would only be used rogues

167
00:08:16,809 --> 00:08:20,270
this free

168
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:26,909
an

169
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:29,370
adding yet broken the upcoming third
generation

170
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,729
but they will be

171
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:32,870
as soon as i get

172
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,179
samples but

173
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:38,400
and got on the second half of this
electoral talk about wireless sensors

174
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,269
general

175
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:44,720
and things that you can do it the board
level run chapel

176
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,230
and a lot of postcards to the fact that
in embedded systems

177
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,510
no one has to

178
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,189
worry about security and some of the big
ninety

179
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,220
silly eternity we have people whose

180
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,070
jobs

181
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,730
judges too

182
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,190
sit make sure that the servers on track

183
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,119
and get the servers broken into motyar
server it on your server room

184
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:10,590
your customers are connecting to it hits
the big hassle your business

185
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,270
in chip many factions very different
because

186
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:18,180
if the company sells to chip new release
of product with the problem about

187
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,310
product

188
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,609
it never goes back to them directly

189
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,320
in the case um...

190
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,490
for our security

191
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,720
it should be able to keep an attacker
from reading it software

192
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,930
if it's broken

193
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,250
it's very rare that i will know how or
where

194
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,350
it's not as if they're connected to you
it's not as if you have

195
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,400
loss that you can keep the manufactured
knows

196
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,569
everything that happens product after
shifts

197
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:51,030
so the the sorts of problems that are
found bar

198
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,530
trivial and a

199
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,069
happy birthday wrapped up

200
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,350
indicates it

201
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,660
comes up in the first half

202
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,180
their partner issues with these trips

203
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,079
in order to repair the mir after
released new

204
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,250
hardware revisions abhijit

205
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,490
yet the ship has been ships to pass
through perhaps re fabricate

206
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,700
every board games

207
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,190
in practice this means that it will not
be patched

208
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,000
i recall cannot be a port

209
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,959
mines in tuzla negatively

210
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,758
it's it's impossible so

211
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,670
this problem will remain address these
problems are properly

212
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:31,510
than ever fixed

213
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:35,130
printers and uh... meeting once the guy
who's sitting at the board going through

214
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,580
this is the trailer

215
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,230
and uh...

216
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,160
all the kept writing

217
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,249
that's uh... the

218
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:45,450
c_i_a_ aca ecstatic

219
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,250
i got bored and i started to blame

220
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,230
sometimes meetings that

221
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,240
then i realized that

222
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,110
of this

223
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,900
but it's not suggest me are trying to
bill the security models

224
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,350
the overhang think they're trying to
keep confidential

225
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,270
use the software inside

226
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,460
useful i_d_

227
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,970
give you a check

228
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,230
as the manufacturer iron only
responsible for making sure that your

229
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,000
competitor not well durable

230
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,120
or at least detected reads

231
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,750
in order to be that architect flash
flood

232
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,300
i don't protect rap

233
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,949
because

234
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:28,130
there is nothing in there and your
competitor houston helpful product

235
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:34,520
that's the the source of a lot of stuff

236
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,790
as far as the

237
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,319
protections for these things and uh...

238
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,480
electric power meter

239
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,160
uses to be technology and

240
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,490
the state of florida

241
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,700
breaking into this matter

242
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,369
sir

243
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:50,410
one hundred and fifty dollar fine

244
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,939
plus the cost of repair replacement
investigation

c_b_s_ confess the crime in city hall
immediately

00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,080
stuff

248
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,410
this is the only

249
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:06,300
sort of tampa resistance that could be a
port

250
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:13,300
or

251
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:24,070
name

252
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,790
uh...

253
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:41,589
e while

254
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:47,760
kid different

255
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,430
issue

256
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:59,430
uh...

257
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:10,539
e also communicate with each other in
order to you for doing data back to you

258
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:15,880
you'd like to keep wanting to get
pricing information from the left

259
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,840
which means that they have to very
complicated tighter that working

260
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,630
implemented on sogobiz

261
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:28,430
odds of them getting that right on both
ends are

262
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,719
they bumped up right

263
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,220
there also limited

264
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,130
in their protocols by he

265
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,370
propose supported by chips

266
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,240
they can use any type of privately other
than any of the company's chips are only

267
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,600
shipping with a yes

00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,540
would

271
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,309
i'm

272
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:05,020
uh...

273
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,079
al have

00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,840
the rights to impersonate the birth

argument pop

276
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,689
and i can do it without ever touching
meter tripping its

277
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,790
dot that's that

278
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,939
out as far as the albertson fifty which
is best popular radio with in

279
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:23,339
electric starter

280
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,550
at least united states voucher about
europe

281
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,469
there it is no protection

282
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,630
for that matter

283
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,860
indicates the japan twenty four thirty
eight twenty five thirty and every other

284
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,240
chipping richard mike or or

285
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,379
the cheese are usually extracted because
the

286
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:43,530
compiler moves

287
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,060
all data

288
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:49,270
from flash memory into rampant star

289
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,350
it's in a two fifty one chip which is
hard work

290
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,240
so you have to memories in stone while

291
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,180
instruction memory and you have been
about

292
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,229
instruction memory

293
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,370
pattaya

294
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,760
be ready to leave statement uh...

295
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,330
to pop up keep reading

296
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:09,910
but more importantly desi programming
language demands that all corners be

297
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,360
compatible with one another

298
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,030
and if you have to memories yet to
instructions for fetching value about a

299
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,990
quarter

300
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,550
decompiler have to do which instruction
use

301
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,180
the way it does this is just

302
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,729
copied everything to emery

303
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,690
and that that is that bharathi

304
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,170
and all up in a member of the strippers
and ram

305
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,800
altogether

306
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:39,560
justification or used about since the
network

307
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,959
connect with the debugger

308
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,910
order to erase all of its memory which
is the only thing that you're about to

309
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,790
do

310
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,740
before

311
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,740
but it was even walked out that up

312
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,400
and then once it's a raised all memory

313
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,360
main that

314
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,020
every single bit class for her as a
while

315
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,770
data memories i'm rocky read anything in
life

316
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:08,770
and it's just about everything that that

317
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,100
i'll talk a lot about the friendships

318
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,810
every vendor is planning to have a new
chip coming out soon looks better

319
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:17,998
uh... and i

320
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:21,460
do a lot of examples of the list before
thirty because of dollywood

321
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,670
and i'd like to chat about saying

322
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,199
than any one of these chips use worse
than its competitors

323
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,040
except as a directly comparing

324
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,949
amber and strip bar

325
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,940
devotes apartments about don't assume

326
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,580
that another competitive used is secure

327
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,980
just because it demonstrated these trips

328
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,110
to briefly

329
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,019
very briefly review the sports

330
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:48,580
orix about like that

331
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,830
department

332
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,110
uh... but microcontroller is computer

333
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,100
it'll be a hta sixteen-bit computer with
no

334
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,510
user bad also or

335
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,850
so you just have a single application
running

336
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,010
you have no function tables or

337
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,210
api writing and

338
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,299
the things you would expect the pc exito

339
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:09,709
how approval

340
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:12,840
not happen in that meeting if you can't
afford it

341
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,599
therefore you have no reason to have
huntington's

342
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,699
everything stepford wife

343
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,920
every

344
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,580
routinely would normally be held within
the operating system pro

345
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,918
is instead just a thought

346
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,490
and often even inline

347
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,370
too

348
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:34,320
whereas normally would expect the cold
when i a port to took something

349
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,200
uh... driven interrupt handler pro

350
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,530
about hero on where on this trip

351
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:45,490
all you do is write volume to be part of
uh...

352
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,220
doing it right too

353
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,350
today uh... report one output

354
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,199
right by into memory

355
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,809
uh... zero acts zero zero seven five

uh...

362
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,669
while sexism

363
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:31,360
senses themselves artist radio

364
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,129
plug-in or microcontroller

365
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,860
perhaps with some

366
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,840
sensing equipment on the side

367
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,510
this is one from the swiss alps

368
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,350
the

369
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,908
such a connector here

370
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:47,210
which runs into

371
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,150
uh... the temperature sensor its drill
into the eyes

372
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,039
and then that you have uh...

373
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,929
a computer at a radio here this board
itself

374
00:18:55,929 --> 00:18:57,909
insisting on my website

375
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:01,160
that connects to the rest of it believed
sensing interface

376
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,370
the battery

377
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,399
and uh...

378
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,560
secure digital card adapter or log

379
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,980
and earn

380
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:16,350
a couple of different terms there might
be easier for us to the upper layers

381
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:20,159
uh... i'll use the term abandon
precisely so uh...

382
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,260
when i say zigbee i mean

383
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,330
uh... the high in butter levels

384
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,899
of zigbee

385
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,120
standard is a competitors like maybe six

386
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,929
in this domain

387
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,910
and also indeed

388
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,120
the lower lip sync attitude i think that
poor

389
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,500
wheaties the standard fights break chip
itself

390
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,320
backer all part of it

391
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,340
apparently all all

392
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:52,189
when i say personalized radio need
region use just radio

393
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,300
attitudes second-generation on subregion

394
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:00,260
that also back-to-back

395
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,830
prior to due to chips that the same

396
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:08,470
and they were just a radio you could
send a key over a syria

397
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:12,900
f_b_i_ possessing principle

398
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,970
centres their technique and pass it

399
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:19,710
epic and stick to syringes into border

400
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,150
and you can watch

401
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,280
the microcontrollers send

402
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,580
the s one twenty eighty two

403
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,699
the radio

404
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,820
and at this point zero being advertised
we have security we have a s one twenty

405
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,899
eight point when he has not broken yet

406
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,860
you don't have to worry about anything

407
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,789
but the fact was that if he stuck his
arranges

408
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:40,020
into a single unit

409
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,580
and stepping in in a way that actually

410
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,949
can't be detected electrically gypsies

411
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,120
we don't talk about

412
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,080
you could get

413
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,629
all of the case that you need me

414
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,279
and networking protocols assignment all

415
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:55,820
share the same snuggling

416
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,030
are you allowed to

417
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:05,030
uh... impersonate device that you stuck
needles and because the president nelson

418
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,190
all you have to do is take

419
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,559
needles and uh... test points border
test points are unavailable

420
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:14,879
used twenty detectives ranges to sharpen
up

421
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,630
to dig into that little almost solder

422
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,300
on the chip itself

423
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,909
and hang on when there is that

424
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,430
the defender doesn't really have the
option of not participants

425
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,640
sometimes tripods

426
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,409
when you do this to you see on your
souls go

427
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:36,929
the actual traffic across so

428
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:38,790
here we have to buy exp sat

429
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,420
and this is on the bar

430
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:47,310
the data is written by each party of the
rising at an example is on the part

431
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,600
this is traffic house

432
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,610
believe this is one bite expands and ben
uh...

433
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,879
that

434
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,370
uh... see just over eleven to one
another

435
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,800
and then you can

436
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,340
watch all trapped

437
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,939
you can purchase a device virtually from
people opens

438
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,120
uh... this is a screenshot plant their
beagle

439
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,939
the ill-considered as quickly as these
chips could speak to one another to have

440
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,070
to worry about losing

441
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,350
facts that

442
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,480
and you can see

443
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,120
this hexadecimal traffic is everything
that's been set between them

444
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,790
to five used the back there i'm only
seen one part of

445
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,960
conversation

446
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,020
is evolving stuck his head

447
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,990
so i see everything that the host sends
to radio

448
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,800
nancy box

449
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,200
that would take his actors

450
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,670
mystic dream according to the impacts
you need to pick we need to be

451
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:50,450
we think he can begin instead

452
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,179
based

453
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:56,419
article it publishes a put the blogs hey
here's the thing you stick needles in

454
00:22:56,419 --> 00:22:58,090
here at that's why it is

455
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,740
citizens here

456
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,440
i didn't mention the application

457
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,740
and sports margaret or anything like
that but this was at the same time that

458
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,159
c_n_n_ ran a story on thus far

459
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,710
and that you got confused in the late
perhaps

460
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:15,140
you're writing an article for newspaper

461
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,400
you can't include

462
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,570
technical details so every time anything
inside to particularly in securities

463
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,070
order is this

464
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:25,639
uh... tendency to say oh about unions
are coming and it's because of

465
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,169
this one little thing

466
00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:30,170
when the actual arguments very different

467
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,190
and more complicated than that

468
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:36,020
and so on this because they didn't
specify anything about

469
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,860
i got uh...

470
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,639
uh... the president's guiding briggs

471
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,720
i don't know if last name but it

472
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,740
persons

473
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,920
putting this my slides that he's uh...

474
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,870
some higher up the

475
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,159
abuses

476
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,550
the vast majority of pilots and products
out there

477
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,610
that support visit b span energy
profiles button

478
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,928
used an electric meters

479
00:23:57,929 --> 00:24:02,550
are based on the number two fifty and
not bt i took on twenty four o'clock

480
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:06,970
utilizing requiring the security and
standardization the smart energy profile

481
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,519
box

482
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,050
uh... n

483
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:15,659
he also says dot at the end i'd consider
this blog heat shield however has shown

484
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,640
that politicians of media provides will
react to anything that serves that

485
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,940
purpose

486
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,700
so because colony

487
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,300
susan that's kinda creepy i had to break

488
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,270
this chapter

489
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:29,879
hahahaha

490
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,860
so uh... that issue

491
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,760
and he is just the x eighty two
microcontroller

492
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,879
which is a very obscure

493
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,659
unit and

494
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:45,460
them deployed recently organic products

495
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,289
as i've been critical but splashing five
kilobytes of ram

496
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:52,940
as progress ordinary essence all still

497
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,760
and it has

498
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,410
low-power when sleeping as everything
else does but

499
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,400
uh...

500
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,220
so it has i mean it was because the

501
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,060
not clear while he's back

502
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,840
uh... is our president japan twenty four
twenty was

503
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,559
formal he conceded that

504
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:11,330
vis-a-vis number twenty

505
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,460
two fifty

506
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,990
whizzed not overall because if they
don't expose its keys by espy ana

507
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:23,590
but there was no wire that you can stick
needles into watching he's being leather

508
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:27,429
citric acid as he concluded that the
number two fifty was secure because the

509
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,270
committee had

510
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,160
decreed

511
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,750
uh...

512
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,870
the reasons why this is market is
because

513
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:41,510
there is uh... gatech portents gatech
port was made by a small consulting firm

514
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,860
that was making

515
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,590
it second checked

516
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:49,330
i believe this is their first chip
design of the several expression

517
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,199
is also

518
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,350
uh... important because the

519
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,709
x eighty two is designed to be thrown
into any others

520
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:01,050
so if you are manufacturing uh... sound
cards

521
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:05,659
and you need to add extra
microcontroller into that same chet

522
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,080
you can get their design is parallel

523
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,250
compiler in future adventure

524
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,970
to they're designed as nothing about the
underlying

525
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,640
process that you're using a manufactured

526
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,559
they don't know which chemicals are
going to die

527
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:27,500
all their specifying as high level
source code

528
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,230
to inspire also ask that you

529
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,659
you filled with us

530
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:35,640
call the register transfer language
description

531
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,779
which just describes

532
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:42,670
how different things plug into each
other and what sorts of data between

533
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:46,470
their is no way to describe the fuse

534
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,450
you register transplant

535
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:54,180
and there's no way to describe a single
bit the people

536
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:59,120
to making anything program requires that
you talk to outside memory

537
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,439
and talking outside never you have to be
over memory cards

538
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,330
accessing memory by cisco kid

539
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:08,020
not too complicated for mac controller
pins

540
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:14,550
it takes a lot of home to grappled value
from memory obliterated

541
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,340
so

542
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,500
the uh...

543
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,559
so worth the trip is being programmed by

544
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:22,950
it serial port

545
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,139
order by radio

546
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:28,370
it might have some defense mechanisms
but when you program it by j checked

547
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,570
with the insight

548
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,010
towards the caller

549
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:31,730
which is

550
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,970
this clubs here an extended i still have
these exact

551
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,210
tensions

552
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:40,590
on every board that uses the strip

553
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,470
in order to break into a all you have to
do is buying

554
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,020
the debug inbox

555
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,830
plug it up to the border

556
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,879
and ask for a copy of all

557
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,119
because they never implemented a fuse or

558
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:56,889
protection bit or anything else to
defendant

559
00:27:56,889 --> 00:28:01,929
as a manufacturer of the board there's
absolutely no way that you can

560
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:07,680
tell the chip not to accept further
dividing batch

561
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,590
so this is actually more vulnerable
budget buster keaton analysis is not

562
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,340
only can you get he's out

563
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,770
you can also get all of the programming
out patches return at

564
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,770
and you don't have to do anything for
good

565
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:25,040
you've just plug it up and requested a

566
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:30,760
but at the time i discovered this i was
hoping

567
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,060
some sort of uh... countenance that all
i do agree that you can't stop

568
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,149
because

569
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,350
this was so

570
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,469
uh... boring to break and because

571
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,320
the company was so friendly when i
reported the problem

572
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,450
i thought it should have got to break
the competitive producto

573
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,390
so that i grab a check on twenty four
thirty which is the second generation

574
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,530
chip from texas and

575
00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:00,190
and internally this is the same might
processor

576
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,260
as

577
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,110
every other second-generation ship the

578
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,590
thus far has shipped

579
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:11,470
uh... so just like the mt fifty other
eighty to fifteen f or radio

580
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,679
but instead you have

581
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:14,590
instantly x eighty two

582
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,740
microcontroller

583
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,590
you have an eight a fifty one nine

584
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:22,629
which is very very desperately related
taxes

585
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,130
it's uh...

586
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,930
it's too but never asked i like

587
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:32,250
protocol except that the daylight to
share thomasville

588
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,340
so this is the target for that i
attacked

589
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,530
you plug

590
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:43,250
voltage in route to it and then it runs
by p p sixty picnicking

591
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,190
stands

592
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:47,060
uni p packets to a do all that fun stuff

593
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,320
it's not big enough to

594
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,780
run asa sage

595
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:58,700
not the purpose of it used to park in
another area

596
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,770
when you got it

597
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,639
there isn't it

598
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,970
and initialization sequence after brown

599
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:06,039
soon you first can act on the wilson

600
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,230
libel tunes

601
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:10,039
to cause it to an earth debugging base

602
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:12,520
and this is always allow

603
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,510
once you're in

604
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,660
there a different message across

605
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,679
uh... you can erase the entire chip

606
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:18,330
you can get it

607
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,840
copy that program counter

608
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,459
you can do about instruction

609
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,490
execute code that you get that

610
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,740
instead of what it would be fetching

611
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,409
from instruction number

612
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:31,690
you can also request its version

613
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,770
uh... and that it sends you a reply

614
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:38,730
and begin your many specify how much
reply

615
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,100
uh... so

616
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,908
i took the eclipse outboard dimension
beginning

617
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:47,230
and they have provided stopper
buckminster

618
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:50,799
so that instead of having to use anyone
else's debugger abused by her

619
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,320
and as part of this

620
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,809
in writing all of them

621
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:54,940
where by

622
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,030
new everything wasn't tough

623
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,740
surgery nationalize it a do this

624
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,180
all there is a pulling inverted resupply
and well

625
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,130
which is sort of paused the check

626
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:11,810
and makes it beginning they're going to
get ready to start executing

627
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:12,879
from a fresh start

628
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,530
this is an agreement

629
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:17,270
but while this is low

630
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:21,350
to pulses on uh... debugging pop up

631
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:24,290
them in a pretty high begins in

632
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,230
uh... environment

633
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,120
then i said traffic to it

634
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,270
it's big idea

635
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,470
that uh... it's big again and he's

636
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,460
method first

637
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,310
uh... which is very happy because
everything sent just as you would bring

638
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,020
it up here

639
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,800
so on every right-wing instabilities

640
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,659
to deport delivery falling into sample

641
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,919
so if you are writing at you want to
write

642
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:52,920
thirty-four he'd wait 'til this edge to
assert the line

643
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,360
there is a little delay between and then
when the clock line falls the daylights

644
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,729
out

645
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:02,280
so at the white house britain here
sample here

646
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:09,280
and he continued to the rest of the this

647
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:19,460
if

648
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,350
instructions

649
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,290
which

650
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,190
specified

651
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,690
with one

652
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,190
he puts it which describe

653
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,410
whether or not

654
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,950
you're sending

655
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,320
uh... extra bites uh... ravinus

656
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,820
you want to

657
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,559
execute instruction debug instruction
map

658
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:43,740
you would send execute code bizarre
bites

659
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,649
it will return

660
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:47,489
an optional quite or morrow

661
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:50,310
but it never comes word

662
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:55,740
uh... and that there's a a locket missus
way amber rock with yet

663
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,630
with a locket works is the particular
adverse flash memory wounded in or

664
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,760
register as the chip turns on

665
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,200
and then not roaster is

666
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,190
looked at every attempt to develop a
chat

667
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,460
when it's locked

668
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,740
you're allowed to run

669
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,860
only these three connects

670
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,620
you can request detainment keeping

671
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,619
erase the chat

672
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:21,060
or you can request status chip you're
not allowed to run wine

673
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:25,030
you're not allowed to rewrite very about
skip instruction in outlook

674
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:29,240
pre-programmed connor you're not a lot
to any of the things that money

675
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,370
make it easy to correct it

676
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:35,310
you're only allowed in the race it and

677
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:38,399
they're thinking was that after the
chips that you raised there's nothing

678
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,380
left for you to take

679
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:45,480
there's no harm in allowing race check

680
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,500
it's also unnecessary elaborate shirt
because

681
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,150
if you give the leverage

682
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,350
and device is broken in the field

683
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,379
appeal technician for for update

684
00:33:56,379 --> 00:34:03,379
without having the rights to rip
anything out of place

685
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:06,519
problem is that the chipper racer
commanded

686
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:10,179
only races left

687
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:13,060
by his side me specifies manual

688
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,389
this was not an advocate

689
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:19,299
whatever it is all program the

690
00:34:19,299 --> 00:34:20,688
security qa

691
00:34:20,688 --> 00:34:23,668
it does in a race brown

692
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:27,029
and on the tell if if you want

693
00:34:27,029 --> 00:34:30,799
important because he is

694
00:34:30,799 --> 00:34:34,629
all of data memories of that

695
00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:36,429
and all of

696
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:37,450
executed

697
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,948
all of instruction memory isn't flaps

698
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:44,639
or interminable

699
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,939
that you have this division in the
property tax points

700
00:34:47,938 --> 00:34:50,938
uh... function pointer always point to
instruct memory

701
00:34:50,938 --> 00:34:54,188
and the data pointer always point to
dinner

702
00:34:54,188 --> 00:34:58,419
if you try to resolve function pointer
to a bike

703
00:34:58,419 --> 00:35:01,729
imsi instead of getting the first by
that function

704
00:35:01,729 --> 00:35:04,790
you look at buy tickets in ram at the
same

705
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,750
address as functions

706
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,099
about has nothing to do pumped

707
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:10,769
they're two separate

708
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:16,109
memories that just happen to have
overlapping addressed

709
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:19,209
point have to be compiled one eleven si

710
00:35:19,209 --> 00:35:23,078
you have to be able to pass a strange
pranab

711
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,080
without being

712
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:31,080
doing uh... conditioner walnut function
road which memory restaurants located

713
00:35:33,489 --> 00:35:35,689
to in our memory out of

714
00:35:35,689 --> 00:35:36,888
this division

715
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:40,109
as president by norman ships where

716
00:35:40,109 --> 00:35:42,709
everything's combined with single

717
00:35:42,709 --> 00:35:45,669
ghana p_c_p_ appointed to function
baller

718
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:49,049
you can read that part

719
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:52,049
uh... is also issue whether premise exp

720
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:57,889
some harvard you're not be able to
execute

721
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,959
and this is all forced by the compiler

722
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:03,839
every compiler by every batter that's
not

723
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,179
specific to

724
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:07,589
the compilers at this trip

725
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:09,609
every compiler for every portraiture

726
00:36:09,609 --> 00:36:11,719
remove every cost down

727
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:14,319
even those that are never

728
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:19,299
uh... britain to

729
00:36:19,299 --> 00:36:23,029
including

730
00:36:23,029 --> 00:36:27,599
and ordered like this chip all you have
to do is erased the chat

731
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,479
then it ought to dot all the data and
pipe and or fire

732
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:35,388
that you have a copy of

733
00:36:35,389 --> 00:36:38,169
eight kilobytes of ram

734
00:36:38,169 --> 00:36:42,209
becuase probably in the blast or compact

735
00:36:42,209 --> 00:36:44,270
because of provocations new

736
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,619
the upper poorer

737
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:47,729
arno and be good between

738
00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:48,808
apartments

739
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:51,519
to deep sleep a little while at
princeton

740
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:53,848
well the lower four will be

741
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:56,609
wiped out

742
00:36:56,609 --> 00:36:57,589
what i

743
00:36:57,589 --> 00:37:00,409
reported this to gadget blog

744
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:02,400
bain came back to me as well

745
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,749
for kilobytes is a a lot

746
00:37:04,749 --> 00:37:05,729
uh... member

747
00:37:05,729 --> 00:37:09,348
america eight kilobytes of ram or how
could anyone possibly

748
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:15,489
find a key in all about

749
00:37:15,489 --> 00:37:20,849
i thought about for a second and uh...
you know you can use uh...

750
00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:22,120
uh... you look for the entry

751
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:26,299
today's for kilobytes will be thanks
linden having twenty

752
00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:29,459
that's the that he will be perfectly
rambo

753
00:37:29,459 --> 00:37:31,578
well-dressed brown what

754
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:35,679
uh... but i thought how long would it
take to reports back up

755
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:39,880
psychologist rightness of eight events
explain

756
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,080
here's how it works

757
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,419
tell me how long it would be a bond
funds he's doing that

758
00:37:44,419 --> 00:37:48,009
as equal called philippine will be
released data

759
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,249
without

760
00:37:49,249 --> 00:37:53,879
and becoming batons and uh... forceps

761
00:37:53,879 --> 00:37:56,779
and this is just doing a sliding window

762
00:37:56,779 --> 00:37:59,200
uh... you take the wind up in twenty
eight

763
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,519
that's why didn't you just

764
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:04,488
things like that by eight minutes apart

765
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:08,249
assuming that the he will be quite a
while

766
00:38:08,249 --> 00:38:09,529
and

767
00:38:09,529 --> 00:38:12,479
you compare that intense syntax usenet

768
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:14,419
but have not yet occurred

769
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:16,879
until those packets make sense

770
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,169
and nbs

771
00:38:18,169 --> 00:38:23,388
into second second checked the part of
ram harlem things to buy fault

772
00:38:23,389 --> 00:38:29,589
in four seconds of jekyll

773
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:32,699
case actually a way to defend against
this and

774
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:34,179
software

775
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:36,039
that's why it is

776
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:38,409
center dr proper via

777
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:41,169
informing their apartments this because

778
00:38:41,169 --> 00:38:44,729
if you're a black eye and there's no way
to fix it

779
00:38:44,729 --> 00:38:47,339
i can understand wanting to keep quiet
in this case

780
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:49,599
you can't change

781
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,119
your

782
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,430
uh... memory allocation

783
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,388
by preprocessor directives mc

784
00:38:55,389 --> 00:38:56,730
so if you had

785
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:59,969
uh... the constant strength to which was
hello world

786
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:04,159
and you put this little work here at
underscore underscore coat

787
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:08,849
that it starts at income primary instead
of the gramm

788
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:12,019
this means that it's inflation rates
you're not able to prove you read and

789
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:12,988
write

790
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:15,449
but at the same time

791
00:39:15,449 --> 00:39:21,689
is protected and that the uh... tracker
katrina without bypassing and security

792
00:39:21,689 --> 00:39:26,489
it's not enough to just erase all that
breaks the strike you

793
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,949
uh... and they keep it did

794
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,030
an application that

795
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,989
d and two hundred their very first
application no

796
00:39:32,989 --> 00:39:36,799
was on how to do this to sabrina

797
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:40,069
uh... begin and try to do it for
security reasons they had the issue that

798
00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:41,219
we

799
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:43,279
eight kilobytes of ram

800
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:46,309
sometimes they would run out of time

801
00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:49,780
and they would have a stack overflow not
a sense of uh... stacked

802
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,949
oracle

803
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:56,229
but in a sense of the stack actually
growing so deep that it collided

804
00:39:56,229 --> 00:39:59,658
into the bottom line

805
00:39:59,659 --> 00:40:03,099
uh... which is never confirms

806
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:05,609
cindy releases the

807
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:08,359
expect actor or documentation what

808
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:09,269
they can say look

809
00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:12,109
twenty-something secure with acha

810
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,699
you have to

811
00:40:13,699 --> 00:40:17,430
look at this application now can you
help me capture that everything that you

812
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,919
intend to be kept

813
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:21,299
secret is hell

814
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:24,879
uh... if you were to store your keys in
this part of our

815
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:28,400
and you've only copied down into the he
rented

816
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,279
never cop ground

817
00:40:30,279 --> 00:40:32,829
in mind that you please reset after
ratio

818
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:35,729
he would also worries the key aggressor

819
00:40:35,729 --> 00:40:41,388
and a copy you five hundred would not be
another chip

820
00:40:41,389 --> 00:40:45,169
there are so are quite smart

821
00:40:45,169 --> 00:40:51,299
if u mainstreaming equal hello world to
try to call for an afro it won't work

822
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:54,489
because the value of fluids an editor

823
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:58,569
is the address incur member that
contains the local

824
00:40:58,569 --> 00:41:01,759
it's not the addressee in data memory

825
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,739
and perhaps always looking data memory
by the fall

826
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:11,299
so if you intend to have some strings in
flash and other strains of the uh...

827
00:41:11,299 --> 00:41:14,049
to tell you want the used to going to be
around

828
00:41:14,049 --> 00:41:14,940
but you want

829
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,959
the

830
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:18,629
uh... ever messages intel baat

831
00:41:18,629 --> 00:41:21,499
you have to have separate preta porte

832
00:41:21,499 --> 00:41:24,459
or a beautiful printout with

833
00:41:24,459 --> 00:41:26,029
character substitution is

834
00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:27,739
t_v_ do you do

835
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:29,409
uh... percent sign s

836
00:41:29,409 --> 00:41:30,969
references train

837
00:41:30,969 --> 00:41:34,879
maybe have to make capital s_ referred
stringing would work

838
00:41:34,879 --> 00:41:38,969
they're all sorts of other houses yet

839
00:41:38,969 --> 00:41:40,809
and it's for that reason date

840
00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:43,670
no one actually but influence this
defense

841
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,439
so far

842
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:50,180
salute to summarize these repressive
every

843
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,149
chip they've ever ship

844
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:55,899
prior to the upcoming chip kahn four
thirty series

845
00:41:55,899 --> 00:41:57,229
which he uses

846
00:41:57,229 --> 00:41:58,658
you must be four thirty

847
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:00,409
instead of the univ one

848
00:42:00,409 --> 00:42:03,739
every trip prior to that series is
overall

849
00:42:03,739 --> 00:42:08,909
and every application using a skeptic
spit he's

850
00:42:08,909 --> 00:42:14,279
together any safety device that is
manufactured prior to a month ago

851
00:42:14,279 --> 00:42:20,689
it's vulnerable to i did this in fact
one against him

852
00:42:20,689 --> 00:42:22,549
third-generation succumbing out

853
00:42:22,549 --> 00:42:27,000
and they support more bastions cases
ever they're using the are

854
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,719
cortex and three

855
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:33,809
which does include at gatech action
please

856
00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:37,949
uh... and this is done dot patterns

857
00:42:37,949 --> 00:42:39,730
he's on an ipod b

858
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,569
about at this point

859
00:42:41,569 --> 00:42:45,849
the chip at four thirty in st uses uh...
attack fees

860
00:42:45,849 --> 00:42:48,069
anesthesia submitted in flash memory

861
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:50,619
so in the japan for thirty turns on

862
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:52,989
it has a little piece of clothing

863
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:54,220
that copies

864
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,698
control down from flash memory

865
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,549
into a register

866
00:42:59,549 --> 00:43:01,379
in uh... jacob controller

867
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:07,719
cd become blocked out of digi-tech
controller just after

868
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:10,359
particular word memory is

869
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:12,769
eight five five

870
00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:17,118
fits all zeros are tall ones your life

871
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,779
this means that people would be easy to
later

872
00:43:19,779 --> 00:43:22,949
unload by a software

873
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:24,749
uh... it's very difficult to know

874
00:43:24,749 --> 00:43:26,999
zero coupon

875
00:43:26,999 --> 00:43:29,368
midwives on machine but they live

876
00:43:29,369 --> 00:43:30,639
so we can

877
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:35,609
injector because nothing but blackout
blues two bytes of memory

878
00:43:35,609 --> 00:43:37,578
making false heroes

879
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:40,159
and then you can pick up if they talked
about

880
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,299
uh... and

881
00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:45,139
that would require far cut education
department executions easy in the most

882
00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:46,109
people thirty

883
00:43:46,109 --> 00:43:49,419
because it's allowed to execute brown

884
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:51,209
ends

885
00:43:51,209 --> 00:43:52,149
the earlier

886
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:56,499
japan for thirty chips there is a the
vulnerability to the bootloader

887
00:43:56,499 --> 00:43:59,009
seventy use

888
00:43:59,009 --> 00:44:00,389
but i think that

889
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:04,039
figure out how many bikes and your
password s crap

890
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:07,229
we'll get to that later

891
00:44:07,229 --> 00:44:10,729
because the issue this is being wielded
by corrupt

892
00:44:10,729 --> 00:44:14,479
so even if we assume that the false
statements properly set up such that

893
00:44:14,479 --> 00:44:15,479
when you

894
00:44:15,479 --> 00:44:18,698
turn the lights on

895
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:21,499
this allows access and you'll

896
00:44:21,499 --> 00:44:24,009
software enables it

897
00:44:24,009 --> 00:44:25,230
old what happens if

898
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,009
the software

899
00:44:27,009 --> 00:44:29,529
has a problem reading power

900
00:44:29,529 --> 00:44:32,699
we can force these problems but doesn't
this bibles

901
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:36,280
so it might be the protection his works
perfectly at three point three balls

902
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,419
but doesn't work at one point five pt

903
00:44:38,419 --> 00:44:41,689
with five hundred becomes unreadable

904
00:44:41,689 --> 00:44:46,669
rom memory permanent bascom is still

905
00:44:46,669 --> 00:44:48,169
and you get me

906
00:44:48,169 --> 00:44:51,479
dropped the ball very quickly on a
single cartridge

907
00:44:51,479 --> 00:44:52,490
to make

908
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:56,058
maybe just that tax from five hundred
stay

909
00:44:56,059 --> 00:45:00,049
while all other factors

910
00:45:00,049 --> 00:45:02,129
this is the numbered

911
00:45:02,129 --> 00:45:05,729
three-fifty are about

912
00:45:05,729 --> 00:45:10,009
chips are not yet available quantity but
they are sampling a few to their

913
00:45:10,009 --> 00:45:13,179
developer spot

914
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:16,509
mississippi trip

915
00:45:16,509 --> 00:45:20,239
uh...

916
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:24,509
uh...

917
00:45:24,509 --> 00:45:25,779
at this time

918
00:45:25,779 --> 00:45:30,229
them

919
00:45:30,229 --> 00:45:33,218
uh... sample

920
00:45:33,219 --> 00:45:40,099
uh...

921
00:45:40,099 --> 00:45:45,949
city display

922
00:45:45,949 --> 00:45:48,179
uh...

923
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:50,249
so

924
00:45:50,249 --> 00:45:53,848
if you're gonna faction of product using
this technology you have to recognize

925
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:59,319
that its likely impact will be able to
breakdown differences might

926
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:03,089
the only things at the site of our
security guns

927
00:46:03,089 --> 00:46:05,989
involve the lack of fifty to this area

928
00:46:05,989 --> 00:46:08,479
so

929
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:10,538
it's not as if it ever run out

930
00:46:10,539 --> 00:46:15,809
has significance and weight upon aquatic
life

931
00:46:15,809 --> 00:46:17,239
ends

932
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:20,869
into all of these big quake photography
to secure

933
00:46:20,869 --> 00:46:24,349
in every day she in every market many
lives that we have a test one twenty

934
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:26,259
eight does not broke

935
00:46:26,259 --> 00:46:31,239
program looking at using elliptic prep
recover that will save balked

936
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:32,930
but by the fact that method

937
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:35,058
methods of any other areas

938
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:38,899
vanessa not only the chip level is it
shown in this part also what levels will

939
00:46:38,899 --> 00:46:40,249
show you mana

940
00:46:40,249 --> 00:46:41,589
that there's not much e

941
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,389
candid

942
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:48,889
to the second part i'm just going to
jump through a bunch of different

943
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,299
vulnerabilities that these house

944
00:46:51,299 --> 00:46:55,079
uh... i might not be able to explain all
this thing that simply less of a

945
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:56,279
something that

946
00:46:56,279 --> 00:46:58,959
you would like at clearer argument for

947
00:46:58,959 --> 00:47:01,919
or you would like further proof that it
works

948
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:05,729
uh... you can either six y bought for
the article that i'm referring to

949
00:47:05,729 --> 00:47:09,519
or you can contact me afterward and i'll
send you the full description

950
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:10,658
but i haven't

951
00:47:10,659 --> 00:47:15,889
time remaining inflection

952
00:47:15,889 --> 00:47:17,709
all

953
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,480
uh... access points themselves

954
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,390
are

955
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:22,499
at which connect

956
00:47:22,499 --> 00:47:26,129
low-power wireless network to another
networks which is a cellular network

957
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:28,779
were

958
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:31,539
usually right about that

959
00:47:31,539 --> 00:47:33,049
and they don't

960
00:47:33,049 --> 00:47:35,609
update it off

961
00:47:35,609 --> 00:47:38,999
uh... so how many of you interested only
in the next machine that was

962
00:47:38,999 --> 00:47:42,729
manufactured two years ago

963
00:47:42,729 --> 00:47:44,839
uh... five years old

964
00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:50,729
trusted that nicotine that day

965
00:47:50,729 --> 00:47:52,009
i mean even

966
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:56,629
openbsd and its default shout default
install can go back for

967
00:47:56,629 --> 00:47:59,439
there are remote

968
00:47:59,439 --> 00:48:02,538
but they still exist and i don't want
that comes out there's nothing that you

969
00:48:02,539 --> 00:48:03,589
can

970
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:07,159
delia update all of these because
they're out an appeal

971
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:11,339
the original manufacturer doesn't have
access to the resources to allow or on

972
00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:12,769
my part

973
00:48:12,769 --> 00:48:17,098
and a sleepover website seeking across
expecting attacks r_n_d_

974
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:19,769
control page for the wireless networks

975
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:23,058
you can send a link by e-mail
collectible it would be administered

976
00:48:23,059 --> 00:48:24,219
pages

977
00:48:24,219 --> 00:48:28,759
execute shop

978
00:48:28,759 --> 00:48:33,139
sports himself

979
00:48:33,139 --> 00:48:37,539
you'd

980
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:40,059
uh... or

981
00:48:40,059 --> 00:48:41,710
uh... model

982
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,220
or modern

983
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:47,578
uh... permafrost since the celts

984
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:49,829
it's just does not support

985
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:51,909
so

986
00:48:51,909 --> 00:48:56,299
that and then ask you for terry isn't
fast enough to spark plug

987
00:48:56,299 --> 00:48:58,279
so in the field

988
00:48:58,279 --> 00:49:03,869
not only will be brave traffic beyond
impacted by this acid heaps eyes

989
00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:08,059
but also there's unattractive ever hear
so if you still one of these questions

00:49:08,059 --> 00:49:12,129
your happened by feisty capra

991

they're all slightly non-standard

or another one of these under specific
chips you're stuck with it

1002
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,249
and you're not be able to upgrade q

1003

that a difference when

the attacker unionist parties

1009
00:50:06,499 --> 00:50:11,238
not being able to upgrade to cra
property is a very serious

1010
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:15,489
issue deployed of large network that's
you're not able to begin talking about

1011
00:50:15,489 --> 00:50:19,319
it

1012
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:22,599
gender preferences of these will vary by
jurisdiction

1013
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:26,709
in your please admitted megahertz in the
states please nine hundred

1014
00:50:26,709 --> 00:50:33,709
uh... tube reporters is popular reports

1015
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:39,299
also expected body

1016
00:50:39,299 --> 00:50:40,569
once he treats them out

1017
00:50:40,569 --> 00:50:45,849
fines applaud that's on everything you
can easily about to change

1018
00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:47,199
in the cases

1019
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:49,669
board for a couple slides back it has

1020
00:50:49,669 --> 00:50:52,200
this connector which connects to

1021
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,339
sir

1022
00:50:53,339 --> 00:50:57,919
so you can run this out to your pc and
you can actually talk alibis

1023
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:02,239
uh... what software they have net
blueberries

1024
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:06,189
it's quite common for them to spit out
the bugging informations after tax

1025
00:51:06,189 --> 00:51:10,949
at ninety six and a body bit slippery
nonstop

1026
00:51:10,949 --> 00:51:15,989
suddenly elephants he's not a bad needs
like that

1027
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:21,029
you also know which part of the chip
contains the lives of the interested ins

1028
00:51:21,029 --> 00:51:23,299
a backpack the reconfigured

1029
00:51:23,299 --> 00:51:28,089
so the case the at six twelve eleven
o'clock pride to capture acts

1030
00:51:28,089 --> 00:51:31,659
ability pakistan for arsenal path report
very quickly

1031
00:51:31,659 --> 00:51:35,939
all i have to do is take needle into and
he said

1032
00:51:35,939 --> 00:51:40,259
the mystique and and yes the cape cod

1033
00:51:40,259 --> 00:51:43,029
these three are on the corner

1034
00:51:43,029 --> 00:51:46,849
so i know that i can tap since fifteen
sixteen seventeen

1035
00:51:46,849 --> 00:51:49,919
on the upper right corner arts yet

1036
00:51:49,919 --> 00:51:51,249
all of the keys out

1037
00:51:51,249 --> 00:51:52,488
and i also

1038
00:51:52,489 --> 00:51:56,119
noted on a given boarded exalted site

1039
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:58,170
so that these three kids in this corner

1040
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:00,559
an adult trap

1041
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,009
uh... these days are also used to
identify because they very rarely have

1042
00:52:04,009 --> 00:52:05,649
support comes next

1043
00:52:05,649 --> 00:52:08,390
you won't have pastor or sister on

1044
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:09,459
this line

1045
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:13,578
instead he'll how a few wires paralleled
one another

1046
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:18,569
humming out of that region of the board
and moving toward the back door

1047
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:23,079
uh... as opposed to these other lines
which have passengers doctors

1048
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:26,239
um... these parts very obviously analog

1049
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,119
signals

1050
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:32,049
well these are very obviously digital

1051
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:36,159
connecting tube doesn't require
soldering because require lab

1052
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:39,210
all requires her to hypodermic syringes

1053
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:43,849
uh... desired twenty gauge for
two-and-a-half inch barrels abuser

1054
00:52:43,849 --> 00:52:45,929
rather large simmons

1055
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:52,009
and again is sticking in there and it
much everything that was approx

1056
00:52:52,009 --> 00:52:53,539
this is a

1057
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:56,319
pictured recapping the

1058
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,369
one of us

1059
00:52:58,369 --> 00:53:00,559
uh... so we needed to use biceps

1060
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,159
you can catch dinner prepared you can
also heavily radio

1061
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:06,659
you can assessment

1062
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:10,139
i'll have to do is wireimage radio would
be

1063
00:53:10,139 --> 00:53:15,509
sent a packets major texans are rights
they don't get dropped you said

1064
00:53:15,509 --> 00:53:17,739
and wait for the chip to crash

1065
00:53:17,739 --> 00:53:21,670
and you know when it crashes because all
of the input-output considered

1066
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:25,599
selectable

1067
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,819
they'll become input pins on everything

1068
00:53:28,819 --> 00:53:32,909
so he has a particular output game seo
serial port

1069
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:36,269
at ibc report will always output a while

1070
00:53:36,269 --> 00:53:37,939
unanswered

1071
00:53:37,939 --> 00:53:39,379
if you have uh...

1072
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,819
okay five calories a startling that down
to zero

1073
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:44,719
value will remain a lot

1074
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:46,379
until the chip resets

1075
00:53:46,379 --> 00:53:48,939
and then that can falls down it was here

1076
00:53:48,939 --> 00:53:50,359
what

1077
00:53:50,359 --> 00:53:52,960
and you could have uh... a positive
response spin

1078
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,589
i'm working on that

1079
00:53:54,589 --> 00:53:56,999
opposing foca conspirists

1080
00:53:56,999 --> 00:54:02,939
busiest wiring overworked startling
kerja isaac meeting with the crash

1081
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:04,879
uh... once you have a crash

1082
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,329
uh... it's actually very easy to extract
memory chip

1083
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,539
even block

1084
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,139
and uh...

1085
00:54:12,139 --> 00:54:13,579
the paper that was evident

1086
00:54:13,579 --> 00:54:16,839
thirty-six workshop but technologies

1087
00:54:16,839 --> 00:54:19,558
in which ided line buzzing

1088
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:23,199
to extract memory from the device

1089
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:27,559
giving returning programming into flash

1090
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:31,139
looking for haha relevant followed by a
return which would elevate my access

1091
00:54:31,139 --> 00:54:32,609
button bootloader

1092
00:54:32,609 --> 00:54:36,199
and then i could just asking for a copy
of the past

1093
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:40,809
of in this works in three to four sect

1094
00:54:40,809 --> 00:54:46,269
these memories of small and the i was
very regular degenerate

1095
00:54:46,269 --> 00:54:48,758
this is a lettuce in gear

1096
00:54:48,759 --> 00:54:49,770
electric meter

1097
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:51,459
and you can see uh...

1098
00:54:51,459 --> 00:54:53,698
uh... twenty four c thirty two

1099
00:54:53,699 --> 00:54:55,009
is the liberal mister

1100
00:54:55,009 --> 00:54:58,269
that incidents of nike c_e_o_

1101
00:54:58,269 --> 00:55:00,209
and i can see is particularly fun
because it's

1102
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:02,709
it supports what last

1103
00:55:02,709 --> 00:55:03,908
if you stick

1104
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:06,199
this ridge there syringe there

1105
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:08,239
and hardship for our

1106
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:11,220
that you can talk to this chap who
conducts contest

1107
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:15,189
and you can give this while court is
still running

1108
00:55:15,189 --> 00:55:19,999
the master device will actually own
alway talking to chip nazis that you are

1109
00:55:19,999 --> 00:55:21,390
already talking

1110
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:24,959
as which in effect what

1111
00:55:24,959 --> 00:55:26,899
uh... this is the

1112
00:55:26,899 --> 00:55:28,880
parted that

1113
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,469
pickup bombs and sporting

1114
00:55:31,469 --> 00:55:35,069
implemented

1115
00:55:35,069 --> 00:55:37,250
as well and a little bit earlier and i
did

1116
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:41,459
using just this poor running out ah...
serial port all a sport does

1117
00:55:41,459 --> 00:55:44,669
is watch the i hope and of

1118
00:55:44,669 --> 00:55:46,669
the are

1119
00:55:46,669 --> 00:55:49,078
and otherwise connected together

1120
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:49,999
uh...

1121
00:55:49,999 --> 00:55:53,448
so that it spits it out through the
serial port all you have to notice that

1122
00:55:53,449 --> 00:55:56,729
the serial port is with proper products

1123
00:55:56,729 --> 00:56:01,718
uh... actually spent more time figuring
out the barn ratnam enough

1124
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:04,680
uh... in the philadelphia news it's
something that uh...

1125
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:08,529
four thousand three hundred and fifty
five book

1126
00:56:08,529 --> 00:56:13,799
uh... be changed out a a crystal last
moves on

1127
00:56:13,799 --> 00:56:16,230
so uh... crystal specified that would
have been

1128
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:19,939
ninety six hundred bought switch to
another

1129
00:56:19,939 --> 00:56:26,689
with them better tools for stepping
decentralize protocols

1130
00:56:26,689 --> 00:56:31,729
prosperity compatibility disconnected a

00:56:33,229 --> 00:56:37,158
so with many car hyper terminal you can
talk to do

00:56:47,509 --> 00:56:49,739
using vista but

1137
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:50,619
um...

1138
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:52,220
because daytime t_v_ news

1139
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:56,308
evelyn hardware are these fees is their
vulnerability is that there are also

other methods for green cards for

1141
00:56:59,259 --> 00:57:01,219
that's often out of the voter

00:57:22,709 --> 00:57:26,288
antacid presents the password it make
sure that the

1150
00:57:26,289 --> 00:57:27,939
receiving a box the victim

1151
00:57:27,939 --> 00:57:32,069
is never waiting for a bite because

1152
00:57:32,069 --> 00:57:35,179
wherever would wait for a bike and make
sure that that fight is already being

1153
00:57:35,179 --> 00:57:36,149
transmitted

1154
00:57:36,149 --> 00:57:38,348
and i stretch out timing of it

1155
00:57:38,349 --> 00:57:42,459
to ensure that this doesn't bosnias

1156
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,848
uh... so that

1157
00:57:43,849 --> 00:57:46,740
the victimized runs in a aloo paneer
checks

1158
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:52,029
all of the different uh... passwords
that are available

1159
00:57:52,029 --> 00:57:54,369
if our trade reports that we pay

1160
00:57:54,369 --> 00:57:55,750
twenty eight years

1161
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:57,789
or thirty to twelve o'clock

1162
00:57:57,789 --> 00:58:00,789
politicized i couldn't figure out how
many

1163
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:02,709
bites at my desk correct

1164
00:58:02,709 --> 00:58:05,509
but using the timing attack

1165
00:58:05,509 --> 00:58:08,869
so that i can measure the trying to pass
the comparison

1166
00:58:08,869 --> 00:58:12,979
uh... again making sure that it is
waiting admitted never which for me to

1167
00:58:12,979 --> 00:58:14,339
send it back

1168
00:58:14,339 --> 00:58:18,009
then i'm not sure how long the
comparison stick

1169
00:58:18,009 --> 00:58:22,400
and she's even if thats disabled i can
use a voltage coaching attack

1170
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,319
to skip through that

1171
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:28,249
uh... in that case indicates get
personal instruction so it's a asking

1172
00:58:28,249 --> 00:58:29,479
for the password

1173
00:58:29,479 --> 00:58:31,428
is one instruction

1174
00:58:31,429 --> 00:58:35,099
where it has an inch statements is

1175
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:38,449
the privileges art sufficient to read
this

1176
00:58:38,449 --> 00:58:39,639
them

1177
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:41,959
skipped the the read

1178
00:58:41,959 --> 00:58:43,839
or send a another knowledge

1179
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,499
but if you skip that one instruction

1180
00:58:46,499 --> 00:58:49,209
then it sends you the password and then
you know the passes you never have to

1181
00:58:49,209 --> 00:58:50,969
remember again

1182
00:58:50,969 --> 00:58:54,400
and you you can't have uh...
self-destructs their because it might

1183
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,779
accidentally fail

1184
00:58:56,779 --> 00:59:00,439
uh...

1185
00:59:00,439 --> 00:59:02,750
sitting in the case was i mean if i
could just

1186
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:06,049
sent the commands saying that uh...

1187
00:59:06,049 --> 00:59:09,538
uh... want to speak to the look to the
device then i said i don't know what

1188
00:59:09,539 --> 00:59:11,919
they're going to provide for their
knowledge about

1189
00:59:11,919 --> 00:59:14,060
from the rising

1190
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:17,990
beds ah... that'd knowledge about when
it since the last bit of the technology

1191
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:19,988
begin counting

1192
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:23,439
and i keep counting until it tells me
that my guess is wrong

1193
00:59:23,439 --> 00:59:27,609
and as this is happening i send out the
bags

1194
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:31,429
and this is that my program it's a mask
from from see how to do with thousand

1195
00:59:31,429 --> 00:59:34,759
participants dump it disassemble it can
read it

1196
00:59:34,759 --> 00:59:38,989
uh... and then you can reverse engineer

1197
00:59:38,989 --> 00:59:41,859
the password itself is composed of
sixteen

1198
00:59:41,859 --> 00:59:45,308
sixteen-bit winners to interrupt
handlers in memory

1199
00:59:45,309 --> 00:59:48,779
the reason abductor table because they
don't trust the compiler vendors to

1200
00:59:48,779 --> 00:59:51,189
randomized password

1201
00:59:51,189 --> 00:59:54,828
uh... within this a question of how many
are actually wrapped

1202
00:59:54,829 --> 00:59:57,109
uh... too

1203
00:59:57,109 --> 01:00:01,719
troubles bacarella problem of the german
graduate students got to get their name

1204
01:00:01,719 --> 01:00:03,749
together would be forty best because

1205
01:00:03,749 --> 01:00:07,848
but the children fifty-six there in the
password citizen every bro

1206
01:00:07,849 --> 01:00:10,219
use the word of this past week

1207
01:00:10,219 --> 01:00:11,630
uh...

1208
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:13,800
the reset doctor the

1209
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,629
addresses which execution begins

1210
01:00:16,629 --> 01:00:20,549
is always the very first bite a flash
memory because all the compilers

1211
01:00:20,549 --> 01:00:22,999
brokered upward for the bottom of flash

1212
01:00:22,999 --> 01:00:27,408
and then vbs decadents are always zero

1213
01:00:27,409 --> 01:00:29,809
because every instruction is even a lot

1214
01:00:29,809 --> 01:00:31,459
if you look we're too good

1215
01:00:31,459 --> 01:00:33,390
it's lisa gordon that is always a cigar

1216
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:35,169
so that which is now

1217
01:00:35,169 --> 01:00:36,960
so it's not going to

1218
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,789
tune in twenty-five that's

1219
01:00:38,789 --> 01:00:43,349
and that most of the uptown syringes
soon in gcc three low point in the same

1220
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:47,529
address pension people by little albee
wants

1221
01:00:47,529 --> 01:00:48,610
make up about that

1222
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:50,639
africa a photograph

1223
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:55,349
and is for every interrupt anything is
never trigger so if i don't write a

1224
01:00:55,349 --> 01:00:56,160
handler

1225
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,740
for of button press

1226
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:59,609
or four o'clock triggering

1227
01:00:59,609 --> 01:01:01,229
both leaders will be clear

1228
01:01:01,229 --> 01:01:03,569
both of those will be known in the best

1229
01:01:03,569 --> 01:01:07,269
and then because kylie grows from the
bottom of flesh in riyadh

1230
01:01:07,269 --> 01:01:11,299
i know that the hide that's will most
likely be clear

1231
01:01:11,299 --> 01:01:13,410
because all of the our cameras are in
need

1232
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:15,419
memory beneath that

1233
01:01:15,419 --> 01:01:19,609
uh... soul that will be wants to sell
his green area actually needs to be

1234
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:21,819
chapt

1235
01:01:21,819 --> 01:01:26,229
uh... if u run the password conversion
in simulation

1236
01:01:26,229 --> 01:01:30,299
and i did this by a wrapping up so i
just

1237
01:01:30,299 --> 01:01:34,849
loaded the last long in nature and then
the actual many littered it and it was

1238
01:01:34,849 --> 01:01:35,779
rampant

1239
01:01:35,779 --> 01:01:38,520
and i just had seen routines that would
retract bites at that

1240
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,429
too

1241
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:42,390
make a comparison routine a separate
function that i can call

1242
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:44,388
givin challenge

1243
01:01:44,389 --> 01:01:45,790
and i'd try it

1244
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:49,150
two hundred and fifty six passwords a
trade zero zero repeated zero one

1245
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:50,030
repeated

1246
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:52,039
all the way it to you asap repeated

1247
01:01:52,039 --> 01:01:55,249
and i counted how many clock cycles they
took execute

1248
01:01:55,249 --> 01:01:59,399
most bites in this case took six
thousand five hundred and forty three

1249
01:01:59,399 --> 01:02:02,308
some others took last said to be
differences out

1250
01:02:02,309 --> 01:02:04,979
provided that difference by two

1251
01:02:04,979 --> 01:02:09,558
is on the mcgrath two sides back to be

1252
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,959
the execution popped of two bites that
working people

1253
01:02:12,959 --> 01:02:16,098
was to quote cycles faster them one
where there are people because it took

1254
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:21,319
to clock cycles disabling my access

1255
01:02:21,319 --> 01:02:23,959
uh... do that if you add these together

1256
01:02:23,959 --> 01:02:25,379
you've got thirty two

1257
01:02:25,379 --> 01:02:28,219
and thirty two is the number of bikes in
the password

1258
01:02:28,219 --> 01:02:28,910
uh...

1259
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:30,859
so this tells me that's here's a look

1260
01:02:30,859 --> 01:02:33,429
sightseers era will appear once

1261
01:02:33,429 --> 01:02:37,069
eleven liquor sixteen times in three
will appear fifteen times

1262
01:02:37,069 --> 01:02:38,400
by also noted

1263
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,639
because eleven is on

1264
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:44,479
it will be the more significant by

1265
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:49,098
begins the lesson is goodbye to never be
on any given care

1266
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:52,789
uh... indictments that eleven hundred
being the first

1267
01:02:52,789 --> 01:02:55,279
word of five children will be

1268
01:02:55,279 --> 01:02:57,779
the reset factor

1269
01:02:57,779 --> 01:02:58,760
so you know

1270
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,529
of all of these words

1271
01:03:00,529 --> 01:03:02,680
that most of them are at the eleven

1272
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,999
three a

1273
01:03:03,999 --> 01:03:08,578
and one of them one very specific one is
actually eleven zero zero

1274
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:11,249
and that's what matters

1275
01:03:11,249 --> 01:03:14,770
uh... no intent deployed by cindy is
more interesting

1276
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:17,389
not all of these to be quite easy to get

1277
01:03:17,389 --> 01:03:21,259
but that doesn't matter because
intuitive fifty-six attempts ever used

1278
01:03:21,259 --> 01:03:26,379
my alphabet t thirty two particular
bites and i know there

1279
01:03:26,379 --> 01:03:28,868
quantities cited in america

1280
01:03:28,869 --> 01:03:31,929
this is a picture in a way for months
kelton

1281
01:03:31,929 --> 01:03:35,039
you would measure from dissension to
this edge

1282
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:40,369
the scheduling in what the victim tells
the master

1283
01:03:40,369 --> 01:03:43,049
uh... resolves the issue of this being
assured passport

1284
01:03:43,049 --> 01:03:46,739
so if you manufacturer thousand
biosensors

1285
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:50,279
using the same firmer image they all
have the same password

1286
01:03:50,279 --> 01:03:51,689
uh...

1287
01:03:51,689 --> 01:03:53,199
inner

1288
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:57,939
inductors paper re figure that we take
thirty two years to is a heat

1289
01:03:57,939 --> 01:03:58,999
do you think it would take

1290
01:03:58,999 --> 01:04:01,609
one hundred twenty eight years to bird
forces

1291
01:04:01,609 --> 01:04:05,899
he mentioned a script in britain which
would randomized the password

1292
01:04:05,899 --> 01:04:09,209
uh... sue the way he figured it was that

1293
01:04:09,209 --> 01:04:13,419
reasonably interrupted say the reset
vector points eleven hundred hacks

1294
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:16,169
rediff co dot com

1295
01:04:16,169 --> 01:04:18,868
his script runs through a former image

1296
01:04:18,869 --> 01:04:25,309
and for every american market picks an
unused piece of flattery

1297
01:04:25,309 --> 01:04:28,219
plays he puts uh...

1298
01:04:28,219 --> 01:04:30,650
the branch to the original have

1299
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:34,680
so that in this case we pass it on t_v_
three six two instead of eleven hundred

1300
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,109
and you can use an assembly line

1301
01:04:37,109 --> 01:04:41,449
uh... you can catcher production
processes that every boarded program has

1302
01:04:41,449 --> 01:04:43,939
a different password

1303
01:04:43,939 --> 01:04:45,939
brown

1304
01:04:45,939 --> 01:04:51,769
he if you search for his name on my blog
you'll find a copy of the script

1305
01:04:51,769 --> 01:04:55,058
but the chip is a lot of all to wilson's
budget

1306
01:04:55,059 --> 01:04:58,259
uh... this is an issue much sooner

1307
01:04:58,259 --> 01:05:00,679
in space the imprint use the output

1308
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:02,589
when it is low

1309
01:05:02,589 --> 01:05:04,099
this transistor here

1310
01:05:04,099 --> 01:05:05,120
will pull

1311
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,799
kill of two hundred

1312
01:05:07,799 --> 01:05:09,369
and when they is high

1313
01:05:09,369 --> 01:05:10,980
this transistor here will open

1314
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:15,049
and pulls you down two levels

1315
01:05:15,049 --> 01:05:19,419
but the decision to open or closed is
made by uh... a threshold and that

1316
01:05:19,419 --> 01:05:23,939
threshold changes with the supply
voltage

1317
01:05:23,939 --> 01:05:25,038
i dropped

1318
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:27,869
this line which is attacker control

1319
01:05:27,869 --> 01:05:29,210
down to happen next

1320
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:31,180
present value

1321
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:35,178
then this transistor will mess up

1322
01:05:35,179 --> 01:05:40,139
cut card will then make from voltage
down to brown in this falls a lot more

1323
01:05:40,139 --> 01:05:42,579
but only in this region instead

1324
01:05:42,579 --> 01:05:46,450
to make every everything that's up to
use by making the baltic

1325
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:48,658
drop to low

1326
01:05:48,659 --> 01:05:51,539
just before latches are set

1327
01:05:51,539 --> 01:05:58,539
and in the wrong value we caught copied
from one region of the trip to the next

1328
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:02,130
sir in the case it was before thirty
loader

1329
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:04,939
there's a little piece of collected
checks to see whether or not you are

1330
01:06:04,939 --> 01:06:06,928
about to begin to vote

1331
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:08,989
soon worries inversions if

1332
01:06:08,989 --> 01:06:11,349
deserve avoidable indicator

1333
01:06:11,349 --> 01:06:12,349
which there is

1334
01:06:12,349 --> 01:06:13,939
buchanan that point

1335
01:06:13,939 --> 01:06:17,578
a five five into memory at affect the
e_u_

1336
01:06:17,579 --> 01:06:18,500
and then that

1337
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,339
the pillar will

1338
01:06:20,339 --> 01:06:21,899
to see whether or not that's there

1339
01:06:21,899 --> 01:06:26,339
if it is this jay-z plus your
instruction will jump to itself

1340
01:06:26,339 --> 01:06:27,819
repeatedly

1341
01:06:27,819 --> 01:06:30,399
what is the jump look like she in

1342
01:06:30,399 --> 01:06:32,269
machine language

1343
01:06:32,269 --> 01:06:35,709
assisting it's just how many cycles is
dick

1344
01:06:35,709 --> 01:06:39,078
well atleast you never count cycles that
he given instruction because it there's

1345
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:41,809
more by cash its and this is the status
of

1346
01:06:41,809 --> 01:06:44,179
wannamaker controller all of your code

1347
01:06:44,179 --> 01:06:46,569
its cash everything to me touch quickly

1348
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:47,558
so

1349
01:06:47,559 --> 01:06:51,459
the way it works is that o_j_'s it takes
to clock cycles

1350
01:06:51,459 --> 01:06:54,658
it has a rising action which it adds to
the program para

1351
01:06:54,659 --> 01:06:57,949
superintendent points to be upcoming
instruction

1352
01:06:57,949 --> 01:06:59,659
nana falling aj

1353
01:06:59,659 --> 01:07:05,499
at which this per encounter plus two
value is placed back into the program

1354
01:07:05,499 --> 01:07:08,368
it's at this point but it does the
comparison

1355
01:07:08,369 --> 01:07:10,170
underwriting experience

1356
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:11,659
zero

1357
01:07:11,659 --> 01:07:14,179
this parameter to the gym construction

1358
01:07:14,179 --> 01:07:16,659
to the original program

1359
01:07:16,659 --> 01:07:21,649
and that is appalling educate which in
overwrite it

1360
01:07:21,649 --> 01:07:25,159
well what happens if this clock edge
messes up

1361
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:26,509
what happens if we got

1362
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:30,219
clark educate thinks that it's actually
running an ad instruction

1363
01:07:30,219 --> 01:07:34,789
instead of a job instruction

1364
01:07:34,789 --> 01:07:36,160
went to current counters always

1365
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,459
already pointing to the next instruction

1366
01:07:38,459 --> 01:07:40,658
so execution falls out

1367
01:07:40,659 --> 01:07:44,579
basically have this comparison hadn't
been made

1368
01:07:44,579 --> 01:07:50,759
and this isn't just any crockett excuses
one cottage in four

1369
01:07:50,759 --> 01:07:54,859
until the chip recess from old age

1370
01:07:54,859 --> 01:07:58,199
so you have many different attempts to
get that she can't do it with the morse

1371
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:02,069
code care potentiometer

1372
01:08:02,069 --> 01:08:03,038
and

1373
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:07,909
if you are trying to get it more
regularly there tricks you can do mrs

1374
01:08:07,909 --> 01:08:11,219
uh... scope recording of the voltage
line

1375
01:08:11,219 --> 01:08:15,769
of intimacy for thirty assistant
coaching at

1376
01:08:15,769 --> 01:08:19,509
every time it gets down from this
high-level

1377
01:08:19,509 --> 01:08:21,029
that's another car catch

1378
01:08:21,029 --> 01:08:25,069
the s_e_c_ must yet consumes power on
the clock attch

1379
01:08:25,069 --> 01:08:26,489
credits and

1380
01:08:26,488 --> 01:08:28,968
that's when he comes from and u

1381
01:08:28,969 --> 01:08:30,929
pc chip if you ever caught your pc

1382
01:08:30,929 --> 01:08:32,908
and generous words he

1383
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:35,969
soon people will be there for people in
the west

1384
01:08:35,969 --> 01:08:39,729
it's the same thing in a microcontroller
exceptionally running a lot slower and

1385
01:08:39,729 --> 01:08:43,059
its battery life and not cued up with
you're concerned about

1386
01:08:43,059 --> 01:08:44,549
but if you watch

1387
01:08:44,549 --> 01:08:45,969
when this happens

1388
01:08:45,969 --> 01:08:48,219
and you multiply that frequency up

1389
01:08:48,219 --> 01:08:50,099
using uh... phase locked loop

1390
01:08:50,099 --> 01:08:53,719
you could wind up getting this out in
parallel at sea

1391
01:08:53,719 --> 01:08:56,359
sixteen megahertz whereas the actual

1392
01:08:56,359 --> 01:09:00,279
that is coming at two megabytes

1393
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:03,819
and then that you created till the
device which would drop the voltage just

1394
01:09:03,819 --> 01:09:04,630
for the reason

1395
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:06,479
region it used to be dropped it

1396
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:09,920
you can't alcock cycle since the chip
begins executions

1397
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,489
he can do all these things to you

1398
01:09:12,488 --> 01:09:17,370
uh... improve the reliability of
coaching chip

1399
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:20,528
and when they found you cap

1400
01:09:20,529 --> 01:09:23,929
patch all shipments

1401
01:09:23,929 --> 01:09:27,190
and even with that new shipment to catch
pat some of it means breaking backward

1402
01:09:27,189 --> 01:09:28,358
compatibility

1403
01:09:28,359 --> 01:09:32,719
amber is unable to fix the amber to
fifty chip these they do not control the

1404
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:35,580
design of the microcontroller inside of
it

1405
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:40,100
the only option is to have a new chip
with the new microcontroller

1406
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:42,319
and issues a disclosure como

1407
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:45,389
did you ever since it was things

1408
01:09:45,389 --> 01:09:49,139
in security do it if there's a problem
you know a chain if you need add an

1409
01:09:49,139 --> 01:09:51,020
extra capacitor they'll tell you about
that

1410
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,450
but they'll never tell you

1411
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:58,349
about the an issue with the security of
the trip is that makes them look bad

1412
01:09:58,349 --> 01:10:01,119
and to all of these chips alone

1413
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:03,259
and uh...

1414
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:07,360
it's really hard to do breaks to get the
property right

1415
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,320
tamper detection and resistance again
they're impossible

1416
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,670
uh... who would you can do to

1417
01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:17,739
defend your board is to blow the
security fuse

1418
01:10:17,739 --> 01:10:20,829
uh... palestine didn't give it a word
and they say they can you get from

1419
01:10:20,829 --> 01:10:22,469
around

1420
01:10:22,469 --> 01:10:25,459
a look at the part number so yeah i
think i can

1421
01:10:25,459 --> 01:10:27,800
on to get on with the prime

1422
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,050
equipment

1423
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:33,270
before talking it up to my bsl cracker
others took it up to a regular j target

1424
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:34,399
after

1425
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:38,050
and she's more often than i'll see the
diffuse hasn't been blown

1426
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:41,059
these security merit is never enabled

1427
01:10:41,059 --> 01:10:45,570
and getting the code out of uh... the
somewhat secure devices is easy is

1428
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:48,440
getting it out of the amber chip

1429
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,199
the doesn't randomized

1430
01:10:50,199 --> 01:10:53,888
the bsl passwords the bootloader
passwords to make sure they

1431
01:10:53,889 --> 01:10:59,719
individual devices don't share passwords

1432
01:10:59,719 --> 01:11:02,859
yet to in riverdale but i'm not

1433
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:04,440
keeping anyone know

1434
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:10,018
out yet uh... are there any questions or

1435
01:11:10,019 --> 01:11:11,249
unit

1436
01:11:11,249 --> 01:11:13,110
may session um...

1437
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:16,940
our start off by asking you a few
questions like that arm we've heard

1438
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:20,530
also know that the budgets that are
using these chips today i mean

1439
01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:22,099
basically most electric

1440
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:25,870
meters and stuff like that i've been
talking about doing something pressuring

1441
01:11:25,870 --> 01:11:31,480
permafrost and stuff like that yet but
brought biking groceries for other types

1442
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:34,559
of devices before mister and were
worried where do you actually find these

1443
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:39,159
things today that silly at this point
the technologies revenue

1444
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:40,719
you've been able to buy

1445
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:41,570
chips

1446
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:44,340
affordably only four a year or two now

1447
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:48,660
soon they're not very often applied in
commercial products you won't find and

1448
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:50,139
cell phones because

1449
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:52,250
this technology computers lived

1450
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:55,090
that's a lot easier to add bluetooth
yourself

1451
01:11:55,090 --> 01:11:55,940
uh...

1452
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:59,669
the reason why i mentioned the
permafrost example is that a lot of the

1453
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:02,360
threat to the security of our academic

1454
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:03,719
instead of

1455
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:07,550
making their commercial products and
needing to make a return on a

1456
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:08,880
they will instead

1457
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,150
use academic funding knowing that
they're going to lose money

1458
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:14,530
uh... b

1459
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:17,139
used ah...

1460
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:19,539
envisages remarkable mother dot

1461
01:12:19,539 --> 01:12:21,800
so i had a projects where are they

1462
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:24,590
said appointees that works to make sure
the

1463
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:28,290
temperature and humidity within
everywhere

1464
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:30,909
it you can send a person with the probe

1465
01:12:30,909 --> 01:12:33,860
and it's very difficult to run wiring so

1466
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:35,170
aidid's

1467
01:12:35,170 --> 01:12:39,050
it's hard to put something in a while
but instead you can just drop a bunch of

1468
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:42,349
these into decontaminated brown

1469
01:12:42,349 --> 01:12:47,749
and then when the batteries died then
you get them out before them an assault

1470
01:12:47,749 --> 01:12:48,809
syrian

1471
01:12:48,809 --> 01:12:51,270
it's a new technology but not yet

1472
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:52,699
commonly deployed

1473
01:12:52,699 --> 01:12:55,530
the but from the looks of it

1474
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:58,800
security intimidation is sending these
things are not moving in the right

1475
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,120
direction are they i mean are you
optimistic about the actual saw all

1476
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:05,370
these things correctly nominal there are
thing

1477
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:08,369
three of us working in the security of
these devices

1478
01:13:08,369 --> 01:13:10,499
and

1479
01:13:10,499 --> 01:13:16,999
every time we look at a chip breaks that
uh... mike davis anti-war activist uh...

1480
01:13:16,999 --> 01:13:19,409
warm for the smart meters

1481
01:13:19,409 --> 01:13:24,799
uh... and when he did it do you get hit
by a deterrent tional techniques brehm

1482
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,949
works at that he didn't have to worry
about

1483
01:13:26,949 --> 01:13:29,308
user colonel separation because there is
not

1484
01:13:29,309 --> 01:13:31,580
he didn't have to worry about

1485
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:33,280
stack execution protection

1486
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,030
because there is not

1487
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:38,949
uh... all the defense mechanisms that
b_s_e_ industry is built up

1488
01:13:38,949 --> 01:13:41,638
to defend itself from these contacts

1489
01:13:41,639 --> 01:13:45,360
don't exist because the cost money and
the cost

1490
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,179
and surface area and checked and that

1491
01:13:48,179 --> 01:13:50,349
nick australia

1492
01:13:50,349 --> 01:13:51,160
uh...

1493
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,780
sued the differences are

1494
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:55,509
infinitely far behind

1495
01:13:55,510 --> 01:14:02,510
i'd as bad as you think windows servers
right this is far worse

1496
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:04,860
the use of the preferably

1497
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:09,268
of the into fifty trip they were pretty
much the they were actually trying

1498
01:14:09,269 --> 01:14:13,550
understand what was going wrong they
were great data already identified that

1499
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:14,909
problem themselves

1500
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:16,659
right on the email about it

1501
01:14:16,659 --> 01:14:17,879
uh...

1502
01:14:17,879 --> 01:14:19,849
they replied within an hour

1503
01:14:19,849 --> 01:14:20,820
customers

1504
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:22,789
antenna little bit

1505
01:14:22,789 --> 01:14:26,650
head and indeed he talked a bit of
communist or

1506
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:29,959
got did we ever talked about her and you
demonstrate that

1507
01:14:29,959 --> 01:14:31,929
you know or second

1508
01:14:31,929 --> 01:14:36,869
fight keen yeah but i was about time and
stop replying emails yet heard nearby at

1509
01:14:36,869 --> 01:14:37,389
all

1510
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:38,659
no

1511
01:14:38,659 --> 01:14:41,900
when i first came out that may have
heard nothing back saying no

1512
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:44,730
particularly people at the company a
sitting there listening

1513
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:48,379
this is your email address use the
republic

1514
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:49,889
uh... still nothing

1515
01:14:49,889 --> 01:14:53,290
society emailing all of

1516
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:54,840
friends who were

1517
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:58,489
customers at texas instruments as having
trouble getting in touch with the norway

1518
01:14:58,489 --> 01:15:00,499
office can you please

1519
01:15:00,499 --> 01:15:04,820
uh... amend within two hours at a
frantic email from germany

1520
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:09,549
saying that they were placed in his
about

1521
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:14,780
knights of the of course i mean a lot of
love obscured advertising depart for you

1522
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:18,329
will be nice if they had a significant
target for some help too

1523
01:15:18,329 --> 01:15:21,150
absolve authentication stuff like that
uh...

1524
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:25,309
from all that most of the problems with
the job that would mean all the problem

1525
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:27,030
they're not going

1526
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:28,869
capitan

1527
01:15:28,869 --> 01:15:35,188
it would help in cases where difficult
wording jester access that's cynthia's

1528
01:15:35,189 --> 01:15:36,940
district all of you for that night

1529
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:40,320
is an expert to help a lot even to give

1530
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,239
uh...

1531
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:44,049
it would help a lot because

1532
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:45,300
deserve

1533
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:49,989
the high cost attacking he's many
contracts u_p_s_ involving now and then

1534
01:15:49,989 --> 01:15:51,699
they get blown up and

1535
01:15:51,699 --> 01:15:53,889
uh...

1536
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:57,960
and disappear very important technology
land mines in the coming into his

1537
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,400
it's illegal by many international
treaties to use land mines that might

1538
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,348
stay around after the war is over

1539
01:16:03,349 --> 01:16:07,589
because they last for decades they
continue to kill children after decades

1540
01:16:07,589 --> 01:16:11,679
but with networks set of land mines
ukraine order them to self-destruct when

1541
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:13,709
the conflicts are

1542
01:16:13,709 --> 01:16:14,969
uh... you no longer

1543
01:16:14,969 --> 01:16:18,159
give a damn about holding that
particular area if you say okay

1544
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:20,339
all the blow up what we have no people
here

1545
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:23,820
and mary slaney recital

1546
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:24,840
begin

1547
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:27,869
help a lot of people

1548
01:16:27,869 --> 01:16:31,769
yes it's terribly inconvenient loads up
her leg

1549
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:33,519
character

1550
01:16:33,519 --> 01:16:35,159
bob bob

1551
01:16:35,159 --> 01:16:37,150
uh...

1552
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:41,070
do i mean or just in general i mean it
since this is sort of security any what

1553
01:16:41,070 --> 01:16:44,058
it but even in the basement
misconceptions when it comes the hard

1554
01:16:44,059 --> 01:16:46,769
work security

1555
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:49,900
they think a lot of suffered people
knows the

1556
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:54,480
common software problems to code on it
and you realize that people never check

1557
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,549
to see whether its size its positive or
negative

1558
01:16:57,550 --> 01:17:02,869
and they keep using unsigned values you
have integer frozen

1559
01:17:02,869 --> 01:17:07,759
uh... media recognize how vulnerable
much software is because you playing

1560
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,090
with it all

1561
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:12,889
and hardware sort of a consist black box
that you

1562
01:17:12,889 --> 01:17:17,610
don't play with c_ don't still where the
moral of the success

1563
01:17:17,610 --> 01:17:21,228
and you say that's insecure because
everything is in securing distances

1564
01:17:21,229 --> 01:17:22,340
world

1565
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:25,059
where would it be insecure why would it
be insecure

1566
01:17:25,059 --> 01:17:28,360
then you find yourself at a loss of even
if you're very good and software or you

1567
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,250
know

1568
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:32,510
sume bison equipment instead nasa

1569
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:35,820
uh... in fact about soon good fed courts
with me

1570
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:40,009
uh... text me after i got here and
compliment you

1571
01:17:40,010 --> 01:17:43,889
you can build your own and start
connecting teacher punch up the and

1572
01:17:43,889 --> 01:17:45,350
white kids memory out

1573
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:46,860
and uh...

1574
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:48,789
see the brown hasn't been addressed

1575
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:53,519
you can grab your thermostatic becuase i
would start talking your electric meter

1576
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,249
uh...

1577
01:17:54,249 --> 01:17:57,670
beginning to develop the fault is that
you get back to the island another trip

1578
01:17:57,670 --> 01:18:00,850
to the bottom

1579
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:02,450
now sets the limits by you

1580
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:04,148
the stuff we've done here

1581
01:18:04,149 --> 01:18:05,849
transfected

1582
01:18:05,849 --> 01:18:12,849
by any questions from the audience

1583
01:18:19,729 --> 01:18:20,719
i wasn't

1584
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:21,949
to question is

1585
01:18:21,949 --> 01:18:24,709
is this uh... trend in embedded systems
and

1586
01:18:24,709 --> 01:18:27,280
dustin on intention but

1587
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,999
where do they pay attention

1588
01:18:28,999 --> 01:18:30,210
now if you look

1589
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:34,550
we look at press suffer from multiple
vendors and indifferent areas

1590
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:37,570
knowing his attention until they get a
bottle

1591
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:41,789
now if you compare those security of
openoffice microsoft office microsoft

1592
01:18:41,789 --> 01:18:46,030
office is actually a lot more secure
because they actually take the time to

1593
01:18:46,030 --> 01:18:48,290
do first testing on their files

1594
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:53,750
they don't catch everything didn't do
anything gestion majority of things

1595
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:58,530
component of an officer workshop

1596
01:18:58,530 --> 01:18:59,629
and

1597
01:18:59,629 --> 01:19:05,459
no one is going to sit around and run
boring test cases and open office

1598
01:19:05,459 --> 01:19:07,179
women are getting paid to do it

1599
01:19:07,179 --> 01:19:08,699
the lab classic features

1600
01:19:08,699 --> 01:19:12,910
but let me know company will spend the
time making something secure

1601
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:15,830
until they see images which are not
sands in one of the oval office

1602
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:17,820
developers

1603
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:19,299
don't need to

1604
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:22,000
spent much time in the past and don't
need to

1605
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,750
uh... first has to make sure that all of
the file formats

1606
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:27,370
the

1607
01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:30,870
limited systems development still have
to live on

1608
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:33,979
and this is an industry that doesn't
have

1609
01:19:33,979 --> 01:19:37,849
the issues of complexity cpc so
criminalist

1610
01:19:37,849 --> 01:19:39,800
so you've been running a bit of software

1611
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,800
uh... very few

1612
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,539
embedded developers know about

1613
01:19:44,539 --> 01:19:46,949
version control

1614
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:51,330
uh... by the friend who sent uh...
defile

1615
01:19:51,330 --> 01:19:52,979
might delivered

1616
01:19:52,979 --> 01:19:57,580
and saying hey we found a bug was fixed
it appears the patch

1617
01:19:57,580 --> 01:20:02,210
and reply was let's catch

1618
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:04,590
susan to go for it

1619
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:07,880
uh... beginning to look for the search
their own internal

1620
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:12,130
records and they found this version of
patra sixteen-bit darts

1621
01:20:12,130 --> 01:20:16,190
which wasn't quite compatible with the
new infringed

1622
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:17,369
uh...

1623
01:20:17,369 --> 01:20:20,000
usually the shuttle's about mark for

1624
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,099
and that's

1625
01:20:21,099 --> 01:20:21,960
standard

1626
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:24,250
if you need to support two different
programs

1627
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:28,769
right now i'm looking at the reference
implementations retreat activity art

1628
01:20:28,769 --> 01:20:31,669
enough money my own members before
thirty two murder

1629
01:20:31,669 --> 01:20:35,500
and be has four kids every time they
have a new job come out so they have

1630
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,060
four different forks

1631
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:38,409
of the jet lag time

1632
01:20:38,409 --> 01:20:40,558
just to program a chat

1633
01:20:40,559 --> 01:20:45,200
that yest uh... you know my quickly will
go through regarded uh...

1634
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:48,929
know you're you're able breeze

1635
01:20:48,929 --> 01:20:51,550
but you know production babies

1636
01:20:51,550 --> 01:20:54,760
usually you you one

1637
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,489
tour and by

1638
01:20:56,489 --> 01:21:00,330
appreciation protected by

1639
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:01,939
it

1640
01:21:01,939 --> 01:21:06,159
is review race for me right only

1641
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:09,750
camp but they're very good reasons why
people dot

1642
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:13,429
uh... if you do this then it becomes
harder to

1643
01:21:13,429 --> 01:21:16,709
plagiarism product it's harder to
recruit out and shove it into another

1644
01:21:16,709 --> 01:21:19,260
chip it's harder to do those sorts of
things

1645
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:22,639
but what happens if you manufacture ten
thousand vices

1646
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:26,119
and then you discover that none of them
work

1647
01:21:26,119 --> 01:21:31,509
because of the body need to patch but
you're locked out from the j charges

1648
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:38,149
uh... the area blood requested
reasonable cable

1649
01:21:38,149 --> 01:21:44,159
there and you're didn't uses the word
best suited to try to use is used to

1650
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:45,790
disable the access

1651
01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:50,050
wyrm different judges and wanted to be
returned where simply steel drums before

1652
01:21:50,050 --> 01:21:52,010
thirties one simple that fuse

1653
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:53,800
you can never repair

1654
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:56,929
as a regular develop if you own a
chemistry lab anew

1655
01:21:56,929 --> 01:22:01,999
chip uh... hold the glass and scored a
goal of american repair but

1656
01:22:01,999 --> 01:22:06,579
uh... it's nothing you can join in the
summertime

1657
01:22:06,579 --> 01:22:12,679
they have the polluter as a backup nafta
silicon many trips where treated fuse is

1658
01:22:12,679 --> 01:22:15,000
blown and there's a bunch of your screen

1659
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:19,859
on the t aj of seeking connects sure
serial port beaten program about what

1660
01:22:19,859 --> 01:22:25,079
to repair production line uh... them
problems are that this has its own

1661
01:22:25,079 --> 01:22:25,849
inches

1662
01:22:25,849 --> 01:22:30,199
so now you wind up being vulnerable give
by their trade headquarter bootloader

1663
01:22:30,199 --> 01:22:31,659
has about them

1664
01:22:31,659 --> 01:22:33,808
and also did

1665
01:22:33,809 --> 01:22:36,820
permafrost lonely supported pat

1666
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:40,340
they won't support reflection boards by
the voters who were not getting all the

1667
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:44,030
interns in your company to sit and do it
moves on the line reprogramming trooper

1668
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:45,320
problem

1669
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,880
but if you can find the problem

1670
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:51,139
do you do that you're not able to do
debugging you can't watch registering

1671
01:22:51,139 --> 01:22:52,429
blacks in the stock

1672
01:22:52,429 --> 01:22:56,249
securing not want something doesn't work
consist of

1673
01:22:56,249 --> 01:22:57,478
and uh...

1674
01:22:57,479 --> 01:22:59,610
also this security

1675
01:22:59,610 --> 01:23:01,380
features of the boot loader

1676
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,060
arteries all classroom

1677
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:05,739
just like the japan trip

1678
01:23:05,739 --> 01:23:11,648
but part of flash memory contains the
valleys made tutoring manufacturing of

1679
01:23:11,649 --> 01:23:13,050
the chip to tell you

1680
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:14,649
what

1681
01:23:14,649 --> 01:23:18,149
uh... set the clock registers to to run
in a particular frequency

1682
01:23:18,149 --> 01:23:20,719
so if you can add to the bootloader you
blow that away and then you have to

1683
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:23,969
patching hardware reports by having a
crystal

1684
01:23:23,969 --> 01:23:28,439
any all of these headaches buying
nothing as the average develop

1685
01:23:28,439 --> 01:23:33,570
yes they make you more secure
development the summer midgets

1686
01:23:33,570 --> 01:23:37,809
uh... and even really wants a copy of
your from where two pledge as a product

1687
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:40,510
kicking it anyways by other methods

1688
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:42,940
thereabouts you can go to and u

1689
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:46,509
plop down uh... couple hundred dollars
local thousand dollars in the high and

1690
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:47,389
and

1691
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:49,980
the comeback in a week with copy to come

1692
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:51,629
miss one independent

1693
01:23:51,629 --> 01:23:52,470
so

1694
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:54,699
yes it can be done but there's no

1695
01:23:54,699 --> 01:24:00,549
but it was there isn't enough economic
incentive to do it

1696
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:04,599
any other questions

1697
01:24:04,599 --> 01:24:08,229
alone or explode patient you mentioned

1698
01:24:08,229 --> 01:24:13,850
them first

1699
01:24:13,850 --> 01:24:16,110
and

1700
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:18,929
and before here

1701
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:20,179
sterile

1702
01:24:20,179 --> 01:24:22,590
uh... initially they were very many

1703
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:23,820
networking protocols

1704
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:27,420
forward these church to the chip itself
would be an issue dot fifteen dot four

1705
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:28,769
contract

1706
01:24:28,769 --> 01:24:32,780
uh... all that describes how to get a
one hundred and twenty eight nine

1707
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:37,699
datagram from one trip to another it
doesn't describe win the radius should

1708
01:24:37,699 --> 01:24:39,089
be listening

1709
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:41,589
in order for this technology work you
have to do

1710
01:24:41,589 --> 01:24:44,919
stopped listening for most of the time
so

1711
01:24:44,919 --> 01:24:49,070
uh... wondered will tell another two
expect in extracted

1712
01:24:49,070 --> 01:24:51,320
and stinging nettle

1713
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:55,259
in ninety six seconds diverted one
second

1714
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:59,849
and then the receiving chip will turn on
the holy for that window of time

1715
01:24:59,849 --> 01:25:03,679
because receiving a packet costs more
and then

1716
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:05,219
transmitting a packet

1717
01:25:05,219 --> 01:25:06,849
much more

1718
01:25:06,849 --> 01:25:11,179
if you try to make these things are
efficient use and uh... a packet

1719
01:25:11,179 --> 01:25:14,399
at the earliest time they expect
recipient together and maybe ill send it

1720
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:15,390
twice

1721
01:25:15,390 --> 01:25:19,030
because if he spends four seconds
waiting for your package common doesn't

1722
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:20,559
come

1723
01:25:20,559 --> 01:25:25,369
back actually cost more power than your
flooding the network for four seconds

1724
01:25:25,369 --> 01:25:26,730
uh... and

1725
01:25:26,730 --> 01:25:30,389
there aren't very good models for how
much you worked for different from the

1726
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:31,690
scene overcome

1727
01:25:31,690 --> 01:25:34,870
uh... t_c_ peery control and things like
that

1728
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:36,099
are

1729
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:41,070
irrelevant industry not because of all
the changes have happened

1730
01:25:41,070 --> 01:25:44,039
dues report in time women

1731
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:47,500
lots of different competing companies
decided that they were going to create

1732
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,610
v networking standard for this

1733
01:25:49,610 --> 01:25:52,349
you had six look on which is not bb six

1734
01:25:52,350 --> 01:25:53,550
implementation

1735
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:58,460
there's also zigbee which goes as high
as the application lastly unspecified

1736
01:25:58,460 --> 01:26:00,899
how you can turn a corner spot

1737
01:26:00,899 --> 01:26:03,570
two different sounds and things like
that

1738
01:26:03,570 --> 01:26:06,980
you also had a bias a one hundred and
wireless heart

1739
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:10,858
which are used for uh... industrial
control

1740
01:26:10,859 --> 01:26:12,590
to try to run a factory

1741
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:16,690
you'll use i say one hundred instead is
it me because i as a one hundred is

1742
01:26:16,690 --> 01:26:20,369
compatible with all of the scapegoat
into using within that factory

1743
01:26:20,369 --> 01:26:23,209
were wanting to see you know things like
that

1744
01:26:23,209 --> 01:26:26,749
sue you have drastically different
networking standards

1745
01:26:26,749 --> 01:26:30,269
all using the same physically

1746
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:33,750
that's why there's such a difference
because

1747
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:36,710
decent having its own personal protocol

1748
01:26:36,710 --> 01:26:40,790
similar to how we were in nineteen
ninety three did nineteen ninety five

1749
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:43,760
before tease you get the one ab

1750
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:48,400
when every team game he had never play
would have but you choose between

1751
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:54,920
and direct dialogue or i'll get out of
the acts of use of the idea

1752
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:57,909
these things haven't settled yet

1753
01:26:57,909 --> 01:26:59,688
deb thank you

1754
01:26:59,689 --> 01:27:04,510
uh... militarist questions or madam

1755
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:11,510
they could write a report to catch

1756
01:27:14,129 --> 01:27:16,969
experts

1757
01:27:16,969 --> 01:27:20,659
whose when hypocritical slides

1758
01:27:20,659 --> 01:27:23,829
i think we're moving into a copy of
right now

1759
01:27:23,829 --> 01:27:27,719
solar-powered are operating out

1760
01:27:27,719 --> 01:27:30,769
the water foreign currency exchange

1761
01:27:30,769 --> 01:27:34,639
program planning judge

1762
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:35,109
on time
