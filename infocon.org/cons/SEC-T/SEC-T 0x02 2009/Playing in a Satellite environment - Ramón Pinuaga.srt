357
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,620
so who produces very soon

358
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,080
you need to to to indicate dot

359
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,040
for lacking we've got that

360
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,939
but we see

361
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,090
there are different kinds of it's we are
only ten thirty p_m_ into peace

362
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,710
but carry that out

363
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:40,120
on create a definite of race

364
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,600
period

365
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,860
they

366
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,120
they

367
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,989
that that

368
00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:48,990
and i hated it usually fix it

369
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:54,120
indicates david divided the brave ideal
platform that

370
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,920
meeting

371
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,610
but maybe the date that once i'll fix it

372
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,150
we try and research internet did

373
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,040
the average for the perfect place for
them

374
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,530
computed

375
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:10,839
computer outerwear unity track two

376
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,970
if for example

377
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:18,010
for betty via satellite

378
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,560
we do if you're gonna the lyrics to

379
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,339
pitcher in the second

380
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,520
without

381
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,799
receiving the information

382
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,179
legendary from here

383
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:37,270
what immigration is is finding would say
that the point that it be the repeat we

384
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,210
aren't there

385
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,640
weekend it would be to dvd s no

386
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,740
with the spirit and

387
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,120
use an example

388
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:54,120
what we've seen

389
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:05,920
but

390
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,570
we caught your winter facing the labels

391
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:17,379
for b speed run

392
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,310
who start smoking

393
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,340
gave one of the problem week for
collecting

394
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,289
it

395
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:24,990
involving is

396
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,240
repack

397
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,210
c

398
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,159
basically uh... repatriate though

399
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:32,700
of buckets

400
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,010
this is because if they were you recieve
they won't

401
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,370
traffic from

402
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,100
yet but dot b

403
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,990
that these religious views

404
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,330
he said they really

405
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,010
play great off

406
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,169
but with

407
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,220
refile from all that the ccs

408
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,500
it's easy to

409
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,540
to his nickname

410
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,530
for example if you would see that

411
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,800
so mr d appalled

412
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,090
proc

413
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:09,090
yuki

414
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,049
or

415
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:21,240
are not any

416
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,640
increased that's all

417
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,309
we can get p

418
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:30,760
we can get by the long weekend get
groupies reading mats from other people

419
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,950
they

420
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:36,680
cuts into the players traffic and i
think

421
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,669
but i think we seen

422
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:42,880
he's been talking about it for about the
poll that you would be

423
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,100
the internet

424
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,310
but destroyed by proponents of the left

425
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:54,149
so this is that

426
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,669
the we must remember

427
00:19:56,669 --> 00:19:57,630
when

428
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,170
configured about

429
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:04,030
the

430
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,149
that means that

431
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,570
that i have to be part of the product

432
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,309
football

433
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,629
well

434
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,570
d

435
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,899
while

436
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:16,379
he's like the or

437
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,070
when we see despite we only

438
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,550
it with the only chuck

439
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,060
the thinks about the people are going on

440
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,928
we can see that by defense

441
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:31,820
indication about the bombing

442
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,760
where minority are

443
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,410
by satellite

444
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,240
skimpy situation

445
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
we have to find

446
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,260
d

447
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,299
bottling b

448
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,040
before he's different from that

449
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,490
and what the

450
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,340
u_p_

451
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,480
so we have to his knees to

452
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,550
different connection and then

453
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,810
weeks to go back to get the being

454
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,620
day more protection

455
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,209
but didn't they

456
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,220
the

457
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:06,220
the most commonly used or leadership
that you know in the land

458
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,490
orwell's the first thought that his

459
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,560
as anything that these

460
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,750
more or less

461
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,880
the you see

462
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,280
these kind of attacks are

463
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,770
uh... being

464
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,910

nobody has commented before

471
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,720
the possibility

472
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,040
of making attacks

473
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,700

from here

489
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,180
these attacks more effective

490
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,990
for example

this information is enough to too

535
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,340
to carry on our commitment that

00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,009
we've information update

537
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:53,539
well the first backing

538
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:55,549
we know

539
00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:58,440
sequence on the site of the public
funding

540
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,279
from jane depicting

542
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,439
you see now

543
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:10,160
to aren't week i think that the
connection

544
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,530
on conduct the traffic from the from
uh... you said that

545
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:18,678
disconnected from what's important

546
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,280
more about possible bones of the
question

547
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,670
came attacking it great

548
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:29,899
grants out you know a critic of solution

549
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:32,300

security mission refused

556
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:48,870
be is simply a uh... i think it's a
leading political

557
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,879
so on

558
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,100
the topic is the simply use integrated
trees

559
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:00,709
you up proper connection

560
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,330

which pop

598
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,520

the response

603
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,050
because of the uh... hungry connections
to

604
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,610
it to our

605
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,459
to agree

606
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,160

simply work but you're not going to see
if you've been responsive

610
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:55,610
so

611
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,600
without done com

612
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,379

umbrella taps

614
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:03,279
maybe so

615
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,890

618
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:10,729
of doing this

619
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,680
week on

620
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,180
make that connection to loose acts

diego light wasn't bad

622
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:20,429
uh...

623
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:24,980
red being response is missing from the
satellite

624
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,080
so

625
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,020
usual comm we use

626
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,920
these kind of connection u

627
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,890
the

00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,419
making more

00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:37,159
talking about

he knew need various is falsely linking

bought these techniques

672
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,100
toughly some problems and we can

673
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,340
with something from tracking

know whether it's almost all were
comparable about pretty mechanism

took a lot and satellite

698
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:51,940
we kept seeing

699
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,550
we've discussed between being

700
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:00,690

00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:07,690
uh... collect them

702
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:22,470

these pieces are use possibly spicy

704
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:35,200
use on the dismissing a traffic

705
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,010
this is what you for offering to
invading

706
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,810
dent in that

707
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,529

709
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,420
you seemed of

710
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,309
we human beings have more than

711
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:55,030

714
00:33:59,109 --> 00:34:04,000
so it's almost impossible to trace

715
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,000
they the all going back

716
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:16,429

00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:45,139
on treatment

790
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:48,499
patriarchy santa barbara he said

receded

794
00:38:00,649 --> 00:38:04,729
but something like that

795
00:38:04,729 --> 00:38:09,538
we actually got pacified like the others
for frequently don't being

796
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:11,809
anything to me

appreciate what the court

800
00:38:19,189 --> 00:38:20,000
ye

801
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,259
you know it out

802
00:38:21,259 --> 00:38:22,979
he's fussy

i'll celebrate my birthday because
enough coffee

808
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:39,299
idea we'll see

809
00:38:39,299 --> 00:38:46,299
uh... idealist corresponding to the exit
early believes that america braun

810
00:38:47,239 --> 00:38:48,179
so

811
00:38:48,179 --> 00:38:51,409
this is uh... uh... very hard to trace
connection

812
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:54,949
uh... free

813
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:57,139
the

814
00:38:57,139 --> 00:39:00,829
so we see some

815
00:39:00,829 --> 00:39:02,489
the conclusion of

816
00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:07,979
the

817
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:09,220
you where the are

818
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,689
made forget they are doing scenario

819
00:39:12,689 --> 00:39:16,899
pieces that i don't use innovative
supply for for reaching talking on it

820
00:39:16,899 --> 00:39:20,259
but there are

821
00:39:20,259 --> 00:39:21,549
week but my mother

822
00:39:21,549 --> 00:39:24,899
we've got a good thing

823
00:39:24,899 --> 00:39:29,549
bob hope loving using data dot com

824
00:39:29,549 --> 00:39:31,989
bluffs associated eight d

825
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:33,229
the country's

826
00:39:33,229 --> 00:39:37,218
uses more space

827
00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:38,230
so

828
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,809
computers

829
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:45,729
subtle application are insecure but i
think

830
00:39:45,729 --> 00:39:47,629
uh... earlier

831
00:39:47,629 --> 00:39:50,058
base it on to the light

832
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:52,099
insecure because

833
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:53,599
itpro

834
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,569
economies the effect

835
00:39:58,569 --> 00:40:00,749
about

836
00:40:00,749 --> 00:40:05,819
but that's probably not

837
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:08,589
they must either what this is not

838
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:11,979
talking about the trustees

839
00:40:11,979 --> 00:40:14,288
unsecured

840
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:16,080
but not the

841
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,669
we got a spry despite securities do

842
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:23,308
we make the odds are single connection

843
00:40:23,309 --> 00:40:25,159
so

844
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:28,649
t

845
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:33,759

sathi year mind

847
00:40:36,899 --> 00:40:40,439
i think you're much firmer now does that
seem very interesting comment

848
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:43,299
one of those things that most people do
want out

849
00:40:43,299 --> 00:40:46,890
at some point writer massive satellite

throughout the day as a result in a
sense that you could go out and i didn't

866
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:36,489
know i don't know it's all the entire
let's turn our amenities receives your

there are any of

00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:45,199
we'll beat that

00:41:49,819 --> 00:41:50,579
what what

875
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:51,930
uh...

876
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:55,399
the but there are a lot

877
00:41:55,399 --> 00:41:58,519
uh... and then when you scripting
summing up what what kind of such

878
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:00,999
networks do you find that kind of thing

879
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:04,839
public i_p_ other strange is to find
behind these things you're

880
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:07,609
were you saw the traffic problem

881
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:10,419
companies that are a superstar in

882
00:42:10,419 --> 00:42:13,538
in-country organizing that

883
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:15,399
they

884
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:18,269
the site that are any

885
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:22,279
hard to get done from their internet
connection

886
00:42:22,279 --> 00:42:24,140
become unlisted

887
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,828
boomer demands

888
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:29,859
uh...

889
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:34,239
okay about questions from the audience
at home issuing a first you don't have a

890
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:35,249
microphone

891
00:42:35,249 --> 00:42:39,689
kalui ke picked them up from behind you
everybody microphone by the way and

892
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,059
they're supposed to work

893
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,469
uh... yet

894
00:42:42,469 --> 00:42:46,829
they way we deduce that the attack on
what your the date uh... do you think is

895
00:42:46,829 --> 00:42:50,289
actually pretty versus uninterested if
you take out like

896
00:42:50,289 --> 00:42:52,549
jerry and expected

897
00:42:52,549 --> 00:42:53,720
the

898
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,959
are mostly naked but then a season in
cricket

899
00:42:57,959 --> 00:43:00,490
the trafficking dead

900
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:05,098
the prorated that included a picture of
the few

901
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:09,109
so it was basically you'd think people
are looking to do so it would be a

902
00:43:09,109 --> 00:43:12,459
private network and therefore do not
think repair traffic

903
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:15,439
alot of people and that we can see

904
00:43:15,439 --> 00:43:18,348
if you do not address the issues that
for a period

905
00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:19,249
the peace

906
00:43:19,249 --> 00:43:21,009
uic usually

907
00:43:21,009 --> 00:43:22,329
they

908
00:43:22,329 --> 00:43:24,210
use it for

909
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,719
for probably mentors

910
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:29,760
and most people think that satellite are

911
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,319
yet closed-loop ned wharton out t

912
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:38,029
it's sent to you

913
00:43:38,029 --> 00:43:42,129
uh...

914
00:43:42,129 --> 00:43:49,129
fed-up harmony ice bouston that's been
been awaiting you and spooked market

915
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,269
they

916
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:52,348
do

917
00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:55,649
where we expect and what do

918
00:43:55,649 --> 00:43:58,038
we think that most unit

919
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:01,939
orchestra later are detain exported but
but

920
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:05,709
in almost a year fifty percent of the
n_t_s_b_

921
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:09,799
politeness and they will we need to fit
but

922
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,009
welcome but

923
00:44:12,009 --> 00:44:14,149
deliveries for you

924
00:44:14,149 --> 00:44:17,939
by dr

925
00:44:17,939 --> 00:44:19,729
you have any more questions from

926
00:44:19,729 --> 00:44:25,209
the audience

927
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:27,319
are totally

928
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:28,969
because it's all else and talk

929
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:30,639
uh... truly exciting stuff

930
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:31,999
and i'm

931
00:44:31,999 --> 00:44:36,879
certain you know you're talking about
smoking packets like sending them out

932
00:44:36,879 --> 00:44:42,328
eyes pedido like to dress makers
filtering properly

933
00:44:42,329 --> 00:44:45,419
that seems like a pretty straightforward
with you

934
00:44:45,419 --> 00:44:46,910
why

935
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:49,879
use the

936
00:44:49,879 --> 00:44:54,029
why not actually just send the signals
to the satellite directly

937
00:44:54,029 --> 00:44:57,419
uh... like for example um... there were
so

938
00:44:57,419 --> 00:45:00,219
uh... falun gong protesters that
hijacked the chinese day television

939
00:45:00,219 --> 00:45:03,619
driving across the desert

940
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:06,089
and they were able to broadcast to the
signal

941
00:45:06,089 --> 00:45:09,459
uh... to the repeater and they were able
to take over the entire television

942
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:10,219
network

943
00:45:10,219 --> 00:45:12,419
for the chinese to television

944
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:17,098
why not tried to do similar attacks and
then not use any

945
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:22,259
internet i'd also be basically chris
boyd to the broadcast location

946
00:45:22,259 --> 00:45:25,839
wastes focuses on on network acts

947
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:29,649
the u_c_l_a_ precipitation for example
the world

948
00:45:29,649 --> 00:45:30,959
period

949
00:45:30,959 --> 00:45:33,939
dot then did the russian guys

950
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:38,149
year distribution is more ole reduces
collision morrow pockets of political

951
00:45:38,149 --> 00:45:39,709
like yourself

952
00:45:39,709 --> 00:45:41,419
but the network going from that

953
00:45:41,419 --> 00:45:43,368
what's what's the plan

954
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:47,349
the respect of from people to talk about
the

955
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:49,619
you sort of a disciple i took off

956
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:52,239
it's a good look at some of the problems

957
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:56,249
this kind of perfect

958
00:45:56,249 --> 00:46:00,689
but there there are some old people
these attacks are possible

959
00:46:00,689 --> 00:46:05,519
but we we focus on your network
lexington internet needs to look at

960
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:07,308
the group

961
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:10,149
these networks

962
00:46:10,149 --> 00:46:12,808
that if you can sniff it

963
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:17,199
there is an occasion as all like you
know homebrew made up stuff

964
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:20,359
basically they just have to do a blatant
use of the change some including an

965
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:25,169
expert in t_v_ g_d_p_ step at rather
edges of actual satellite network an

966
00:46:25,169 --> 00:46:29,209
actual tablet stuff is all black box
which means it's probably all crap

967
00:46:29,209 --> 00:46:33,379
you can probably just sent if you have a
look at the new radio you could probably

968
00:46:33,379 --> 00:46:36,999
build your own satellite transmitter and
then you could

969
00:46:36,999 --> 00:46:38,328
forecasts

970
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:39,909
what you could step toward

971
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:43,039
and then you can inject whatever package
he wanted and as long as when it gets to

972
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:46,239
the satellite the satellite is getting
it on the same spot being then you

973
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:47,729
should

974
00:46:47,729 --> 00:46:49,989
i guess maybe

975
00:46:49,989 --> 00:46:54,569
over you know the satellite loneliness
per what i think that some some attacks

976
00:46:54,569 --> 00:46:55,589
are possible

977
00:46:55,589 --> 00:46:59,259
there there are a lot of recess

978
00:46:59,259 --> 00:47:03,379
indies in these socked in these fields

979
00:47:03,379 --> 00:47:09,879
william the pollution on network dot

980
00:47:09,879 --> 00:47:14,259
at any more questions have a question
here

981
00:47:14,259 --> 00:47:15,219
uh...

982
00:47:15,219 --> 00:47:22,219
the slope or counter-suit using certain
late connections to sumner steeple more

983
00:47:24,589 --> 00:47:29,269
phone communication for the to an into
the country have you

984
00:47:29,269 --> 00:47:34,089
gain an act of two belt type of channels

985
00:47:34,089 --> 00:47:35,419
uh... n

986
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:37,879
and focus on the internet commissioned
in

987
00:47:37,879 --> 00:47:41,229
default on the case showing divided
mitigation

988
00:47:41,229 --> 00:47:43,489
hardly know that these

989
00:47:43,489 --> 00:47:46,899
on another extremes

990
00:47:46,899 --> 00:47:51,259
they haven't that's in your view

991
00:47:51,259 --> 00:47:55,220
usually she'd be able to log onto the
other day districts is going up

992
00:47:55,220 --> 00:48:01,129
disclosure dandelion could sadat daram

993
00:48:01,129 --> 00:48:02,058
this unique

994
00:48:02,059 --> 00:48:04,519
like disney these resistance

995
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:07,959
by happened he

996
00:48:07,959 --> 00:48:09,720
working a lot

997
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,339
is more

998
00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:13,000
more property and these

999
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:20,000
was u

1000
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:24,849
any more questions

1001
00:48:24,849 --> 00:48:28,499
you'll be here today but not dumas rang

1002
00:48:28,499 --> 00:48:29,959
so if there's a

1003
00:48:29,959 --> 00:48:31,808
your you're leaving tomorrow

1004

uh... so we've got like

1013
00:49:29,769 --> 00:49:32,718
twenty minutes uh... half an hour

1014
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:37,059
you beyond just stretch your legs to
whatever have a look at the uh... stuff

1015
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:38,739
happening in the small room

1016
00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:42,069
which i won't name and uh...

1017
00:49:42,069 --> 00:49:45,839
do you have anything to add to list

1018
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,828
okay so feel free to mingle around and
talk to people and do whatever until

1019
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:51,109
lunch

1020
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:56,499
i will also be uh... interviews uh...
with the air the speakers happening in

1021
00:49:56,499 --> 00:49:58,919
the smaller room so we will not

1022
00:49:58,919 --> 00:50:03,638
how the few wicked cameras there and
uh... desert questions and answers with

1023
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:07,379
the speakers right now situate watch
that you can come there as well
