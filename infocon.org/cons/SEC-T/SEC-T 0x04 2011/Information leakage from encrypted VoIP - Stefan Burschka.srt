00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,430
so

188
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:25,430
reform physics

189
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,320
but it is the first

190
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,040
the holes

191
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:35,790
so on

192
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,280
differentiated probably

193
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,500

194
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,760
he case

195
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,189
it also

196
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,390
and weekends

197
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,490
just a moment

198
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,150

206
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:12,430

that's the only wiki

212
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:46,890

247
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,880
also among

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,930
these fields

being

251
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,870
if we can start are

252
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:56,870
cyclicals

253
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,210
diversity light actually

254

261
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:27,309
so let's see

266
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:45,320
a restless

267
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:51,760
sought me out

268
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,220

269
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,680
greatest on it

270
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,450
somewhat will suffer

271
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,659

274
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,690
but doesn't change

275
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,700
this heinous

276
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,890
are basically

277
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,000
ko

278
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,960

selena claims

280
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,250
so these are the issues

281
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,159
colossal

282
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,630
adults

283
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:50,010
each either

284
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:57,010
kitty

285
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,649
it's there

286
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,230
between the morning

287
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,970
you're speaking to cd

288
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,140
yes

289
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,280
do you also

290
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:14,559
finding defeated

291
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:21,559
it's already shows

292
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,020
texas

293
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:27,540
do you know

294
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,480
so we are all of this

295
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:37,390
just install

296
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,720
models

297
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,790
opt out of a second

298
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,070
so uh... if they don't work image of you

299
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,889
or whatever

300
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,540
blackhawks

301
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,170
hero is

302
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,890
fruit ccs alzheimer's

303
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:57,070
no words you use of these

304
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:03,408
political words

305
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:04,840
so uh... that would be

306
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,030
nissan has released only to

307
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,330
poses for it

308
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,480
so

309
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,850
recital everybody

310
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:19,199
acronyms for us

311
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,120
out so they don't pay taxes

312
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,129
investor who can sit there who has a
three ac

313
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,010
understanding what you meant

314
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:33,600
who don't use

315
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,969
keepers if you don't need you to go

316
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,140
parties involved

317
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,850
expert

318
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,669
and that means

319
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,679
after draws near the bodies

320
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,660
excuses

321
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:53,150
but what so we don't stalk you

322
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,050
so mr

323
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,620
to laos

324
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,850
eventually

325
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,050
next fire

326
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:08,050
absorbance

327
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,500
if you're looking for a while

328
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:18,500
what it is the internet

329
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,899
escrow

330
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,120
so when she is itself

331
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,489
films

332
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:35,490
ended

333
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,710
remedy

334
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:46,710
ec movement because they see

335
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,980
what we want to do something on the

336
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:55,130
signals as a woman who cares

337
00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:01,030
you can say is interesting

338
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,309
we figured out there dot

339
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:07,090
for rentals school

340
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:10,010
david hughes factually

341
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,670
faris

342
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:17,860
both breast and software

343
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:21,379
so it looks like they're destroyed

344
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,340
fantasy

345
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,419
again

346
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,420
consistently

347
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,539
it's all a player

348
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:32,289
rearrested

349
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:33,780
americans

350
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,700
character issue

351
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,250
some pictures

352
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,190
occassional meal all three days

353
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:41,980
reappears

354
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,880
and possibly pc

355
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,490
that resulted in frequency

356
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:53,600
expressly parts of the system

357
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,100
but are

358
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,969
so that was one of these

359
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,840
what gave up the issue

360
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,369
ghosts all this

361
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:03,760
all interesting

362
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,980
adolescence

363
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,870
missiles

364
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,979
piano

365
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,060
but usually yes

366
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,500
roses

367
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,020
so this will give you the other

so much

574
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:19,059
there was some talk

575
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:24,959
we think there are pieces

576
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:25,879

606
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:21,279
we could say

607
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:27,949
assumptions away except

608
00:38:27,949 --> 00:38:30,369
these sentences

609
00:38:30,369 --> 00:38:31,869

612
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:43,678
funerals

613
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:45,889

00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:18,009
distasteful and see

622
00:39:18,009 --> 00:39:19,729
disabling

623
00:39:19,729 --> 00:39:26,729

creating requirements yeah

626
00:39:39,069 --> 00:39:40,729
the state

627
00:39:40,729 --> 00:39:43,180

631
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:55,749
so i'd lot of people here

632
00:39:55,749 --> 00:40:00,718

633
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:05,929

eight months ago

636
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:15,019
so imagine

637
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:17,468
was used at all

638
00:40:17,469 --> 00:40:21,779
radar signals

639

641
00:40:27,819 --> 00:40:29,569
but the xd

soviet reliable garcetti's square

643
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:37,288
ebbehout

644
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:39,129
cheapest-ever

645
00:40:39,129 --> 00:40:44,409

646
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:47,589

the army's yesterday she taught us
sometime

653
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:16,339
so interest

654
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:17,849
so that you see

655
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:20,739
ec speakers

656
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:25,039

657
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:25,899
so little

658
00:41:25,899 --> 00:41:28,479
lovely

659
00:41:28,479 --> 00:41:29,779

666
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:58,609
fall interest

667
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:08,519
most successful

668
00:42:11,179 --> 00:42:13,720

applications

673
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:32,269
we can actually

674

cell

675
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:35,189
why does not

676
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:42,190
because this is faulty alex all

677
00:42:46,469 --> 00:42:49,459
whose mother is

678
00:42:49,459 --> 00:42:50,719

679
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:55,199
it

680
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:58,439

he was not

691
00:43:43,819 --> 00:43:45,579
we could have happened

692
00:43:45,579 --> 00:43:48,819
usually count function

693
00:43:48,819 --> 00:43:52,649
computers

694
00:43:52,649 --> 00:43:54,189
would be a great fix

695
00:43:54,189 --> 00:43:58,709
but i would be

696
00:43:58,709 --> 00:44:05,709
suspended does

697
00:44:16,679 --> 00:44:17,640
it yes

698
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,649
issue he tossed i can guess

699
00:44:20,649 --> 00:44:23,299
response on the way

700
00:44:23,299 --> 00:44:28,660
i faxed the institute director moderate

701
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:33,769
finance fear it helps the six it work

702
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:37,589
we figure something out

703
00:44:37,589 --> 00:44:42,359
who's not

704
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:44,629
around eleven

705
00:44:44,629 --> 00:44:46,769
acts all process

706
00:44:46,769 --> 00:44:48,328
needs to be important

707
00:44:48,329 --> 00:44:52,339
this is all

708
00:44:52,339 --> 00:44:53,969
in this instance

709
00:44:53,969 --> 00:44:57,079
if you would consider

710
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:59,989
his classes

711
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:01,889
fantabulous

experiments and rehearsing

713
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:10,329
so the problems

714
00:45:10,329 --> 00:45:12,330
detection off-center the cease-fire

715
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,900

congo

720
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:27,199
is still a sort of

721
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:28,899
residential area

722
00:45:28,899 --> 00:45:33,629

it's not like that

728
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,150
we lose some hope

729
00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:00,829
risk taking all of this

730
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:02,199
to last

731
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:04,519

742
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:32,299

743
00:46:32,299 --> 00:46:35,389
alternate contact

744
00:46:35,389 --> 00:46:40,009
remains pretty safe

745
00:46:40,009 --> 00:46:47,009
the legacy
