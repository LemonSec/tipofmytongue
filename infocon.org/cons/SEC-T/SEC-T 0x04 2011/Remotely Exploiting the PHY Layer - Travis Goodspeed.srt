acceded sa

461
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,559
here's the issue

462
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:52,930
b_r_c_a_

463
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,740

464
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,920
without having a glance

465
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,649
and he still trees rocks

466
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:02,429
it's all about

467
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:07,360
but he did receive your words

468
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,500
dispatch

469
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:13,800
breaking

470
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,840
we detect

471
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,429
predictable ccc suburbs for jack

472
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:23,670
tease readings we take that

473
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,790
we ask

works in ohio

475
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:31,179
several of those work

476
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:34,510
it because

477
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,850
latest even

478
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:40,020

479
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,900
eroticism hahahahahaha

480
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,080
allowed several

481
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:53,080
but it will last

482
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:03,160
contracts the

483
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,540
organisms

484
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:11,540
and uh... those on the inside

485
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,520
you know that you are

486
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,889
examples of this error

487
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:17,600
it

488
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,750
if you get out

489
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,760
odd about

490
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,840
there's a lot of stuff

491
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:30,840
he

492
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,370
st louis farrakhan

493
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:36,939
much higher

494
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:43,300
how do you know and outside

495
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:50,159
i hit us

496
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,910
how did he work both ways

497
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:55,519
qualities you would like

498
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:02,519
that's it

499
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:09,240
we have cctv has also

500
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,190
the issue

terrorist act

502
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:16,029
unisons you'd kind of outside

503
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:19,530
important reason

504
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:26,530
your networks are really would like

505
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:32,070
and the syntax

506
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,570
right afterward

507
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,450

he glared at him not to sell

510
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,800
only worth looking at

511
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,990
it's unusual

512
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:49,789
asterix

513
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:56,789
this is an outrage

514
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:00,870
repairs

515
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,000

awasthi

517
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,448
there are five

hoppy easter

519
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,990
and we can get

520
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,630
starts

521

525
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,490
plus

526
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,429
retreats

527
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:37,710
at the same time they're taking
advantage

528
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,570
renting it out

529
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:45,570
stating the sentencing

530
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,099
it would be possible

531
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:49,158
he

532
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:50,269
bother

products

534
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:55,980
programs and software functions together

535
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,000
composing what's this

536
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,179
honestly don't understand

537

and it's not

540
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:18,140
if this week

541
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:25,140
uh...
