1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,929
and chris

2
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,619
seemed like a alcoholic meeting now

3
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:16,589
notes that i feel

4
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:17,988
way more comfortable right

5
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:19,240
because we all just

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,269
yelling try to reach other then we go
out to the normal world

7
00:00:22,269 --> 00:00:23,430
where they're not

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,429
out all the people i guess our

9
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:27,820
and we don't know about them right

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:33,420
uh... so a defect everyone here at secti
for for printing out uh...

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,890
i flight yesterday

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,750
uh... from colorado

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,510
where it was uh... i think old

14
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,519
time getting ready for winter to start
skin

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,980
and i want to thank you guys for wake up
early

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,580
and sitting and listening tonight

17
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,350
boring ass presentation

18
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,370
so

19
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,129
this is what a presentation looks like
ten do you know time caressing you have

20
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,120
to do that

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,230
like obligatory who the hell are you

22
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,989
section of your presentations that's
what this is

23
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,939
uh... that's me

24
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:06,279
uh... in

25
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,730
all sorts of different formats

26
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,370
of my favorite one is

27
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,140
sector s

28
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,780
uh... where i put on a four hundred
pound

29
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,050
that suit to give a talk on

30
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:22,070
using their linguistic programming to
pick up checks

31
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,809
because it was more fun than talking
about acting stuff

32
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,300
during that converts

33
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,070
my credentials

34
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,830
uh... a radio

35
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,789
uh... that's probably good normal
credentials that

36
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,330
people associate with me

37
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,630
it'll probably be easier if you view
those

38
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,560
not just the point one

39
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,760
i have

40
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,350
one of these wonderful searched uh...
you can see you if you go to the

41
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,559
internet

42
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,700
and snow use photoshop

43
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,570
uh...

44
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,130
act dot as i thought it was a really
awesome locked and they gave me a crappy

45
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,470
these paper

46
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,510
saas pretty disappointed

47
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,800
cassie's a locks are way better than the
certification is

48
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,420
uh... assesses p

49
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,419
which is sort of something that you can
get if you have photoshop

50
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:13,469
uh...

51
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:17,579
entirely you get back here in the system
to really really easy

52
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:20,449
seco objection

53
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:23,009
still you can't really easily

54
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,349
uh... so you can actually make it out as
well which is kind of fun

55
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:29,358
i have a whole bunch of other wall
stickers and stuff that i did because

56
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:32,689
i've been around and security for a
while 'cause editor of the conferences

57
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:36,469
which means event security forever

58
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:38,779
so there is a list of matter

59
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:40,459
softly

60
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:42,050
naples at the end of the day

61
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,750
whether i was uh... rocket scientist or
whether i was just

62
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,699
some should not be picked up at a bar

63
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:48,480
was on his arm

64
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,409
halfway entertaining and say something
new

65
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:52,809
really is a matter right

66
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:54,469
yeah no

67
00:02:54,469 --> 00:02:56,649
uh... on the front

68
00:02:56,649 --> 00:03:01,999
uh... feel like it to your free trial me
that's also fine alike highly correct it

69
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:03,930
if you want to throw me a line talking
on

70
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,409
all about it

71
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:09,469
phys i think it's funny to use this as i
usually do people

72
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:10,779
uh...

73
00:03:10,779 --> 00:03:11,520
also

74
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,699
in those un i'm not going to really talk
about packing very much

75
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:18,009
and i'll write you get a hacker showed
you don't

76
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:20,040
talk about acting as a first talkative

77
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,948
it'll get late start

78
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:23,189
self-conscious

79
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:27,759
prepare you for that on not gonna drop
o'day and activity jetta word i'll start

80
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,869
from

81
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:33,019
definitely not going to go over the off
stopped and how to act where that some

82
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:36,339
now you tell you about your friend
account security is and how you have to

83
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:37,989
shut it off and

84
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:41,509
you know run back to the mountains and
ignore everything because we get on the

85
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:44,918
lovely long

86
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:48,049
you like more than where you here

87
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:50,949
i'm not going to do it matter how much
you ask me

88
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:53,799
uh... probably will at some point 'cause
i'll get right to have a right

89
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,839
alendronate is crap was weak it was also

90
00:03:57,839 --> 00:04:02,689
here so you could do it but instinct
about some of the things

91
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:05,029
because if i a lot

92
00:04:05,029 --> 00:04:08,739
i do and i see a lot of different
clients a lot of france faces in markets

93
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:09,979
all over the planet

94
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:11,599
and it's

95
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,388
i have to think about these things all
the time and it and sometimes they come

96
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,699
to these little many other things

97
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,840
where actually feel like i learned
something in my career

98
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,498
and most the time i just

99
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:27,389
kind of shoe myself often like shut up
stop talking

100
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:34,389
sacrosanct eight so let's get started
with talking about something

101
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:38,300
and n_y_ and here is beginning at the
scene no one day

102
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,520
from uh...

103
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,229
from the sexy guys about a blog post in
a row

104
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:47,360
and the blockbuster wrote was this kind
of rediculous ramp losses on this

105
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,040
airplane n

106
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,050
hitler's all about

107
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,180
trying to understand what everybody's
writing about anonymous and we'll set

108
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,879
ctn

109
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:59,289
everybody get hacked all the time and
all the businesses that are going down

110
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:01,300
in reason this money

111
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,409
you know the sky is falling in

112
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:06,259
cats and dogs are living together and
it's it's just

113
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:09,120
chaos right

114
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,360
and i just sort of hidden debt so i
started

115
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,729
bucking any thinking wall while we

116
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:17,310
that pretty screwed

117
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,120
for ever

118
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,020
since will be since i've been in the
industry for the last fifteen years

119
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,400
right is

120
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,539
it hasn't gotten more

121
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:27,060
unmatched are

122
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,179
it's gotten more messed up people have
more stuff on on that's more audible

123
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:33,960
and it's really easy don't someone

124
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,808
at seventy-nine oh like it or not i
might that get it

125
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:40,669
but but why is it such a bleak

126
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:42,340
prevalent thing so

127
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,429
they don't like looking at all these
people get loans

128
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:48,080
them i'm thinking all right

129
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,539
they get on the over

130
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:52,589
and over

131
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:55,009
and all over

132
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:58,129
at over

133
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:00,380
and or

134
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,169
thanking you go out with this result of
of some of these people who work is the

135
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:06,150
biggest companies in the world

136
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,688
giddy absolutely b

137
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:09,650
that hit me

138
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,179
crappy dot

139
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:15,128
so what's you know what what's the point
of that right

140
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:19,019
all of us immediately go to the
following answer right which is our

141
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:21,379
users are stupid

142
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:24,569
writes all the time user's guide stepped
in

143
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:28,399
are awesome in pencil program or you
know the executives ur stupid because

144
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,360
they didn't let us get whatever for your
shelf whatever connection

145
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,499
all of these general type of things
right

146
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:36,419
it's it's it's the generic

147
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:39,969
security excuse that we've always used
to hit the high which is

148
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,509
walt the users are comment on that we
just have to deal with this environment

149
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:46,779
that's awful like that

150
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:51,949
i saw horrors like a sneak attack

151
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:56,169
that looks like a really fun

152
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:59,099
but it was just the people really aren't
ready and

153
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:03,210
it confuses me how they are not ready
especially since we spend so much money

154
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,060
in all of us are gainfully employed and
once we couldn't afford to conferences

155
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,719
right

156
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:14,099
so we have jobs we do security stuff yet
or not ready for this thing that our

157
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:16,639
whole career is built around being ready
for

158
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,559
edges

159
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:19,299
kinda confuses me so

160
00:07:19,299 --> 00:07:22,779
instead of looking at the industry
getting getting mad in

161
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:25,949
blaming people the industry whatever
also try to look it will what other

162
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:30,049
fights have we got it

163
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,938
all right let's let's get a look at the
evolution of war

164
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:37,080
right in-house sort of war

165
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,280
big major battles and wars of the fall

166
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,828
so uh... i was thinkin there's always
there's always like a superpower

167
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:46,559
of whatever time period is always
someone who's doing way better than

168
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:47,859
everybody else

169
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:51,948
and conquering lands in economically
dominating in

170
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:55,489
you know pretending to be the china of
right now

171
00:07:55,489 --> 00:08:00,190
and they have all the money and all the
people need to start taking suffer over

172
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,729
i was looking at those but i thought
well

173
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:05,289
all people who used to be

174
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:06,090
really

175
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,839
big-time superpowers

176
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:11,589
so exist anymore

177
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:16,149
i mean most of them are even around as
countries more less

178
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:20,849
evened surviving with all the way and
all of these wars that they thought

179
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:22,979
so the purchase

180
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:29,229
right there are one of the kind of
steeple beginning empire builders

181
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:30,159
they conquered

182
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,069
fast percentages

183
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,610
of the world

184
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,630
this giant persian army

185
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,860
that conquered most of the planet

186
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,639
completely old

187
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,070
but students

188
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,190
completely hoped

189
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,100
fetuses aliens would find them

190
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,330
which were there and some petty choke
point slaughter a whole bunch of a mile

191
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,180
away

192
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,579
and after doing that you know the
hundred times and they started filling

193
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,950
out the armies that i could go and start
fighting and handed straight-out like

194
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,380
these people

195
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,180
but they got so bad

196
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,890
that here in the persian leaders at the
time were surprised that their armies of

197
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,120
the thousands and thousands first
hundreds of people

198
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,800
we're getting away with the head

199
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,660
or even being able to get away

200
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,530
sounds kinda like what we're going to
right now a little bit doesn't it

201
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,510
surprise any business can get away

202
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,910
and even conduct business because
they're so easy to get out

203
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,230
send the romans writes the romans did a
good job that's who they started

204
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,730
conquering most of the world the brand
started destroying them and not out of

205
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:39,110
the woods established soldiers and
running backwards

206
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,290
he really beat up

207
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,280
but they start to weaken the world a
little bit so much that the docs ended

208
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,370
up beating them

209
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,200
those cuts

210
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,420
but would also ended up beating him as
the

211
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,920
in a historical person either

212
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,569
your biggest com

213
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,660
ruthless warriors

214
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,800
so bad they destroyed

215
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,270
from these hit-and-run tactics

216
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,810
from these kind of sneak attacks

217
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,790
the tactics

218
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,280
it it's it's still said today

219
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,280
the that no one really knows how he died

220
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,480
but the best theory is that oppresses
steady captured

221
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,390
prepare pliers in her staying

222
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,990
and hurt him so that we would he was
trying to take her

223
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,520
that he did not

224
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,990
that's hardcore

225
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,920
that is a complex it is the contact

226
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,160
if you know what's coming get ready

227
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,439
here's what we can point what if you we
put traps

228
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,829
and we figure out

229
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:48,520
how to survive this attacked

230
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,640
and what happens

231
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,220
seus old do an eye for an eye stuff and
run around horses i mean

232
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,890
we probably would be

233
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,140
had he not pass

234
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,500
sees all really relevant to us because
we have these giant businesses that are

235
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,300
taking over

236
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,490
vast majorities of the market space in
the beginning at all and in a kind of

237
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,000
latrobe looking out the corner for a
little bit

238
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,860
and they're like

239
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,029
gas so we just lost all your data

240
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:17,840
and we feel totally bad about it

241
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,050
you know they were selling

242
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,550
and still make a cool t_v_ for you or
something

243
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:27,069
if that's alright

244
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,920
it's silly but it's that

245
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,490
the kind of environment that we have to
do it

246
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,320
uh... we have the ottomans

247
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,900
desire out of an empire

248
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,110
ever versus dracula

249
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,060
okay

250
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,069
another just massive unbelievable force
the art of birds conquered

251
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,070
almost fall of

252
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,970
of multiple consonants

253
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,520
their everywhere they're like the roads
it has spread out because they were

254
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,680
owning everything

255
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,939
no all the sudden

256
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,750
he's low people up in the hills

257
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,390
for twenty five years

258
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,760
he couldn't come through that biggie
conquer everyone else they can occur

259
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,890
every one of the biggest military forces

260
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,929
but for twenty five years

261
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:14,160
yelping in southern wv

262
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,559
that's also and i think that that's a
lesson that we can learn

263
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,160
that some little group

264
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,819
held off of the largest superpower

265
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,430
in the world

266
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,280
for twenty

267
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,550
five your story

268
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,109
jane whatever they were morally dried
blood they kill people but still that's

269
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,510
pretty awesome

270
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,530
we had here

271
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,620
the sixteen hundreds

272
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,650
the dutch snapping

273
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,770
cdn who's trying to expand territories

274
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,930
there's a all sorts of awesome attacks
that one on

275
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,199
in the middle of the expansion of
territories to seventy min

276
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,920
and started destroying entire regions of
troops

277
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,740
with somewhere around a hundred to two
hundred dutch fighters

278
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,770
what they would do is how i do

279
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:07,000
in areas and wait until they can cause
such chaos

280
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,540
on the battlefield

281
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:12,829
when the people weren't ready to battle

282
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,220
people retreated because they had to
regroup

283
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:22,220
they had to figure out what is our
planned for fighting this force

284
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,510
this little guy

285
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,689
boys i got him the acts

286
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,610
before him

287
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,610
right and sure all of us know people at
the polling complexes who just freak out

288
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,020
illness because they're short after

289
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,199
napoleon stalin assert themselves

290
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,750
but not abril leader

291
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,260
officious dictator

292
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,370
inability of superpower

293
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,790
ended up giving birth

294
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,069
to the name gorilla

295
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,140
giving birth to the named guerrilla
forces

296
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,579
it was during this war is during

297
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:06,250
the the wars when france was trying to
conquer spain

298
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,490
that directly status

299
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:13,030
in one more tedious

300
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:17,360
taking forces of twenty or thirty people
and attacking legions of thousands of

301
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,170
french troops imagine that you like

302
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,089
hanging out

303
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,860
eating top us or whatever

304
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,760
and they like it we're going to go
mcintyre freshly shit

305
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,100
any sort of like a look around the
dinner table here like with what no

306
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,340
solace

307
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,010
the couple was a real attacked

308
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:43,010
the army that's crushing the planet

309
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,760
sounds cool

310
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,890
for me since i agree that lets go kill
some people

311
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,310
the hate event at their word dominating
those forces to the point where

312
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,478
worked even to pauline was was

313
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:58,370
forcing legions into the area
surrounding areas where he thought

314
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:03,310
di as and and some of the women do
releases lived eg burning down whole

315
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,560
cities just to try and get out one or
two of these people because they're

316
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,160
causing such cavities

317
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,540
on their forces

318
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,560
that it was more beneficial for him to
stop his war expansion in kill these

319
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,099
people but it was the continued

320
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,890
that's pretty awesome

321
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,930
and then i get my favorite right because
it was inbred into my history of being

322
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,699
wrong because i probably should be
british even on the hot

323
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,770
i'm used to like loudon going so they
had to make america

324
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,630
the if you have these people have funny
costumes right

325
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:38,490
and and they all in this country

326
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,820
and people in the country starts a
revolt

327
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,250
and a super power of the time

328
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,210
who owns all of this land all over the
world

329
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,490
is trying to keep control of their
citizens

330
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,410
citrus at least forty costumes in the
war i mean side

331
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,329
they go to war

332
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,810
as they go workin away

333
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,030
it's freely really conventional and kind
of

334
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,939
when we look at it now

335
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,100
they'd watching these big giant lines in
right red and white ka students like you

336
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,970
can't seal

337
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,310
you know thousand people in red thousand
which roams and trumpets and all sorts

338
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,660
of other crazy fanfare this like you
know

339
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,850
you don't know whether it's a parade in
d_c_ programs to get it dot

340
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,380
because that's how they did it back then

341
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,189
and what they decide that they were
going to things

342
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,220
they did it in such a grandiose skill
that they would try and psychologically

343
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,940
intimate their opponent

344
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,270
ordained realizes that in this
particular war

345
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,569
their opponent

346
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,680
was looking at them they had their eyes
open and they saw

347
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,920
hey i can see these guys coming miles
away

348
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,699
sort of they do

349
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,300
like any of us to do attacked networks
intact

350
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,300
people who attack anything

351
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:55,069
you identify what's the vulnerability
with this

352
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:59,600
stopping us

353
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,110
i can't be there for a month

354
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,920
friend you could tell me it's okay

355
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:10,920
were friends now

356
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,819
the drummer boy get thank you

357
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:17,270
it's giving away before they even get a
chance to fight

358
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,500
break is given away

359
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,839
before they ever get a chance to fight

360
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,139
issue that is

361
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,060
before you get a chance to fight

362
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,020
it's hard to melt their yard dead

363
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,810
and all you have to do is wait for it to
come to you

364
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:42,158
writes an opportunistic attacks

365
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:46,350
and the superpowers fall victim to
opportunistic attacked very very fairy

366
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,490
easily

367
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,480
so they want out

368
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,400
the kneel down

369
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,690
and they get a tissue

370
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,480
we have somebody screaming fire so you
definitely know when they would like

371
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:06,480
you know you could be taken some shots
of her listen to what elicit fire

372
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,260
they've got yet

373
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,610
erica okay

374
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:14,870
shoot again nellie said appeared talk

375
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,479
sting like it you really effective as a
technique but apparently that help them

376
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,800
conquered most of the planet

377
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,510
that way

378
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,400
ego

379
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,030
the voter abilities in there

380
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,530
fighting style was easily outing

381
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,020
by the guerrilla fighters

382
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,230
uh... i mean pro fighters because their
height

383
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,059
and they can't hide very easily indicate
really small numbers of troops

384
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:42,309
and attacked these jut superpower bass
resources

385
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:44,799
anymore planning

386
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,929
mike and i'm planning is that planning
is guessing

387
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:50,960
it's just a cast placement dancing with
graphs

388
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,220
uh...

389
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,710
but but they're planning for all these
types of fights and they were losing

390
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,770
every single one of them because their
plan was wrong because they weren't

391
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,010
planning for these guys

392
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:06,410
because there and he was getting

393
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:12,620
to anybody though this photographer

394
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,699
awesome

395
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,020
thousand is

396
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,450
some awesome photography you see the guy
sitting in the

397
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,480
d_c_ upsetting their basis so cool

398
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,299
part of the one in because it

399
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:25,279
it's just so awesome when you think of

400
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:27,990
how do you hide in plain sight

401
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,380
and when you hide in plain sight

402
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,060
that's where you're the most effective
because you're not constrained by your

403
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,679
hiding spot

404
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,090
you get to be in the open and everyone
else is hiding

405
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,010
behind a firewall behind their defenses
behind

406
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,610
all of the things that the plants they
have their plan so far in something in

407
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,969
front of their face

408
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:48,940
that they can't

409
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,840
actually move

410
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,889
they just have to follow the plan they
have blinders on they're not allowed to

411
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,860
go anywhere else

412
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,580
which allows them to get conquered

413
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:02,020
very quickly

414
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,139
and conquered they got

415
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,310
over and over and over and over and over
again

416
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,760
tackling trying to act

417
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,210
to put all the compromises in one page
and it ended up being like

418
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,140
size

419
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,809
point zero zero one font and

420
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:20,370
yet just look like a wants a lines
across the paper because there are so

421
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:23,179
many of them

422
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,680
but what happens

423
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,530
well after you find these
vulnerabilities in these big may get

424
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,470
people because of

425
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,710
how they operate where they operate and
what they do in the constraints that

426
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,140
they have

427
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,870
you get to take on the superpowers in
berwyn

428
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,260
you don't just get to fight them in
embarrass them

429
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,560
you literally win against them

430
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,639
so

431
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,450
in looking at those a sort of looking a
little bit at you know what's the

432
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,560
structure of coral warfare

433
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,779
hasn't happened because

434
00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:54,220
it's obvious from history lessons

435
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,599
that it works

436
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,799
the works really really well

437
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:01,490
now posse tong in in all of them said
yes you have to have carolyn

438
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,540
conventional warfare blended together
which ivory with

439
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,500
the real leadership structure of
guerrilla warfare

440
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,470
worst public something else that we know
for a

441
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:18,500
theirselves there's seven to resist
fields clients they have training

442
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,090
they have some type of coordinated
logistics

443
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:26,350
but their ability to be flexible
persists

444
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,169
they have some type of political
affiliation so that they keep getting

445
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:32,880
more guerrilla fighters with them
without having to spend the time

446
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,160
to go in the role people and why do you
need to join my cause

447
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,900
their causes joyful

448
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,730
meeting if you think someone's going to
attack you today if their causes joy

449
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:48,590
double tomorrow there is more of those
attackers that you planned for today

450
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:53,310
it will continue to grow and you can
anticipate its growth

451
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,970
that's a really heartening to fight

452
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,410
especially in our industry to really
part of the fight

453
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,480
if you knew

454
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,140
every it's it's the same case that we
make for popping at the address is in by

455
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,630
ideas too stupid

456
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,639
because walk great of change my address

457
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:08,149
okay all of these and other ports

458
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,690
final push a check for example it so
make it come from the entire eight it

459
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,480
will be deleted blackwell internet

460
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,450
right we have excuses against that

461
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:23,260
because of that in a moment

462
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,490
some of those history lessons

463
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,710
my answer

464
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:31,240
human stupidity one

465
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,100
is the only patches experience

466
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,879
you touch the stove enough you either
you know become the type of person who

467
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,220
really enjoys painting gets off on it or

468
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,510
you realize that it's hot and that sucks
in that you want to put a stop anymore

469
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,740
cus it hurts and that's just not
followed

470
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,690
anyway the fun things not things at her

471
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:56,559
apparently again stupider kids we can
get this we've got our ass kicked in

472
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,570
vietnam

473
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,530
because they fear drag

474
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:04,280
they're like will blow air own people
your people everybody because we are

475
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,379
going to take what opportunities we have

476
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,610
and capitalize on them to win

477
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:14,209
because we are not playing the game
we're playing only to win

478
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,830
so they decided alright what we know

479
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,710
what's going on we know the battlefield
better then

480
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,780
the people who are trying

481
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,760
to hangout with us

482
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,550
so it's not that we really need to learn
is that

483
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:30,169
the battlefield that you have to be
squarely defined by your knowledge of

484
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,360
that battlefield

485
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,110
if you know that the equals and getting
ready in this type of way

486
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:40,790
allows you to fight hundreds of
thousands of troops with thousands of

487
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,899
people

488
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,310
you have a severe tactical advantage

489
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:51,519
so the reason i'm talking about all this
if it doesn't make sense is because

490
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:55,830
i want us to understand unidentified
that it's not about spending money it's

491
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,939
not about creating

492
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,750
but the fact structure it's about
knowing the battlefield that were on

493
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,179
so that we can be ready to fight

494
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:07,770
instead of here eighty two percent

495
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,908
because the fed's only has one option

496
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,410
success

497
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,100
phone that you lose

498
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:19,279
fighting you can fight with defense you
can fight

499
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,940
even losing certain portions of that
because if you

500
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,000
perked them well enough it's like giving
up your queen

501
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,470
in a game of chess

502
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:30,020
if u trapped them in a way that you know
it's your benefit you can take and

503
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,610
sustain loss is correctly

504
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:35,260
in order to survive the war

505
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,220
that's a big day

506
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,010
and we got we we bring it home with
their tails between their legs we

507
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:43,629
learned a lot from their but we're in a
row

508
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,880
so i was always like last fall

509
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,030
right now our businesses of the
superpowers

510
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,039
the businesses that were in

511
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,549
they were trying to secure

512
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:56,490
are the superpowers

513
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,309
we make the money

514
00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:00,260
we have the interwebs

515
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,110
we on the i_p_ space

516
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:05,090
there's a bunch of people out there who
either one access to it

517
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,560
politically-motivated against the stuff
that our company does or maybe just want

518
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,540
to go attack us for fun because they can
prove that they can

519
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,029
so what what what what what are like
conventional strategy against

520
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:22,180
all of these types of attacks we go to
happen every single day everywhere

521
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,730
using correction

522
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,700
which is

523
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,830
so anybody i assault have those t-shirts

524
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,780
so you may remember that

525
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,910
balanced cyst

526
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,700
glory days right there

527
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,770
you can export it by i'll make a teacher

528
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:36,879
that

529
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,790
ego

530
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,889
it's just great

531
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:44,110
paid so so that works really well

532
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:48,530
intrusion prevention detection systems
soon seeing how that stuff usually works

533
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:54,520
really really really well anybody have
idea systems that work awesome

534
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,620
once it one more time in case

535
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:02,770
i suspect it is anyone have an idea
system that works really well

536
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,950
yeah it does get market

537
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:08,730
uh... prevention

538
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,510
that's that's a fancy word

539
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,180
and we have one of those that works well

540
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,450
this is this is

541
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,110
our arms for openers

542
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,250
if you really don't work right

543
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,830
but we've got about our

544
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,699
how antivirus

545
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:30,510
so what has it that i missed that works
well right

546
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,809
now

547
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:34,559
behind

548
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,320
another question

549
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,590
how they have you been hacked

550
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,959
can go on for now

551
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,070
one honest person who lives in the room

552
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,110
do you recognize

553
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:51,178
that when you get a virus

554
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:54,260
bad things happen

555
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,460
have-nots

556
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,090
yes

557
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:02,399
how did you look at a glance

558
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:03,489
jed

559
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:07,940
k when people got hacked

560
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,870
problem when i was people

561
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:13,169
we're getting somewhere

562
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,120
when you get virus

563
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,610
that means

564
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:20,290
that something compromise the control

565
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,379
or that it is of

566
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,090
in your system

567
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,019
in major system do something that

568
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:27,810
it was not planning to do

569
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,960
ichi

570
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,740
you got hacked if you've got a virus

571
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,010
if you've ever been i mean i don't wanna
lick

572
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,850
i raise my hand at this conference than
my stock prices my company went down

573
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,870
i get that

574
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,479
but we have to is recognized

575
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,550
that when you get buyers is you have
been hacked so so we can at least get

576
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:51,430
over the although i've never been hacked
it anybody who says that is this a

577
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,950
straight-up liar

578
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:55,570
i don't i don't know anyone on the
planet

579
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:58,379
and less you just don't have technology

580
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,540
and even then you've probably been
hacked socially like often

581
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:07,270
because we all have manipulative women
and men in our life that actress a

582
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,950
regular pathology i'm married i gotta
act

583
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,830
with that

584
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:16,439
benevolent at st and i just i just
accepted like i've know that i got after

585
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,920
i get it

586
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,210
and over that part

587
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,620
bike now this try not to get hacked
every single day at home ilike pick

588
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:27,389
which starts again act which doesn't
even work

589
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,390
just making sure you know i am chaparro
exits

590
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,720
i've got no game left

591
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,600
all right

592
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:39,000
house that we deal with this tough
strong authentication

593
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,060
somewhat has thrown off that works

594
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:48,428
single sign on

595
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:51,290
that's awesome because i love fighting
those people because they pulled up to

596
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,010
them because

597
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,890
had never seen it work

598
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,260
right plays fewer some places

599
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,510
and then also the it goes from like
working really really well for one day

600
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,930
their business

601
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,260
sort of shifts to doing something new

602
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:07,240
and then their whole life gets torn
apart because the one application that

603
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,500
they are using doesn't integrate with
like

604
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,019
tivoli year whatever cool off medication
solution that they're using

605
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:14,530
the right way

606
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:17,610
and that it breaks the whole thing in
they go back to just go in whatever

607
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:22,209
login include tax or give a shit

608
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,520
uh... integrity moderator

609
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,450
we do that too

610
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:30,230
breaks all these things are great we
stop colleagues also munitions right we

611
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,830
stopped by all these things and

612
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,189
while management and

613
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:37,380
we have all these great metrics we have
always awesome plans right at the end of

614
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,120
the day

615
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,989
feet deep manifest themselves into this
john i a pile of crap that sits in

616
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:46,210
server rooms in our desktop and annoys
us because it has pop ups all the time

617
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,490
of whatever else and

618
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:53,660
and our firewall blocks everything in in
order to go

619
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,290
all of these way over-funded armies who
planned for everything and had the

620
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,290
troops in that

621
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:03,639
i commend in horses in this and that
every style of whatever the cool new

622
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,960
thing wasn't

623
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,280
and they were the leaders because they
had all the great technology and

624
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,720
everything else n

625
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,610
they just got off

626
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,990
because they spent apart of money
building one of these

627
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,630
for a fight where people had like jets
and bombs

628
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:23,490
when one of those does not survive well

629
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,730
against those types of flights

630
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,350
and even then

631
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:31,110
all those are pretty good you know you
do

632
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:34,120
instead of attacking a interest walk-in

633
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,449
the distal kill the king

634
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:39,820
and that all sudden people don't know
what to do any more

635
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:43,299
so it's really easy ways to attack
things

636
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:47,480
and get around this massive giant
grandiose plan that we have fight

637
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,010
at eight liken this to to describe it

638
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:54,500
my house was leaking

639
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,660
and iris was leaking pretty badly so
that you know my life after she

640
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:03,470
continued acne over and over again and
made me feel bad about myself

641
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:08,730
i decided so i completed a man right so
undergo fix my roof

642
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,200
so i thought stairs in

643
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,559
and figure out where this week is
through some

644
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,139
total gift of job because

645
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:20,229
god knows i've not pay any person i'd
break stuff i don't fix it

646
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:23,159
ends and i think you know where the
speeches and i like

647
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:26,359
read on the internet and google teaches
me how to fix my roof announces that

648
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,168
they would like

649
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:32,210
might poppins inlet i'm the only person
if it is the river the laptop

650
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,990
mobile people use like males

651
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:40,070
shingles blew himself up i'd like to
have my laptop lay off about

652
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,850
uh... temple

653
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,969
stupid i t person right

654
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,840
and figured out

655
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,100
garlic one of the hallways against her
thinking and i look really proud of

656
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,490
myself on public i'd fix my roof this is
also

657
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,720
any reader that daylight time for the
walk downstairs might do you have to

658
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,760
eliminate apus handled

659
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,230
the next day or a it's like crazy and
right around would like this big smile

660
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,770
at a slight

661
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,570
dot you mean

662
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,050
you don't have anything

663
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,168
but you can even

664
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:12,290
get in my house like

665
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,879
leak is fixed

666
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,180
and came home

667
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:20,500
four like computers were completely
dressed in water

668
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:25,899
i had a section of my four

669
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:27,979
we destroy

670
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,860
there's a mold on the walls

671
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,330
from the state is winter

672
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:37,439
leaving so so confident as likely the
same house leaders don't let the vegas

673
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,649
philly campaign

674
00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:43,320
speak via of stupid

675
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,439
the part that

676
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,720
the kind of threw me for a loop doesn't
like it

677
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,419
how did this happen

678
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:53,020
uh... close the window open

679
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:57,400
entering canada window

680
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,150
i was

681
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,610
i would ask that hours

682
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:03,250
blurted out the truth

683
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,000
of my house got destroyed because the
window was open

684
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,019
this is the crappy as they have our
right but

685
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:14,350
i was thinking about it at one of those
likud implicit comments of late

686
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:17,870
this is a metaphor for every single day
that i live

687
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:22,489
is that going to do all this crazy work
to show them this one a whole

688
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:27,600
and the winner gets left open in
everything gets destroyed

689
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,240
so i thought i'd share that example i
have you guys

690
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,150
culture stuff like this at work

691
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:37,049
this is like the weird susa fist life
that we lead worry like push the rock up

692
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:40,330
more like jack added to the top of the
rolls over assumedly push it up to the

693
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:45,039
other email

694
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,170
so he did

695
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,720
so you probably rock on the same page
that

696
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,860
superpowers get attacked the mountain

697
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,350
but the strategies that we use

698
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:59,120
don't really worked as the saxophone it

699
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,699
first part

700
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,600
after i would like to walk around with
those things in his post about their

701
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,009
work

702
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:08,339
week we have to try to stop

703
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:11,239
thinking about what everybody else is
doing

704
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:14,359
because it doesn't really benefit us at
all

705
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:18,598
if if you base your protection program
of your business

706
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:21,200
based on someone that you know or
something that you know

707
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,779
in another business

708
00:34:22,779 --> 00:34:25,309
you're setting yourself up to fail

709
00:34:25,309 --> 00:34:28,499
because your business is unique right

710
00:34:28,498 --> 00:34:30,688
otherwise you wouldn't have competitors
i mean

711
00:34:30,688 --> 00:34:32,538
does anyone here work for bike

712
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:34,219
microsoft r

713
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,599
one of those companies

714
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,879
that just doesn't have to better ders

715
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:44,618
but most of us have competitors which
means our businesses need unique

716
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:45,849
so if we

717
00:34:45,849 --> 00:34:50,319
protected in a unique way we're just
setting yourself up to get only everyone

718
00:34:50,319 --> 00:34:52,458
else

719
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:56,208
so why are we doing all the same things
as them one word different business with

720
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:57,868
tech our business

721
00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:00,899
seem to stop worrying about what they're
doing we had to stop reading about all

722
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:01,509
this

723
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,679
does not because he is new

724
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:07,519
you know dispelling you'll be skinny and
pretty singers

725
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:10,569
but that stuff just doesn't work maybe
someday it will put in my experience

726
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:15,449
i've never seen any of those things that
the silver bullet work

727
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:19,520
yet we just blow bunch of money on it
and then we all go sat and uh... when

728
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,309
you know stuff breaks at the end of the
day or lexar com my

729
00:35:23,309 --> 00:35:25,799
last didn't stop the sequel ejection
there like

730
00:35:25,799 --> 00:35:29,299
well it looks for what he calls wanting
you take two vehicles they will

731
00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:32,799
and it's really got around everything
but what it is a picture so that when

732
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:36,799
somebody by staples are you because it
is again

733
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:39,159
uh... it's it's ridiculous but

734
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:43,969
sally make their money

735
00:35:43,969 --> 00:35:47,129
there's no such thing as saying forget

736
00:35:47,129 --> 00:35:51,729
everything you have in your environment
needs care and feeding and testing and

737
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:52,589
training

738
00:35:52,589 --> 00:35:53,619
everything

739
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:56,319
the people the devices all of that stuff

740
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:59,969
and and it states because we're like a
tall man that sounds like work

741
00:35:59,969 --> 00:36:04,349
what if if you're not going to do it
that way just don't put it in its easier

742
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:07,389
is easier to just get own through that
back there

743
00:36:07,389 --> 00:36:10,619
didn't go through the heartbreak of like
i've got all interesting that was poorly

744
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:12,609
managed

745
00:36:12,609 --> 00:36:16,839
anybody get own because a crappy
firewall rules

746
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:18,799
acts

747
00:36:18,799 --> 00:36:22,449
you make it so you major telcos that
worked for in the states that all the

748
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:24,149
world's just got

749
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:27,348
own wildcats any any

750
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:29,149
wide dalbello

751
00:36:29,149 --> 00:36:32,939
south bend for the last ten years
waiting in a box been diverted here's

752
00:36:32,939 --> 00:36:34,459
like yet

753
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:39,249
it works perfect right to do anything

754
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:41,399
delegates up

755
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:44,618
by altered to you'd still like a way

756
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,359
conflicted

757
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:49,109
isn't that didn't make that work up a
bit acts

758
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:50,739
stride

759
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:54,819
ten made network argos know how to make
pipe no one cares still works we get the

760
00:36:54,819 --> 00:36:58,649
interweb i can see my kitties

761
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:02,899
so there is no magic bullet

762
00:37:02,899 --> 00:37:06,379
because people get really lazy when they
think they have a magic bullet

763
00:37:06,379 --> 00:37:09,219
you know like the people who go out and
uh...

764
00:37:09,219 --> 00:37:11,239
whatever eat

765
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:16,499
maple syrup and drink water dieter you
know whatever crazy fad diets there are

766
00:37:16,499 --> 00:37:18,209
biggest sidewalk on it

767
00:37:18,209 --> 00:37:22,299
do this one thing and i'm not gonna
exercise and magically my body is going

768
00:37:22,299 --> 00:37:24,879
to become like this temple bar some

769
00:37:24,879 --> 00:37:27,699
you know i don't look like i should be
and three hundred

770
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:28,959
because i keep

771
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:31,330
chicken all day long and donating else

772
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,120
it's crazy

773
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,770
easy but what we subscribe ourselves
these things simply couldn't force

774
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,199
ourselves to be lazier

775
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:42,179
because we like motorola put all my pics
in in this uh...

776
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:43,100
uti n

777
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:47,529
and uh... whatever palo alto does deep
inspection

778
00:37:47,529 --> 00:37:49,099
who cares

779
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:52,669
if that things are by the way what i'm
doing a task on a break in the building

780
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:54,680
steely where the thing out of the rat

781
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,970
go back home and hackett n like lassie
you because

782
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,230
i might have a cool new device are
probably like

783
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:03,979
well it's on that packing from your last

784
00:38:03,979 --> 00:38:07,009
just because it's funny

785
00:38:07,009 --> 00:38:10,719
pate that's one of the factors going to
do that legal alone

786
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:13,029
carroll campbell laugh

787
00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:15,589
forget it at that somebody else

788
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:18,899
because it sounded like although they
haven't laughed at that i get by it

789
00:38:18,899 --> 00:38:19,709
we give

790
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:21,388
a stupid is that

791
00:38:21,389 --> 00:38:23,459
when they publish it out to the internet

792
00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:26,259
make money 'cause the researchers frank

793
00:38:26,259 --> 00:38:29,689
it's also

794
00:38:29,689 --> 00:38:33,109
complexity reduces security

795
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:37,879
anyway agree with that

796
00:38:37,879 --> 00:38:41,759
i try to have this conversation with
uh... an anti-virus vendor

797
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:43,829
once

798
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:45,119
dan ferris vendor

799
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,589
was stressed that the two of you know
and i was laughing because they look

800
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:49,529
silly

801
00:38:49,529 --> 00:38:52,619
donald talked

802
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:55,249
but i was kind of the conversation over

803
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,819
if you put your

804
00:38:56,819 --> 00:38:58,969
staying on my machine

805
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,069
i become more vulnerable

806
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:05,489
they're like no it's an i_r_s_ and hours
and i this is an eye

807
00:39:05,489 --> 00:39:08,939
you know don't screw up social engineer
ticket does everything right olin is

808
00:39:08,939 --> 00:39:12,670
everything 'cause whatever at city paper
forty nine dollars a year for

809
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:15,939
is the security from absolutely
everything

810
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:18,419
and that's what this product does and
what block

811
00:39:18,419 --> 00:39:22,519
let's just take it from a poor
perspective

812
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:25,008
two ports okinawa box right now

813
00:39:25,009 --> 00:39:27,979
if i install it doesn't open another
port

814
00:39:27,979 --> 00:39:29,489
ehrlich yet

815
00:39:29,489 --> 00:39:33,219
whatsoever from having two holes if you
get attacked

816
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:35,969
two three

817
00:39:35,969 --> 00:39:42,969
asylum was made a really inappropriate
girlfriend joke about that

818
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:47,509
satiety also attacked late

819
00:39:47,509 --> 00:39:50,979
users may be more vulnerable and they're
like no major last fall the more because

820
00:39:50,979 --> 00:39:53,399
now if you get stuff i am machine

821
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:59,919
what if somebody hacks away court that
you opened on their way

822
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:01,719
acts like i have been

823
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:04,169
uh... i showed him cvs of like

824
00:40:04,169 --> 00:40:08,729
all of those that you can exploits
inadequate

825
00:40:08,729 --> 00:40:12,069
catholic put what about the israeli well
you know

826
00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:13,999
false happen

827
00:40:13,999 --> 00:40:18,069
types of do you work do you not be
people more probable annoyed no indicate

828
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:20,470
couldn't get the basic understanding
about

829
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:23,788
i had two ways to attack you're going
through a subject

830
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:25,519
now it's not saying

831
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:27,908
don't go put anything on things

832
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:31,309
but it's a way to look at risk quite
differently

833
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:32,579
rights i want

834
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:34,909
to try and spread the message that

835
00:40:34,909 --> 00:40:36,920
risk isn't always what's

836
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,939
urgent

837
00:40:37,939 --> 00:40:41,979
and right in front of you it could be
just the theory of i have more factors i

838
00:40:41,979 --> 00:40:43,388
have to protect

839
00:40:43,389 --> 00:40:45,120
is it worth my time

840
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,939
for the benefits that i get

841
00:40:46,939 --> 00:40:48,719
bistro but in that regard

842
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:52,949
in the answer with a views yeah it is

843
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:59,949
but it's still a fact that it makes you
more volatile f

844
00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:02,769
absolutely

845
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:06,769
yeah i think i don't think that that's
thing right its peak

846
00:41:06,769 --> 00:41:09,919
you can't fix those because judo owned
that while

847
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,969
well maybe you do on semantic

848
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:14,589
it if you get out

849
00:41:14,589 --> 00:41:18,019
kiss your hats for drinks or something

850
00:41:18,019 --> 00:41:21,930
but now you're totally right you know
it's you're taking these things and that

851
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:25,249
you can even really control at the end
of the day the most you can do is look

852
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:28,388
apply the stupid patch thing that they
give you

853
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:30,059
parsers are stalled at

854
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:32,089
the way they two connections are still
that

855
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:35,200
it's sockets are all screwed up this
work with windows and like

856
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:42,200
breaks every t_c_i_ people that there is

857
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:56,639
could simply can't be like putting stuff

858
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:25,939
their absolutely in in you know and and
the what ends up coming down the is

859
00:42:25,939 --> 00:42:30,408
do you trust your users to be
responsible and browse safely

860
00:42:30,409 --> 00:42:32,579
or do you know that they're just to be
like

861
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:35,089
love puppies

862
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:36,749
included

863
00:42:36,749 --> 00:42:38,169
behave

864
00:42:38,169 --> 00:42:42,219
and after that so we have had a good
that it is like a says the puppy ki

865
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:44,419
videos that are going to tak does

866
00:42:44,419 --> 00:42:45,910
kill us more different

867
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:49,788
trying to teach these people are browse
securely and for you and i

868
00:42:49,789 --> 00:42:53,069
week you go without the v_ and be safe

869
00:42:53,069 --> 00:42:54,420
uh... whereas

870
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,549
but user who's just gonna madly click on
stuff until something happens

871
00:42:58,549 --> 00:43:00,849
is getting a little bit long right

872
00:43:00,849 --> 00:43:03,059
so it's edson awesome point

873
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:07,089
right is is weighing the benefits of the
complexity that your building

874
00:43:07,089 --> 00:43:08,319
is it worth putting

875
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:13,009
another five devices aboard and i do yes
that actually glistens on a port or

876
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:16,829
oblast in this and that because that's
just one more foothold somebody can get

877
00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:21,020
on your network so puzzled look at those
benefits are automatically assume

878
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:24,040
that putting in this new security
technology is making you better

879
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,560
because no matter what issues you turn
the thing on you've made yourself more

880
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,589
vulnerable it's up to you

881
00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:31,969
to realize the benefit after that

882
00:43:31,969 --> 00:43:33,459
and make it

883
00:43:33,459 --> 00:43:35,969
give you benefit

884
00:43:35,969 --> 00:43:39,139
and it's like having waits around her
house

885
00:43:39,139 --> 00:43:43,059
anybody stub their toe on waits before
it sucks you break it all too often you

886
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:47,139
describe yell at the thing like we can
move

887
00:43:47,139 --> 00:43:48,149
but it can

888
00:43:48,149 --> 00:43:52,279
so what you get yourself more vulnerable
to a fitness product

889
00:43:52,279 --> 00:43:55,209
that was supposed to make you less
vulnerable to stuff

890
00:43:55,209 --> 00:43:58,428
we put it in the middle because like
you're not used to playing with weights

891
00:43:58,429 --> 00:44:03,549
and this is now go before the new trip
over it and break your neck

892
00:44:03,549 --> 00:44:06,769
gotta be smart about some of the things

893
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,930
finally

894
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:11,999
trying to understand what matters to
environments

895
00:44:11,999 --> 00:44:15,339
really helps you protect the environment

896
00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:17,899
saying protect everything

897
00:44:17,899 --> 00:44:19,598
if that's your strategy

898
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,529
i'm sorry it's not sustainable

899
00:44:23,529 --> 00:44:26,999
that was like you know the persons of
the romance conquer everything take over

900
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:33,319
the world logistical bura bigot of
chocolate you can give anything you want

901
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:37,649
have enough money so that you could tell
anyone to stick it

902
00:44:37,649 --> 00:44:39,618
then you don't need all the money you
just need

903
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:44,699
a lot of it

904
00:44:44,699 --> 00:44:47,529
how do you figure that out stuff out to
get on figure out public what's

905
00:44:47,529 --> 00:44:49,919
important in the company

906
00:44:49,919 --> 00:44:52,269
some either through it quickly

907
00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:54,359
so i figure out what's important

908
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:55,639
your product line

909
00:44:55,639 --> 00:44:57,919
your brand

910
00:44:57,919 --> 00:45:00,158
oddly enough the employees

911
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:03,099
those are the ones that we don't want to
take ur important because you know we

912
00:45:03,099 --> 00:45:06,009
manage business-like al will just get
new ones but they really are important

913
00:45:06,009 --> 00:45:07,809
to do is what what's your

914
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:10,139
transferred

915
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:12,939
and the bottom line

916
00:45:12,939 --> 00:45:16,848
what you're doing if putting on the
firewall is putting a night yes is

917
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:19,909
making a new control it's doing
debugging if

918
00:45:19,909 --> 00:45:23,450
properly here if you're still see all
those things if you can't hide them

919
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,888
to some of these

920
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,919
types of things in the company

921
00:45:27,919 --> 00:45:30,859
you're doing a job

922
00:45:30,859 --> 00:45:33,019
you're protecting what's important

923
00:45:33,019 --> 00:45:36,279
if you're putting it in because you just
walk what women

924
00:45:36,279 --> 00:45:39,760
dur doctor in your job because you're
not tying it to the company

925
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,379
different deccan company you're just
protecting

926
00:45:42,379 --> 00:45:45,058
like your job or

927
00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:49,129
you're drinking stories hugo talents for
one of those last week ur protecting

928
00:45:49,129 --> 00:45:52,578
your resume because you want a bill work
someone else after the company that

929
00:45:52,579 --> 00:45:56,619
you're failing to protect its own

930
00:45:56,619 --> 00:45:58,310
so how do you mike defying

931
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:00,399
somebody that's in there with first

932
00:46:00,399 --> 00:46:04,379
do you have to realize that our opinions
don't matter

933
00:46:04,379 --> 00:46:07,348
well you know what paper are paying
in-state totally don't matter when it

934
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:10,689
comes protection

935
00:46:10,689 --> 00:46:12,999
the method of implementation

936
00:46:12,999 --> 00:46:16,158
is where we get to exercise our
expertise

937
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:16,759
but not in

938
00:46:16,759 --> 00:46:19,399
picking what needs to be protected

939
00:46:19,399 --> 00:46:22,529
right that's the businesses

940
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,530
they have to know their business wall of

941
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:28,369
because then they can help you and see
if this is the gold this is what we

942
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:29,849
think is the most valuable

943
00:46:29,849 --> 00:46:32,470
you do your booty magic i_t_c_ purity
stuff

944
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:35,738
on that little thing and make sure
nobody steals that

945
00:46:35,739 --> 00:46:38,709
not don't have to whole company because
that's like saying

946
00:46:38,709 --> 00:46:40,979
defended the entire empire

947
00:46:40,979 --> 00:46:41,979
don't care

948
00:46:41,979 --> 00:46:44,919
if you wanna keep the empire defend
what's important and let the other stuff

949
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,310
get attacked near there

950
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:50,109
and do your best to mitigate those

951
00:46:50,109 --> 00:46:53,149
yeah i think like the execuse it you'd
think with the business in order to

952
00:46:53,149 --> 00:46:55,910
protect itself as you're trying to
protect these things

953
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:59,828
if there's certain feel the in all we
need a credit cards with or protection

954
00:46:59,829 --> 00:47:00,909
on that

955
00:47:00,909 --> 00:47:02,150
than other areas

956
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:05,669
if you can't get to that area at any
other way

957
00:47:05,669 --> 00:47:09,810
or maybe it's a specific server maybe
it's a physical maybe you area bank

958
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:15,719
anyone actually protect the physical
money personal troubling whatever it is

959
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:17,509
to offer to work

960
00:47:17,509 --> 00:47:20,679
its focus on the business yes try and
identify

961
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:23,619
whose the owner

962
00:47:23,619 --> 00:47:25,659
if try and figure out bull

963
00:47:25,659 --> 00:47:32,130
how does all this stuff play into my
scenario

964
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:35,979
again if i were comes from where it goes
how the money gets it there

965
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:39,629
so other protections that you have

966
00:47:39,629 --> 00:47:43,299
to be a security shopper they built to
be protecting the money that the company

967
00:47:43,299 --> 00:47:44,689
makes

968
00:47:44,689 --> 00:47:46,848
that's a hard question to answer

969
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:49,709
because a lot of us just go ahead with
the far one of the company makes more

970
00:47:49,709 --> 00:47:51,749
money magically

971
00:47:51,749 --> 00:47:55,529
but really do the late work to try and
figure out all the way down to have a

972
00:47:55,529 --> 00:47:58,629
more dollars do you have right now that
you would have

973
00:47:58,629 --> 00:48:02,149
if this was a man and i guarantee you
you'll get way different levels of

974
00:48:02,149 --> 00:48:04,138
support from the staff

975
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:06,589
and from the other people you work with

976
00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:09,949
if you can say i bought the firewall for
ten grand but it just a few ten million

977
00:48:09,949 --> 00:48:13,839
dollars you can show them exactly how
that works you'll get all the money you

978
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:14,700
ever wanted

979
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,948
i've never had problems with security
program budget f

980
00:48:17,949 --> 00:48:20,279
and i know it's like shocking

981
00:48:20,279 --> 00:48:23,319
that ever i've never even had some of
the challenge me

982
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:26,049
'cause they're like to have assistance
that we spend ten grant to make ten

983
00:48:26,049 --> 00:48:29,779
million alone for that dot

984
00:48:29,779 --> 00:48:33,009
yeah think thirty sometimes

985
00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:35,760
because sometimes showing people impact
really helps

986
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,470
so if you know what impacts them you
know how really show them the level of

987
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:40,169
impact

988
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:43,430
not showing the michelle in a box but
actually showing the war we've got a

989
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:48,459
hospital and this time they kill all the
patients today

990
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:54,009
that's a big difference to will here's a
show on the health system

991
00:48:54,009 --> 00:48:55,160
they don't care about that

992
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,249
philip what's the low-cost box that's
funny

993
00:48:58,249 --> 00:49:00,618
i remember i used to use those when i
was a kid

994
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:04,489
like elavil there's just a minute like
that whatever

995
00:49:04,489 --> 00:49:07,149
enjoy your day and computer world

996
00:49:07,149 --> 00:49:09,138
crazy here again

997
00:49:09,139 --> 00:49:12,219
you know they like go back downstairs
ought to get out of all i can give you

998
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:15,059
left operand or whatever it is that your
into

999
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:17,900
that they don't care to people you put
with you go

1000
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:22,229
we're at a hospital and i figured out
how to kill all the patients a day

1001
00:49:22,229 --> 00:49:25,919
the differences like them listening to
you

1002
00:49:25,919 --> 00:49:28,449
arguable we don't want your good

1003
00:49:28,449 --> 00:49:30,499
utilities should stay

1004
00:49:30,499 --> 00:49:32,459
what's that about

1005
00:49:32,459 --> 00:49:36,198
and that you showed it like the alcohol
that ever happened however

1006
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:39,769
so whatever here's a checked and they
give you like one of the big

1007
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:42,279
you know you want to golf tournament
checks

1008
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:45,499
and they're like you just use this check
in australia for anything you want

1009
00:49:45,499 --> 00:49:46,158
because it

1010
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:49,829
back it never happened soco make itself

1011
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:52,579
you have all your money

1012
00:49:52,579 --> 00:49:54,889
it's unbelievable how works

1013
00:49:54,889 --> 00:49:59,709
they've really been who does

1014
00:49:59,709 --> 00:50:01,009
but that doesn't work

1015
00:50:01,009 --> 00:50:03,869
will help in force your competition to
be better than you are if you're in the

1016
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:07,589
number to spot the number three viewed
over one of their number five

1017
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:11,259
can you show them how axle of some beer
intellectual property

1018
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:14,409
we actually destroy your place in the
market

1019
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:17,349
because buchanan and you put your
business case together for that

1020
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:19,729
it you show them this is how it works

1021
00:50:19,729 --> 00:50:23,660
now you're showing them hey guys what
kind of the senate always wanted on the

1022
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,408
roof but the window is open it

1023
00:50:26,409 --> 00:50:27,919
and

1024
00:50:27,919 --> 00:50:30,888
abject whether it's totally gonna rain
so like

1025
00:50:30,889 --> 00:50:34,089
can we close the window

1026
00:50:34,089 --> 00:50:35,279
and you see that

1027
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,089
the cost mary if that is a very harsh
there like yes sure go ahead

1028
00:50:39,089 --> 00:50:42,308
nelson you provided the benefit buyer
more valuable to the organization jazz

1029
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:44,159
even better

1030
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:47,559
opting to do the annoying csd tight
controls to because they have

1031
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:51,529
peacekeeping in some type of regiment

1032
00:50:51,529 --> 00:50:53,599
the way i like to do it is kind of

1033
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:58,599
go against a couple things that they
choose

1034
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:01,880
arrows any of you guys no record of the
stuff that i do but

1035
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,759
i liked messing with people more than
anything else that's like my favorite

1036
00:51:05,759 --> 00:51:09,099
exceed the speed right supercomputer on
your head and breaking that to me is

1037
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:12,159
more fun the brick systems

1038
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:14,140
well i'd like to go at it is

1039
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:17,900
are a few guys choose i'll give you some
things that we want to do and you give

1040
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,889
them the like fluffy magical

1041
00:51:19,889 --> 00:51:23,139
confidentiality integrity and
availability and it sounds old noble and

1042
00:51:23,139 --> 00:51:26,389
great they're like out and we want that

1043
00:51:26,389 --> 00:51:28,689
and then you see that they treat our
team

1044
00:51:28,689 --> 00:51:32,009
take the stuff that's important dollars
it just total charge tell me what's

1045
00:51:32,009 --> 00:51:34,519
important to the business and they go
okay cool

1046
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:35,379
say to that

1047
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,379
many rank them

1048
00:51:37,379 --> 00:51:40,808
anyway executives to august by the way
you've nothing to do it this year just

1049
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:43,999
like the starter for you just take the
notes

1050
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,879
at the end of the day

1051
00:51:45,879 --> 00:51:47,899
these are figuring out all walk cool

1052
00:51:47,899 --> 00:51:49,560
rates and services

1053
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,989
this is what we need to protect

1054
00:51:51,989 --> 00:51:56,299
this is what you're telling me the
businesses sat on the stomach to death

1055
00:51:56,299 --> 00:51:59,459
and this is what we need to protect and
they're like that's the suspense is what

1056
00:51:59,459 --> 00:52:01,999
the business isn't data for

1057
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:02,948
so

1058
00:52:02,949 --> 00:52:04,410
you make scores

1059
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:09,189
and that you say now what do you want to
protect you over to protect everything

1060
00:52:09,189 --> 00:52:10,749
here's the cost

1061
00:52:10,749 --> 00:52:15,578
joint to protect u_n_ above here's the
cost three above is the cost ford above

1062
00:52:15,579 --> 00:52:18,139
here's the cops fives

1063
00:52:18,139 --> 00:52:22,799
five supposed import so obviously you
have to protect that what those seat

1064
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:26,569
is that by protected five it costs x

1065
00:52:26,569 --> 00:52:31,939
biotech and five and four because x with
zero at the end of it

1066
00:52:31,939 --> 00:52:36,408
by protecting five four and three
because x with two zeros at the end of

1067
00:52:36,409 --> 00:52:37,659
it

1068
00:52:37,659 --> 00:52:41,269
any keep going down the chain and now
they start to understand because

1069
00:52:41,269 --> 00:52:42,879
you're not doing it

1070
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:49,859
they told you how to protect it you're
just trying to get facilitated

1071
00:52:49,859 --> 00:52:53,869
so at the very least you get funding for
protecting the five success they go

1072
00:52:53,869 --> 00:52:55,880
defies can kill them

1073
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:59,239
and that they have this constant nagging
it to the back of their head every time

1074
00:52:59,239 --> 00:53:01,729
that they go to bed at night

1075
00:53:01,729 --> 00:53:03,479
thinking

1076
00:53:03,479 --> 00:53:07,609
sheriff hold on to protect for two

1077
00:53:07,609 --> 00:53:09,179
armenian

1078
00:53:09,179 --> 00:53:13,979
configurable force it'll be just as bad
as a five

1079
00:53:13,979 --> 00:53:18,058
even if you do four point five fernanda
i think i can do to do some ass off to a

1080
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:19,440
little better so ghetto

1081
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,170
a couple months the light

1082
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:23,759
we got the five thing going to eat

1083
00:53:23,759 --> 00:53:27,130
well four point five so that may start
making the security program better for

1084
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:27,930
you

1085
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:29,839
because it just keeps that law

1086
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:33,808
knowing that people want to get hurt but
at the end of the decade

1087
00:53:33,809 --> 00:53:37,339
so this are forcing the security program
for you because it's based on the

1088
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:41,319
business because it's tied to the bottom
of the business

1089
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:44,699
is a really different way to protect
your business and buy a bunch of crap

1090
00:53:44,699 --> 00:53:46,959
put it on the perimeter and white

1091
00:53:46,959 --> 00:53:49,999
you know but we were pressed

1092
00:53:49,999 --> 00:53:51,288
right this is

1093
00:53:51,289 --> 00:53:55,879
this is what makes businesses operate

1094
00:53:55,879 --> 00:54:00,569
yeah i know its point

1095
00:54:00,569 --> 00:54:02,288
so this is why we have

1096
00:54:02,289 --> 00:54:03,979
you know also attackers

1097
00:54:03,979 --> 00:54:07,140
and thereby all sorts of build cars that
i can't bite as i don't make that much

1098
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,388
money 'cause

1099
00:54:08,389 --> 00:54:11,609
instead of breaking into things legally
i have to do it legally

1100
00:54:11,609 --> 00:54:16,939
and it's completely unfair

1101
00:54:16,939 --> 00:54:19,769
below the picture

1102
00:54:19,769 --> 00:54:22,819
because it's fair because

1103
00:54:22,819 --> 00:54:29,819
we just expect uses the clean up their
own shit

1104
00:54:30,679 --> 00:54:37,679
you guys because it in taiwan

1105
00:54:55,569 --> 00:54:58,379
what bill bilities of functional
attribute

1106
00:54:58,379 --> 00:55:02,459
by all means and it's and it's magically
comparable and you can't read all day

1107
00:55:02,459 --> 00:55:09,459
long

1108
00:55:15,369 --> 00:55:16,430
so so

1109
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:22,219
in anything or you have multiple factors
only one can be static

1110
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:25,129
allowed prospective tana controller
perspective

1111
00:55:25,129 --> 00:55:27,859
any of the other factors that can

1112
00:55:27,859 --> 00:55:28,999
applied

1113
00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:31,288
to that stacked factor increasing

1114
00:55:31,289 --> 00:55:35,109
and to become waiting mechanisms now
they're not been terrible forms of

1115
00:55:35,109 --> 00:55:38,719
transversal but they are waiting
mechanisms and if more blows waiting

1116
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:41,780
mechanisms apply now that availability

1117
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,270
the you can't read

1118
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:44,339
entrapped

1119
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:46,259
has to change

1120
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:48,589
right because you have additional waited
mechanisms

1121
00:55:48,589 --> 00:55:53,409
right because uh... we did organisms
usually can't be

1122
00:55:53,409 --> 00:55:55,169
they have to be done it

1123
00:55:55,169 --> 00:55:58,629
but the way that you titles waited
mechanisms back into it it is something

1124
00:55:58,629 --> 00:56:02,848
that uh... it honestly as possible as
blues it sounds

1125
00:56:02,849 --> 00:56:06,239
uh... because you have something solid
to offer from the base

1126
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:08,879
and that and that's really what this is
about because

1127
00:56:08,879 --> 00:56:12,639
your totally right when you say that
most security programs are found that on

1128
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:14,059
something that

1129
00:56:14,059 --> 00:56:15,670
you can't render track at all

1130
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:18,069
it's all hypothetical mumble jumble

1131
00:56:18,069 --> 00:56:20,989
all detainees are you still have stopped

1132
00:56:20,989 --> 00:56:24,329
and you're totally right but if you get
one thing that is

1133
00:56:24,329 --> 00:56:25,100
tractable

1134
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:28,049
then you can kind of progressively
activists

1135
00:56:28,049 --> 00:56:29,139
i guess that's

1136
00:56:29,139 --> 00:56:31,489
that that's the answer they have to it

1137
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:33,599
as scene work

1138
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:37,299
'cause other stuff until it would cement
it doesn't work it off because

1139
00:56:37,299 --> 00:56:39,059
there's no reason to do it

1140
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:40,679
so sub-zero

1141
00:56:40,679 --> 00:56:47,679
is education

1142
00:56:48,939 --> 00:56:53,038
well i think we teach people deception
this way

1143
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:58,269
instead of teaching people to set a
display

1144
00:56:58,269 --> 00:57:04,218
took a hill affidavits fine

1145
00:57:04,219 --> 00:57:08,159
everybody does it was actually has put
if you start learning it this way verses

1146
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:09,030
this way

1147
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:10,289
it's a different context

1148
00:57:10,289 --> 00:57:12,060
saving with the steady progress

1149
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:17,828
if if you weren't uh... you don't fight
words like this and not have castles

1150
00:57:17,829 --> 00:57:19,530
you don't have anything to lose

1151
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:21,249
by educating that way

1152
00:57:21,249 --> 00:57:23,138
you can all leading things

1153
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:26,559
bright light my understanding that even
though you're the superpower the

1154
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,979
guerrillas can still attack you

1155
00:57:28,979 --> 00:57:32,328
trying to identify how does tax with her

1156
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:35,820
isn't always the pure time because even
if they don't occur

1157
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:38,950
you four to five other areas of business
actually made it worse it just looks

1158
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:42,629
like the whole reason for s_c_l_c_ and
an ap testing right is

1159
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:48,039
is my application stays up processes
more parts per second x_y_z_

1160
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:49,919
by-product of that

1161
00:57:49,919 --> 00:57:52,538
ends up being the security function that
i'm going for

1162
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:56,089
and actually you security to drive the
functionality application to make the

1163
00:57:56,089 --> 00:57:58,328
occasion better even though

1164
00:57:58,329 --> 00:58:01,749
i was just trying to get a decent faster
more productive

1165
00:58:01,749 --> 00:58:07,089
but if i could do those together and now
have a new motivated

1166
00:58:07,089 --> 00:58:09,719
makes it a little

1167
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:14,909
more than the motel mobile should play a
pick stuff out hack don't stop

1168
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:21,909
cool beds all along

1169
00:58:23,879 --> 00:58:28,279
so yeah thats uh... un at the end of
that because that's exactly where i was

1170
00:58:28,279 --> 00:58:30,269
going with that is that

1171
00:58:30,269 --> 00:58:31,100
we've already gotten

1172
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:35,209
compromise so we can't be afraid of
getting compromised

1173
00:58:35,209 --> 00:58:36,259
so that's something

1174
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,960
because i think a lot of us build a
security programs around

1175
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,159
never getting hacked

1176
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:44,139
but i haven't been hacked yet i don't
want to be so i have to install the

1177
00:58:44,139 --> 00:58:45,649
scrap which

1178
00:58:45,649 --> 00:58:49,549
tear point is totally useless and it's
not a plan

1179
00:58:49,549 --> 00:58:54,538
right it's just overreacting to
something that you could gas

1180
00:58:54,539 --> 00:58:58,299
and nor do i start

1181
00:58:58,299 --> 00:58:58,920
sets

1182
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,859
debt that's really all

1183
00:59:00,859 --> 00:59:06,098
that i have to say about those six
arrowood what do you guys think is it

1184
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:10,479
mumbo jumbo and is that going the
pictures were funny

1185
00:59:10,479 --> 00:59:13,569
you is that i talked about packing stuff
from you

1186
00:59:13,569 --> 00:59:20,569
what what's your response so i don't i
don't know i'm not certain there

1187
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:33,170
my solution

1188
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:34,859
is hard work

1189
00:59:34,859 --> 00:59:37,529
at cape no one likes that solution
because it

1190
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:39,380
takes effort in time in

1191
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,770
they want to be skinny quickly instead
of light

1192
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:45,288
well in two years if you go to the gym
everyday eat right

1193
00:59:45,289 --> 00:59:47,249
you'll be pretty

1194
00:59:47,249 --> 00:59:50,618
rohit at overuse it that way it's hard
to flight

1195
00:59:50,619 --> 00:59:54,570
will there's no solution will i don't
want to be solution i want to be up

1196
00:59:54,570 --> 01:00:01,570
progress

1197
01:00:09,659 --> 01:00:16,659
solution

1198
01:00:19,099 --> 01:00:22,249
you you know i i think

1199
01:00:22,249 --> 01:00:23,759
purpose behind that

1200
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,279
is because

1201
01:00:25,279 --> 01:00:29,569
more back to the complexity thing is
that

1202
01:00:29,569 --> 01:00:32,349
a lot of times deep do you find

1203
01:00:32,349 --> 01:00:35,619
people don't do security things because
they think it's hard even though it

1204
01:00:35,619 --> 01:00:39,059
isn't

1205
01:00:39,059 --> 01:00:40,960
not quite sure on this

1206
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,179
than what you're asking uh...

1207
01:00:43,179 --> 01:00:44,309
did you find

1208
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:45,259
pushback

1209
01:00:45,259 --> 01:00:49,039
went when there's an obvious security
control they can get implemented that

1210
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:51,199
really isn't

1211
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:52,799
right if uh...

1212
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:54,939
borivali scanning

1213
01:00:54,939 --> 01:00:57,839
right you can have this ought to be a
thing to look for symbolic bilities

1214
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:01,089
and the people are like absolutely no
i'm not doing that because it might take

1215
01:01:01,089 --> 01:01:03,328
a box outside

1216
01:01:03,329 --> 01:01:07,080
and and you can plan for a do those
things we can make it kind of easier but

1217
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:11,959
but you get instant pushback because
people think it's hard

1218
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:13,138
world

1219
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:18,639
i think people have a tendency to want
to implement products over it using

1220
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:20,469
their experience and

1221
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:22,409
failures

1222
01:01:22,409 --> 01:01:25,649
i'd read and i i think that's why

1223
01:01:25,649 --> 01:01:27,808
i try and make some things

1224
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:30,299
purposely trivial because

1225
01:01:30,299 --> 01:01:34,059
maybe that'll open the opportunity to
somebody saying well may be doing this

1226
01:01:34,059 --> 01:01:37,109
stupid graph work thing

1227
01:01:37,109 --> 01:01:37,989
may help

1228
01:01:37,989 --> 01:01:41,420
and it's not his heart complicated as it
really

1229
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:44,919
with would seem before i get started

1230
01:01:44,919 --> 01:01:46,209
i can i'd like

1231
01:01:46,209 --> 01:01:48,239
the simplicity don't get me wrong

1232
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:49,240
but what ice

1233
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,459
find troublesome is that

1234
01:01:51,459 --> 01:01:54,769
i'd just don't think it's that easy to
demonstrate

1235
01:01:54,769 --> 01:01:56,249
your core business

1236
01:01:56,249 --> 01:01:58,919
your security stuff but leave it in

1237
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,339
and how they protect artist on

1238
01:02:01,339 --> 01:02:04,788
i haven't managed to see if i haven't
seen anyone do it

1239
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:06,909
appropriately and properly

1240
01:02:06,909 --> 01:02:10,959
which is why i would be interested to
see how you get that

1241
01:02:10,959 --> 01:02:12,779
scenario from next time

1242
01:02:12,779 --> 01:02:16,549
gives your scenario what you've done and
how you demonstrated absolutely and and

1243
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:18,299
in so thats

1244
01:02:18,299 --> 01:02:22,159
you're you're a bit any intent that i
had in giving this talk which is trying

1245
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:25,849
to get people to look at solutions that
aren't aware that we're doing things

1246
01:02:25,849 --> 01:02:28,389
right now

1247
01:02:28,389 --> 01:02:31,250
that is everything i could ever ask for
it is for somebody to go

1248
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:33,359
bullshit group

1249
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,509
and that's when i walk right

1250
01:02:35,509 --> 01:02:39,319
we've had sample should prove it over
and over again and then we'd get

1251
01:02:39,319 --> 01:02:40,490
like owns it

1252
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:41,928
and it doesn't prove it

1253
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:45,729
but that we do the things the same way
that we got high put this is not prove

1254
01:02:45,729 --> 01:02:48,038
it feel like you like

1255
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:49,819
systems and to get around

1256
01:02:49,819 --> 01:02:55,058
but we have to ignore that even existed
try another method

1257
01:02:55,059 --> 01:02:57,250
right on brother that's that's exactly
what

1258
01:02:57,250 --> 01:03:00,829
way what i can only hope for

1259
01:03:00,829 --> 01:03:02,689
i meet doing all those charts

1260
01:03:02,689 --> 01:03:05,879
it's one of those like stupid kind of
social things right

1261
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,049
that that security is a feeling

1262
01:03:08,049 --> 01:03:12,649
it's not aesthetic concept

1263
01:03:12,649 --> 01:03:17,299
so if you feel secure you you are
because the word security is a feeling

1264
01:03:17,299 --> 01:03:19,929
it's not it's not a measurable

1265
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:21,469
tax

1266
01:03:21,469 --> 01:03:24,319
and you can apply it to some measurable
things

1267
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:27,179
but really at the end of the day's
securities of feeling so how do you

1268
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:28,929
promote that feeling

1269
01:03:28,929 --> 01:03:33,279
both organically empirically in
environments and in the way is the type

1270
01:03:33,279 --> 01:03:35,439
of things that you're not concerned with

1271
01:03:35,439 --> 01:03:38,719
it's the types of things that's person
you're trying to preach it to is

1272
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:39,500
concerned with

1273
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,729
because if they get concerned about it

1274
01:03:41,729 --> 01:03:43,419
they're going to do things on their own

1275
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:46,359
if you're concerned about it for them
they're like oh don't worry curses

1276
01:03:46,359 --> 01:03:49,029
worried about it for me so i can't sleep
easy

1277
01:03:49,029 --> 01:03:52,039
but if you make it harder for them sleep
they're gonna they're gonna start doing

1278
01:03:52,039 --> 01:03:55,019
things on their own state they can feel
better

1279
01:03:55,019 --> 01:03:58,368
and that's what we want to do we what we
want other people doing the job to

1280
01:03:58,369 --> 01:03:59,510
distribute the load

1281
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:02,099
so that we're not trying to lift the
whole organization up to the

1282
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:03,690
organization slipping itself

1283
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:09,649
and we get the two nd summer components
as a goes along

1284
01:04:09,649 --> 01:04:10,868
hopefully alice

1285
01:04:10,869 --> 01:04:14,039
not hurting a little bit by surprise
here are usually people don't start

1286
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:17,600
asking questions are usually have to go
on stage and help them

1287
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:21,348
but first research discovers a an
exception here

1288
01:04:21,349 --> 01:04:22,359
uh...

1289
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,779
also i use it i think it impresses
myself just get people started this

1290
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:29,019
mission the morning that's that's we
think that i could think those lisa

1291
01:04:29,019 --> 01:04:34,519
rivera work against a uh... possessor
been coming back to this trade

1292
01:04:34,519 --> 01:04:35,988
oregon state a

1293
01:04:35,989 --> 01:04:39,709
a guerilla force that actually made it
back to you

1294
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,269
you know what so

1295
01:04:41,269 --> 01:04:44,269
because of what's is guerrilla forces

1296
01:04:44,269 --> 01:04:46,459
since they're kind of too centralized

1297
01:04:46,459 --> 01:04:48,459
never never really went right through it

1298
01:04:48,459 --> 01:04:51,348
they'd never went and took over all the
ottoman empire because that was in

1299
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:51,940
trouble

1300
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:55,809
their goal was i did anybody ever be

1301
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,210
beaker rosetti trails

1302
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:58,789
what yeah

1303
01:04:58,789 --> 01:05:01,399
but when you beat them they had nothing
to lose

1304
01:05:01,399 --> 01:05:02,649
right so it's

1305
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:06,129
it's if i get into a fight over
territory but i will not concerned with

1306
01:05:06,129 --> 01:05:07,699
taking the territory

1307
01:05:07,699 --> 01:05:11,180
that even if i lose my job was to stick
into a fight

1308
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:15,080
and i was successfully by lost i was so
successful you have to fight check a box

1309
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:16,729
cool about

1310
01:05:16,729 --> 01:05:18,279
whether whether or not

1311
01:05:18,279 --> 01:05:21,159
ends up becoming an arbitrary sense at
the end of the

1312
01:05:21,159 --> 01:05:22,170
so to spend the

1313
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:25,599
the fun part about about those types of
warfare right width

1314
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:28,539
i mean you can go attack a whole bunch
of stuff of the internet and do you get

1315
01:05:28,539 --> 01:05:32,299
to give yourself the thumbs up just as
your attacking

1316
01:05:32,299 --> 01:05:33,469
so thats

1317
01:05:33,469 --> 01:05:37,299
it's an awesome question because the
addy they lose all the time because like

1318
01:05:37,299 --> 01:05:40,899
you know the pulley came images burned
down fifty pounds and killed everybody

1319
01:05:40,899 --> 01:05:42,019
in

1320
01:05:42,019 --> 01:05:44,399
elise wahl is not always believed that

1321
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:48,759
rec you know the the fighting stops
mistakes like five years

1322
01:05:48,759 --> 01:05:49,869
correct it be

1323
01:05:49,869 --> 01:05:53,079
punitive movies made about how you drink
blood

1324
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:54,479
uh...

1325
01:05:54,479 --> 01:05:55,700
anymore actually cut off

1326
01:05:55,700 --> 01:06:01,249
whereabouts beside let me come down with
mike

1327
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:02,888
like picking fights by the way

1328
01:06:02,889 --> 01:06:06,279
flouted some progress like i don't
actually believed everything that i say

1329
01:06:06,279 --> 01:06:09,289
i just pick fights on purpose

1330
01:06:09,289 --> 01:06:11,649
strategies very

1331
01:06:11,649 --> 01:06:13,719
fantastic

1332
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:15,689
should we be issued mean

1333
01:06:15,689 --> 01:06:17,828
extract agent olson

1334
01:06:17,829 --> 01:06:20,209
from whom uwi protecting stuff

1335
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:24,999
how do we determine that should be just
think of the chinese since the attackers

1336
01:06:24,999 --> 01:06:28,459
novel is that the superpower with
protecting ourselves from the coast

1337
01:06:28,459 --> 01:06:34,229
again coming back to the correlation to
his hangup artful investments you know

1338
01:06:34,229 --> 01:06:38,640
if i'm protecting against fred the next
door and wireless

1339
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,308
hacker gaya

1340
01:06:40,309 --> 01:06:44,609
okay up put on some encryption room

1341
01:06:44,609 --> 01:06:48,199
decimals percentages of the battlefield
in order to identify how you're going to

1342
01:06:48,199 --> 01:06:50,249
respond

1343
01:06:50,249 --> 01:06:54,919
wednesday internet it seems like that's
the whole battlefield in the superpowers

1344
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,940
as powerful issue next door neighbor in
some way

1345
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:59,059
absolutely wrong

1346
01:06:59,059 --> 01:07:01,420
it's that relevant should we care about
that

1347
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:02,849
threat agent

1348
01:07:02,849 --> 01:07:06,629
yet you know so

1349
01:07:06,629 --> 01:07:11,379
you obviously do some of the fair and
various suffering

1350
01:07:11,379 --> 01:07:15,390
as far as strategy frameworks

1351
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:19,900
various is a risk formulation yet by the
the rocks and hug

1352
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,369
uh... here so

1353
01:07:21,369 --> 01:07:23,319
and then the fair

1354
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:24,429
uh...

1355
01:07:24,429 --> 01:07:28,149
scoring mechanisms also have to throw a
gps

1356
01:07:28,149 --> 01:07:32,368
every time i've ever gone into the
conversation with jack who made fair or

1357
01:07:32,369 --> 01:07:35,559
alex who made uh... various

1358
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:39,329
the one thing that they still haven't
been able to respond to me on

1359
01:07:39,329 --> 01:07:41,649
and i'm waiting for visas that are just

1360
01:07:41,649 --> 01:07:43,719
declare defeat and his lamp

1361
01:07:43,719 --> 01:07:46,119
hall but until then i would stay
vigilant

1362
01:07:46,119 --> 01:07:47,189
is that

1363
01:07:47,189 --> 01:07:50,618
timmy threat doesn't matter hasn't agent

1364
01:07:50,619 --> 01:07:53,419
unless the agent has intent

1365
01:07:53,419 --> 01:07:57,999
and unless you can derive with the
intent of that aging is anything you do

1366
01:07:57,999 --> 01:08:00,999
against the threat agent is a guess

1367
01:08:00,999 --> 01:08:03,859
and you've wind up in the same circle

1368
01:08:03,859 --> 01:08:05,078
because

1369
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:10,509
maybe my neighbor broke into my wifi but
he doesn't have the intent to hurt me

1370
01:08:10,509 --> 01:08:12,789
does it hurt me

1371
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:15,499
because he didn't have the intent of her

1372
01:08:15,499 --> 01:08:16,759
and it if

1373
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:19,390
if somebody has the intent but doesn't
have the skill

1374
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:22,950
although i could start trying to
identify the saint sophia we had the all

1375
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:26,729
knowing i a we could see everything and
everyone is everywhere we could start

1376
01:08:26,729 --> 01:08:29,948
identifying capabilities verses intent

1377
01:08:29,948 --> 01:08:35,078
and derive the threat agents logical
nature of being able to exercise an

1378
01:08:35,078 --> 01:08:36,589
attack that can hurt me

1379
01:08:36,589 --> 01:08:40,390
but until we get some of those types of
things where were intent can really be

1380
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:42,920
derived i still

1381
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:46,658
honestly believe that we're just
guessing

1382
01:08:46,658 --> 01:08:48,919
i agree

1383
01:08:48,919 --> 01:08:52,658
yet we need to make sono we need to just
watch everybody i guess i hate that

1384
01:08:52,658 --> 01:08:55,509
though let's just screwed up

1385
01:08:55,509 --> 01:08:58,819
and i think a comment to the puzzle so
that we don't know

1386
01:08:58,819 --> 01:09:01,380
the pieces business value or

1387
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:04,759
these nations that we should protect
manish

1388
01:09:04,759 --> 01:09:08,019
situations is also it gets

1389
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:12,629
i too agree talking i think that's a
wall of the biggest models that will

1390
01:09:12,629 --> 01:09:14,630
trying to secure something that

1391
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:16,589
is we have a big question mark

1392
01:09:16,589 --> 01:09:19,368
mean what the next actually wide

1393
01:09:19,368 --> 01:09:21,339
hi i state that problem

1394
01:09:21,339 --> 01:09:23,540
by transferring it to the executives

1395
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:26,939
dated a business owners it's like a hero
in the business school being you know

1396
01:09:26,939 --> 01:09:28,109
what's important

1397
01:09:28,109 --> 01:09:29,728
not my job

1398
01:09:29,729 --> 01:09:33,399
eddie n yeah that's a cop out way to do
it but related to the day they're the

1399
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:36,839
ones who should know if they don't know
if you know it's their bad not mine

1400
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,229
but but i think we need

1401
01:09:38,229 --> 01:09:42,790
who booklets onto security information
skip it shouldn't try to help them home

1402
01:09:42,790 --> 01:09:45,729
with her decission on

1403
01:09:45,729 --> 01:09:47,169
owner collaboration

1404
01:09:47,169 --> 01:09:48,979
what should you look for

1405
01:09:48,979 --> 01:09:50,759
to protect

1406
01:09:50,759 --> 01:09:53,339
yet it connects cutaway like they do
that

1407
01:09:53,339 --> 01:09:55,010
stevedore matrix thang

1408
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:58,690
is because they can give me the factors
in that i can make scenarios that like

1409
01:09:58,690 --> 01:10:01,710
i_t_t_ shady eye in the background death

1410
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:02,749
it you know the

1411
01:10:02,749 --> 01:10:05,809
whatever you do this if you ever try and
do this deal come into the conversation

1412
01:10:05,809 --> 01:10:07,409
about email

1413
01:10:07,409 --> 01:10:09,919
immediately emails all high

1414
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:12,760
and you like ok we'll check it out

1415
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:17,750
let's say email went down today and it
was never coming back

1416
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:21,260
maybe later let we're screwed like i
always so it's clear that we completely

1417
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:22,510
go out of business

1418
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:26,070
so i can only offense to the parade
today like we find a way around it and

1419
01:10:26,070 --> 01:10:29,409
what do we start telephones you know if
we call people

1420
01:10:29,409 --> 01:10:32,079
three actually like to meet them in
person

1421
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:33,880
and then the high starts like

1422
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:37,680
coming down to medium and eventually it
gets down below and people are like all

1423
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:40,850
we had you know it's just that thing
that we rely on that we don't really

1424
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:42,250
need

1425
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:44,079
but having that conversation

1426
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:47,119
it's it it's like going to risk their
api session for

1427
01:10:47,119 --> 01:10:50,919
for solubilized yet i realize that their
alcoholic in the middle of the director

1428
01:10:50,919 --> 01:10:55,429
like old d_n_a_ inadequate acutely those
doing that

1429

um... well i i guess uh...

1442
01:11:33,239 --> 01:11:37,678
most of what you're saying is uh... then
agree that we do this to be wrong

1443
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:41,760
and and that's what we're trying to do
here at this conference will the we use

1444
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,690
proposing is uh...

1445
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:46,949
the moral sales

1446
01:11:46,949 --> 01:11:50,460
than actually less on security and more
of saints

1447
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:52,090
from the security apartment

1448
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:53,530
the

1449
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:55,370
how do you do that how do you become
uh...

1450
01:11:55,370 --> 01:11:59,989
salesperson rather than a tradition
inside me

1451
01:11:59,989 --> 01:12:02,638
probably selling a feeling

1452
01:12:02,639 --> 01:12:05,719
with every box with every packet that we
defend

1453
01:12:05,719 --> 01:12:08,189
aren't we going

1454
01:12:08,189 --> 01:12:10,560
had received your ass

1455
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,239
you owe me

1456
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:15,480
uh... weeding impact in a row i found
this but i was wishing a very clear it

1457
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,709
before it does were i mean

1458
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:21,360
where they could please sales because
our whole jobs about feelings

1459
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,518
it's just we have to except some of
those

1460
01:12:24,519 --> 01:12:27,570
this is this is one of those like i hope
people can accept the job that they're

1461
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:28,090
in

1462
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:31,330
verses pretend that they can sit behind
their keys all they have actually make

1463
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:32,370
the difference

1464
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:35,729
that the difference comes when you get a
wrecked with somebody it doesn't come

1465
01:12:35,729 --> 01:12:39,300
when you stop the packet it comes when
the business knows the packet that

1466
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:42,499
stopping could have hurt them

1467
01:12:42,499 --> 01:12:45,349
cellular and connection difficult to get

1468
01:12:45,349 --> 01:12:46,619
so its peak

1469
01:12:46,619 --> 01:12:49,780
it's more that you know get out of the
basement and talk to people because then

1470
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:51,999
the value will be felt

1471
01:12:51,999 --> 01:12:55,228
benefits phelps were accomplishing our
mission of making people
