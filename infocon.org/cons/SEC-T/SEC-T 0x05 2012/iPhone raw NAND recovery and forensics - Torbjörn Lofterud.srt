what do you see

1037
00:57:07,069 --> 00:57:09,808
addition is that

1038
00:57:09,809 --> 00:57:10,929

01:10:38,379 --> 01:10:40,349
the possibility of it

1277
01:10:40,349 --> 01:10:43,439
which are also uh... you

1278
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:46,019
zeros in colorado

1279
01:10:46,019 --> 01:10:48,590

1282
01:10:55,219 --> 01:10:56,780
self-interest

1283
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:58,929
and so i don't know who's going to start

1284
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:01,659
tromping through that but that in most
cases

1285
01:11:01,659 --> 01:11:04,789
don't know what

1286
01:11:04,789 --> 01:11:10,860
sparked

1287
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:14,610
detroit's two

issues here is the mob

1289
01:11:20,579 --> 01:11:21,929
minus the annoying

1290
01:11:21,929 --> 01:11:22,989
using version

1291
01:11:22,989 --> 01:11:24,539
recent meeting thursday

1292

if you had used a is funny sounds
innocent lights or or

1294
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:36,239
minus the war

1295
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:38,049
and the reason for that

1296
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:39,639
is useful work

1297
01:11:39,639 --> 01:11:44,039

empirical data thirty times or always
last

1302
01:11:56,279 --> 01:11:59,389
