328
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,250
tools say okay

329
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,920
and all the justified prime it not going
to

330
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,569
to be outdated

331

00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,690
that means that they'll just be we
created this they have pedophile is

335
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:25,630
supper finally if anchorman index down
because his for us

336

and that we are indexing injecting in

342
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:43,689
his

343
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:44,810
something like this

344
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,968
the only uh... we are

345
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:50,599
and reporting the u_n_ tool with a
controlled by mail and

346
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:53,400
the idea is that and

347
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,530
dyads

348
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,850
and

349
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,050
we got here we are doing project

350

doesn't days that in all anyone website
july infecting the friend l escape so

351
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,559

to do it again dot staying they only
treat that we are going through

354
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,660
and that's all

355
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,699
once you finish school configured a
brick at your practice every to have to

356
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,520
create ana bizet

374
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,470
then we got the box itself that then we
go out without the power

375
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,340
mare by p dot s

376
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,909
on our part

internet though it's muggy

383
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,860
and the i_p_r_ there's washing one
thousand one hundred ten

00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,270
different sites because or practice
their bellies

ones dot door idea is to be a spotless
on on band practice have at least

390
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,860
the day after juggling to hop on a lot
of people

391
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,550
connecting to your proxy set rat and

392
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,149
and requesting justifies

393
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:23,748
through with the brooks' severed so we
created signed a special payloads

394
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:26,010
bracing for bailouts the first one

395
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,129
yeah cycle pius the limb but not

396
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:33,210
we waited and worried about and insecure
book isn't there a way that we will end

397
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,060
there where where we went what it's
about a fifty to be only that's not my

398
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,120
pockets

399
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,018
apart we created this as more javascript

400
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,240
fun sound too

401
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,350
and hope

402
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:49,570
on ant farm fields honesty law the
daytime form fill a solid idea is that

403
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,649
and with these funds and we have hooking
this apne event

404
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:57,809
so anythign now sobbing the band is
produced in our uniform

405
00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:00,010
these alice k_ file is going to go up b

406
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,550
on dole all information i mean

407
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,340
in have fought the list and send it

send them to their

409
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,720
send it to the contraband

410
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,749
the idea is that

411
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:14,030
they are being from an thousands and
thousands and thousands of web site

412

beatty

414
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,900
and dottie connecting to one h_t_t_p_
yes

415
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,510
and their program

416
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,350
biting the h_t_t_p_

417

japan as field all uh... do sum a
mombasa worked uh...

418
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,090
that's all

419
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:35,230
only doing this if we were able to
happen

420
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:40,200
four thousand and um... anand know how
many hundreds

421
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,550

sudip resumes

423
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,120

through their practice event

683
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,779

954
00:46:56,719 --> 00:47:00,299
some traffic to do with it

955
00:47:00,299 --> 00:47:05,229

961
00:47:28,389 --> 00:47:33,709
the other thing is not rally mostly do i

the house on a specialized and unsecured
optional i'd days they are not checking

1004
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,239
out all did

1009
00:49:46,499 --> 00:49:48,839
dot what you'll be p p

1010
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:52,409
bit more while it's going to connect all
to marketing to the wifi so it's quite

1011
00:49:52,409 --> 00:49:53,589
simple to

1012
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:58,078
to put those banning you now wifi
connection how come i think

1013
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,030
even taken into account that the peace
almost impossible to believe

1014
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:07,039
apres disconnected wifi you do i do
seemed i'd always trying to connect that

1015
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:09,519
one day in a hotel in the states

1016
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:14,680
i'm judy dean based dot made were when
you were deregulated ending the state

1017
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,319
most of that wifi dot wifi

1018
00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:21,880
will be remaining to him alive forever
is simple to atividades dot wifi

1019
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,380
so any wifi with the same name

1020
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,370
jeremiah will connect altamonte doing

1021
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:29,118
so they can impair all these practices

destroyed your diplomacy nonchalant and
of course they can talk on dot built on

1047
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,469
the

00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:11,479
thanks for confirming here young loaded
questions so i guess in person

1054
00:52:11,479 --> 00:52:18,479
lies in the thing working

1055
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:29,939
although the other one

1056
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,479
this is a layers as i was talking and
uh... you still insists there is art but

1057
00:52:35,479 --> 00:52:37,779
it's also very serious

1058
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:44,779
for small business practice dot

1059
00:52:48,849 --> 00:52:53,609
you know the practices the lab by the
way it seems the board still that the

1060
00:52:53,609 --> 00:52:57,339
practice ever which has taught us on the
internet is not working right now

1061
00:52:57,339 --> 00:52:58,859
one with

1062
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:03,449
when we were doing the des moines black
ops and today after sound one party said

1063
00:53:03,449 --> 00:53:08,109
that he liked the i_r_s_ and there we
and in the next the mowing desk on we

1064
00:53:08,109 --> 00:53:09,730
got one thousand

1065
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:15,839
bolts and uh... we decide not to so that
the beloved by that they think that the

1066
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,808
armed song well

1067
00:53:17,809 --> 00:53:19,959
policy when you do you make in this
party

1068
00:53:19,959 --> 00:53:20,928
okay

1069
00:53:20,929 --> 00:53:26,229
sunny and it's about at that

1070
00:53:26,229 --> 00:53:28,959
knows there's one is there's no time did

1071
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,308
versed alarming is very cheap very

1072
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:35,299
important to understand that it actually
would remain in your cash

1073
00:53:35,299 --> 00:53:38,679
uh... it will still be running you move
your system onto some you know some of

1074
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:40,619
the network

1075
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:43,509
you you you take it to your car
corporate network

1076
00:53:43,509 --> 00:53:47,159
thus things still running is still
stealing stuff from your internal at

1077
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:49,079
work and now and

1078
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:52,279
it's very important to stress that's
that's what i understand it the the

1079
00:53:52,279 --> 00:53:56,539
brain is that after publishing this idea
of the number of proxy back-up beer on

1080
00:53:56,539 --> 00:53:59,279
the internet increase about with his
outlook

1081
00:53:59,279 --> 00:54:03,109
the problem is that it's very easy to to
create these it's on a

1082
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:07,610
property discrete proxy so comfy rates
and in in in napa t

1083
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:12,010
won a small piece of code that cody spot
is on the way tapered bed with autism

1084
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:14,049
blackout

1085
00:54:14,049 --> 00:54:17,219
anyone conduits and a lot of people are
doing it in that

1086
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:19,689
also you don't really need the proxy i
mean

1087
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:23,689
proj is good for infecting a lot of
people that have places but a wifi let's

1088
00:54:23,689 --> 00:54:24,808
just enough

1089
00:54:24,809 --> 00:54:26,979
for a place like this accepted

1090
00:54:26,979 --> 00:54:31,328
that these these jobs as well as it's
not the man in the middle

1091
00:54:31,329 --> 00:54:35,139
and i can be done several different ways
of that that and that with finals of

1092
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:36,879
this out back is that

1093
00:54:36,879 --> 00:54:38,339
is is

1094
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:42,999
so simple to grade the dallas good that
for aunty viruses they means in almost

1095
00:54:42,999 --> 00:54:45,770
impossible to that that day infection
five

1096
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:50,469
because anyone of dupont greddy friend
asked if i did so

1097
00:54:50,469 --> 00:54:54,379
do you know how the anti virus is that
he's going to that date weekday what

1098
00:54:54,379 --> 00:54:58,629
funds dallas defines the on we think
that javascript five is some virus are

1099
00:54:58,629 --> 00:54:59,519
not

1100
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:04,149
if they tried to to that that doubts
dallas define sending the dow testified

1101
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:08,390
they would probably freddie hopped a lot
of folks uh... false-positive found they

1102
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:12,038
will have a lot of program with clients
customers alone so it's almost

1103
00:55:12,039 --> 00:55:15,909
impossible to that that these this
attack

1104
00:55:15,909 --> 00:55:17,650
so id is a serious

1105
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:21,239
it is a serious problem as well as in
this relief really fucking funny

1106
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:28,059
uh... questions from the audience

1107
00:55:28,059 --> 00:55:31,380
yeah house soon cigarette if you know
