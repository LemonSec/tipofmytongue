00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,200
but it's almost like

189
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,450
where outside

190
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,500

00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,880
for example walsh application

197
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,939
but and use the four

198
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,460

well i don't know if there was no
outsiders

202
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:25,199
so i guess there are n c progresses

203
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,010
unanimity

204
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,830
or arrangements

205
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,720
and that it might have to accept it

206
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,250
usually the

207
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,900
resumes to

208
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,699

216
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,670
i don't settle for that

217
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,660
the commercial interests
