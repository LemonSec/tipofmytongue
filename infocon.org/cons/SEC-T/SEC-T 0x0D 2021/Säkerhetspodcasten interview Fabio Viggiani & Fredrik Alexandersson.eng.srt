1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,120
so we are live here from sexy 2021 uh

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,240
stuck and fabio just came off stage uh

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,400
giving an excellent talk about some

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,079
threat hunting they've been doing some

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,199
tools you

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,600
developed to figure out how to

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,160
be a little bit ahead of the bad guys

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,560
right yeah right and maybe a little bit

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,359
about how to be the bad guys or

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,359
it's all of them right yeah that's it it

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,159
can't just be all defense right we

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,559
everybody likes to hack stuff but

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,559
what i love about this whole thing that

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,960
we presented today which was

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,800
um

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,120
responsive incident response right is

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,360
that that's redeeming reverse because

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,120
you need to understand all the offensive

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,440
tools being used and if you are a good

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,600
red teamer it's going to feel natural

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,039
for you when you're doing the whole

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,800
incident response thing because you

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,680
identify patterns and it's like reading

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,239
redacted reports that somebody wrote up

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,920
and you can see what happens so i think

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,120
it's really interesting

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,879
yeah and we have the luxury to have both

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,880
red teamers and blue teamers into

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,720
instant responders that

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,479
help doing this with this you know

31
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,560
handling these cases and it's always

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,560
nice to have a red team or perspective

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,920
when you try to figure out what an

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,080
actual cyber criminal did because then

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,280
you can think you know from their

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,360
perspective like if i were there i had

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,200
this type of access i was in this system

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,439
and my goal was that how would i do it

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,799
and then you can check is that how they

40
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,640
actually did it or not and it actually

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,079
helps a lot yeah

42
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,600
and the other way around as well right

43
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,280
what we learned from incident response

44
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,360
you can apply into your own red teaming

45
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,200
because if you know how to find stuff

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,880
you also know how to not be found

47
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,479
exactly and i think

48
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,640
also to be a good red teamer it helps if

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,280
you work blue team yeah because you you

50
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,079
know where where sys admins get sloppy

51
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,680
and where they uh

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,759
sort of take shortcuts and things like

53
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,159
that so uh yeah yeah it all ties

54
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,840
together i think it's a good good idea

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,240
to have um to have both sides of the of

56
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,799
the house represented in some response

57
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,000
yeah

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,880
yeah

59
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,719
i would not i would throw it to the mix

60
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,880
also the monitoring and the sock yeah

61
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,360
because they actually do the the

62
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,760
detection and quick response right so

63
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,120
they are the one like setting the rules

64
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,000
for what to check for uh and uh and

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,400
alerting and reacting to that so should

66
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,440
the uh sock people also go into the red

67
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,800
teaming

68
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,840
i think that's awesome and we have

69
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,440
people from our sock that move into pen

70
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,239
testing and red teaming

71
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:28,959
so

72
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,160
i think that's the best the more

73
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,760
perspectives you can get

74
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,840
and the more you act

75
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,040
uh

76
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,959
effectively yeah

77
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,440
i think for for me one one of the things

78
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,760
i i've worked uh a lot of incident

79
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,040
response and worked in forensics uh uh

80
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,319
in in the before times uh but one thing

81
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,560
i liked about your talk was that you did

82
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,440
the analogy about you know a jigsaw

83
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,760
puzzle that you have to find little

84
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,480
pieces and and and it might you might

85
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,879
not even have all the pieces but it

86
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,440
somehow creates a picture and and you're

87
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,720
you're

88
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,040
keeping that timeline as basically a

89
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,280
security blanket that you're you're

90
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,200
attaching everything to and try to

91
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,519
correlate things so

92
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,400
i i really enjoyed that that's

93
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,480
i am what what do you think i mean you

94
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,959
guys developed tools to to sort of

95
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,680
build into that but but do you think

96
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,200
there should be

97
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,610
like with you discussed in the talk um

98
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,799
[Music]

99
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,959
microsoft's uh

100
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,680
cache for uh remote desktop

101
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,440
do you think that software companies

102
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,840
like microsoft should be more

103
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,319
in terms of helpful in terms of creating

104
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,959
tools to to use that as incident

105
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,319
response or should that be thwarted by

106
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,239
or

107
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,080
i think uh yes ideally yes uh but i mean

108
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,760
if i'm trying to look from from their

109
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,840
perspective uh

110
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
they of course want to work with giving

111
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,400
possibility to detect and possibly even

112
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,000
block stuff right and they do it in

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,760
their way you know they push the new

114
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,400
solutions and all the you know the new

115
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,720
fancy solutions they have

116
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,959
uh which which you know they're usually

117
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,439
good you know they do the right things

118
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,040
provided that you are in a modern

119
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,399
environment and that you have other

120
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,399
things in place it doesn't make sense to

121
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,918
use the latest and greatest if you don't

122
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,000
even do the basics right but here we're

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,680
talking about missing the basics and

124
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,759
this is the stuff we're left with so i

125
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,000
don't know yes it would be great to have

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,320
but i i don't see that there is

127
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,560
huge value for a company like microsoft

128
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,800
to do that then again they they are

129
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,560
sometimes very transparent sometimes not

130
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,680
because

131
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,440
but they have tools like you know

132
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,600
autoruns and all this stuff anyway like

133
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,520
yeah i mean that's just internals that's

134
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,280
you know it's it's microsoft yeah it's a

135
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,880
part of microsoft that does those

136
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,080
they could probably just create one

137
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,280
that's the rdp cache explorer

138
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,000
sure right sure in theory and yeah

139
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
i mean it's possible it's gonna come up

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,160
like but uh in theory they will start to

141
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,880
use the captchas as do the puzzling from

142
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,199
the repeat cache to show that you're

143
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,120
human right yeah you guys can be a great

144
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,199
idea

145
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,960
do that can you figure out how to sort

146
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,479
my mccasting this

147
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,720
or a hydra or whatever wow awesome great

148
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,240
idea

149
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,120
you're happy to explore that one perfect

150
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,720
one thing that i picked up on your talk

151
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,960
was all the different tactics and

152
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,360
technologies that you showed up was a

153
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,479
way of disguising your actual attack

154
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,039
towards the responders right throw away

155
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,360
some some stupid error message that that

156
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,880
will make

157
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,240
the incident responders stop yeah and

158
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,320
look another way oh this is just a

159
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,560
phishing attack or this is just this and

160
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,360
that

161
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,680
but but how common would you say it is

162
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,400
that

163
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,039
someone goes in goes after data and then

164
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,600
throws out some bitcoin miner just to

165
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,080
see that oh the instant responder oh

166
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,639
it's a just bitcoin miner or a monero

167
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,360
miner person that's after us do you have

168
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,880
any data on that

169
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,199
i don't have anything on my head but i

170
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,479
don't think that's very common among

171
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,360
criminal groups uh it is more common

172
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,000
when you have an apt

173
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,240
that actually has

174
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,600
you know they have a lot of resources

175
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,960
they have time

176
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,479
and they can actually do this and they

177
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,520
actually have value in doing that

178
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,600
but

179
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,240
but it would be quite easy just to throw

180
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,319
up something for sure it would but it

181
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,160
also tells you that it's important to do

182
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
with our investigation yeah so when do

183
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,319
you stop investigating

184
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,240
when you're ready to do a full

185
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,759
kick out and

186
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,600
you have a plan for how you were

187
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,039
building yeah because that's the thing

188
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,159
when you want to do a kickout

189
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,240
you need to make sure you do all the

190
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,400
things you need to do at once right say

191
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,960
you have x number of systems compromised

192
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,759
and

193
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,400
there's back doors talking to servers

194
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,880
you know thread after servers

195
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,280
their accounts are compromised

196
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,880
then you know okay i need to clean that

197
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,680
server i need to block

198
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,440
i need to block those ips in the

199
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,720
firewall and i need to reset the

200
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,880
passwords for these accounts and they

201
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,720
came in through rdp for example so we

202
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
need to close rdp so they can come back

203
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,880
in the same way and so on so all these

204
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,800
things you need to have found them all

205
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,039
ideally so you can do them at the same

206
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,800
time because if you do one but you need

207
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,759
the other they're gonna figure out

208
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,280
that you're doing that and then they're

209
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,199
gonna hide differently it doesn't really

210
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,039
apply for ransomware cases so much

211
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,960
because you know obviously you've

212
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,400
noticed

213
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,560
your is

214
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,160
so then they know of course there's

215
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,360
going to be an investigation they're not

216
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,000
really in in most cases i guess they

217
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,400
could be but but um

218
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,000
that's more for targeted attacks that

219
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,919
are not ransomware

220
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,120
then you really want to make sure you

221
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,479
find everything before you do the kick

222
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,879
out yeah and that that takes time and i

223
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,400
don't know how it depends how complex

224
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,120
the environment is and how advanced and

225
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
extended the attack is

226
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,720
it's easy to say also that you probably

227
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,960
just change the passwords right but you

228
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,479
need to change

229
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,000
all the passwords everything all the

230
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,720
time

231
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,639
at the same time right yeah at the same

232
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,479
time and then you need to have another

233
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,400
cleaned domain where you can start

234
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,000
working with and you know this is

235
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,680
complex stuff and you have people

236
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,520
working trying to take care of stuff

237
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,199
trying to do what they're doing customer

238
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,039
is stressed all the time right and

239
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,720
asking you when when can we start doing

240
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,400
this then losing money by the minute

241
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,360
yeah and so that's also the thing that i

242
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,199
love about doing this work is that when

243
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,759
you enter an incident

244
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,680
in the first stages if it isn't around

245
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,840
somewhere you are

246
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,919
you're getting called in adrenaline is

247
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,679
pumping you're starting to figure things

248
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,120
out and you're

249
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,719
and you know the threat actor is in the

250
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,880
system and you need to figure out how

251
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,519
did they get in and which and how do we

252
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,159
stop them because the system can be

253
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,320
around somewhere at any second because

254
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,080
they don't know you're there so you need

255
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,839
to be stealthy as well doing the

256
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,560
research you can't just start a bunch of

257
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,040
new user accounts in the main naming

258
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,920
them your company consultant one because

259
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,760
that's gonna flag them so you need to

260
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,160
stealth that look what's going on and

261
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,160
then eventually figure out like do we

262
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,720
have backups are we create are we ready

263
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,760
so we don't get that vengeance around

264
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,040
somewhere where there is one yeah

265
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,760
exactly then they do things uh you know

266
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,680
quickly yeah like you know the phases

267
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,880
are usually you take over the entire

268
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,560
infrastructure first then you go after

269
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,120
data uh it usually takes a while to find

270
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,880
the right data and then you steal that

271
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,480
so you have the additional leverage when

272
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,480
you do the ransomware

273
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,959
uh and uh and then you destroy backups

274
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,000
they usually also like uninstall uh av

275
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,600
centrally if it's a group policy or

276
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,040
whatever they just push it out and then

277
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,320
they do the run somewhere ever at the

278
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,640
same time if for example if you catch

279
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,480
them in the middle phase there when they

280
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,320
already have a lot of access

281
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,720
uh but they're still you know they still

282
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,480
need to go through data to steal and

283
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,399
stuff like that and find the backups and

284
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,839
they see that you're on to them they're

285
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,519
probably going to be kicked out any

286
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,120
minute now

287
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,560
you know the quick reaction could be

288
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,640
well okay forget the backups and the

289
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,040
data just

290
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,839
so so that's a very bad spot to find

291
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,920
them or to at least let them know that

292
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,240
you found them how common would you say

293
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,000
is that they go after the backups and

294
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,200
crash that

295
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,760
all the time pretty much also that like

296
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,240
you could go persistent and

297
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,640
just encrypt the backups right

298
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,200
so during half a year you start doing

299
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,000
the

300
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,600
encryption of the backup when you do

301
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,000
read back you do that decryption

302
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,920
so you don't see that there is a problem

303
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,800
yeah

304
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,640
and then you drop the key

305
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,880
i see that but then it's easier to wipe

306
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
them and do the brass markings yeah but

307
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,560
then but then you would recognize that

308
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,399
right and then you have that your

309
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,560
off-site yeah okay if you have actual

310
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,800
off-site and offline backups yeah that's

311
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,839
true fair enough uh and it's definitely

312
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,040
something that could

313
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,880
potentially be done but it's very

314
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,720
interesting i'm just going to say

315
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,360
they are so successful already

316
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,120
they haven't even start thinking about

317
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,120
more sophisticated stuff like that

318
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,560
they don't need to they don't need to

319
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,360
yeah

320
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,040
it's an roi thing yeah you know the

321
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,880
delay there is between the first breach

322
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,640
and when they actually start to manually

323
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,320
work in the environment that can be

324
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,040
weeks or months so nobody sees anything

325
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,120
right magic how many companies are

326
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,560
currently breached and they are not

327
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,399
being actively worked with because

328
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,000
they're working on some other higher

329
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,600
priority targets

330
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,279
that can be weeks or months imagine how

331
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,640
many they already gain they're

332
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,320
overloaded with networks they already

333
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,160
have access to yeah they own you create

334
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,279
persistence and then they idle they just

335
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,440
unleash time to harvest one one thing

336
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,480
that i i

337
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,240
really liked as well about your your

338
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,240
presentation was that you tied in the

339
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,640
the importance of threat intelligence uh

340
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,920
to to be able to proactively find when

341
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,720
when things are going to hit the fan

342
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,800
uh could you could you elaborate some

343
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,560
more about that because i i mean i i

344
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,880
guess that's that's a case-by-case thing

345
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,000
you you

346
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,120
gave one example uh where you had a

347
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,480
typical mo for a certain threat actor uh

348
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,839
but

349
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,360
how could you use

350
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,200
threat intelligence in a more

351
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,600
general way to to sort of be on top of

352
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,079
things yeah so there are the the more

353
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,320
technical iocs type of things that are

354
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,240
pretty straightforward like oh this ib

355
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,079
address is a c2 server you can

356
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,240
proactively block that right and simple

357
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,160
stuff like that or you know this email

358
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,000
like this domain is sending out machine

359
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,920
emails like you know there is so much of

360
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,480
that and that can be done proactively

361
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,800
if it's shared people can block it um

362
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,600
then the other part is more of uh uh

363
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,360
uh i guess there are different layers

364
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,959
one is the techniques

365
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,399
like the first example we showed about

366
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,600
the rtf uh that you can talk about we

367
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,920
see this attack that works this way and

368
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,160
this is a relatively generic way you can

369
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,760
detect this type of attack even if it's

370
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,760
a variation of it that's tricky to

371
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,360
define because it really depends on case

372
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,200
by case so i don't have a good answer

373
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,959
for that but then the layer on top of

374
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,720
that i think it's more generic in terms

375
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,760
of

376
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,040
what type of attacks are there even like

377
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,040
how common is ransomware and how common

378
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,720
is that they actually delete the backups

379
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,160
before the ransomware if you have those

380
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,320
statistics if you know that in 100 of

381
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,480
the cases they delete the backups that's

382
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,920
probably gonna put that at the top of

383
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,040
the list if you're gonna handle

384
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,639
something start with securing your

385
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,120
backups and testing your backups right

386
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,120
we do this work when we do like threat

387
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,440
intelligence reports and profiles that

388
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,519
are specific to customers we start with

389
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,200
like the generic landscape and then

390
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,560
narrow it down to what they actually

391
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,000
expose and what problems they actually

392
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
have and then we gave recommendations

393
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
that are

394
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
actually mapped to the threats that are

395
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,839
currently seen in the wild because you

396
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,560
know if you need to start from very low

397
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,000
security there is so many things you can

398
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,959
do yeah right where do you start

399
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,720
right you should probably do most of

400
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,320
them anyways but you need to have an

401
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,199
order

402
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,320
we're doing it where do you use the

403
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
priorities start from the ones that are

404
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,560
actively exploiting it in the wild right

405
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,279
now

406
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,800
so we try to do the mapping and give

407
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,680
them a plan that is actually mapped to

408
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,680
urgency based on what's happening but

409
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,839
are you also mapping the

410
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,320
priorities depending on the criticality

411
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,920
of the amount the assets are you

412
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,320
protecting i mean it's it's not just a

413
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,399
generic it environment it could be

414
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,079
production environments it could be like

415
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,560
erp systems etc etc exactly and that

416
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,760
needs to start from the business but

417
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,199
it's a question that of course is

418
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,760
usually asked or is always asked like

419
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,600
what's the worst that can happen

420
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,360
right how would your business die

421
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,600
tomorrow if we don't have for example

422
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,959
the same database or this erp or or uh

423
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,959
for us the uptime is very important for

424
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,199
example and and then you map it to okay

425
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,199
these are important assets what do they

426
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,800
depend on

427
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,480
uh because that's the other challenging

428
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,800
part like they maybe depend on 100

429
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,079
different third-party software that we

430
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,760
have no idea about so what if they get

431
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,720
breached so and do they even know what

432
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,000
they depend on

433
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,160
they usually don't they usually don't

434
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,040
yeah

435
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,720
and it's not easy in their defense it's

436
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,440
hard the systems are complex yeah uh

437
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,880
absolutely looking especially at the

438
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,720
case stuff i mean you're looking at

439
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,800
several layers of dependencies right

440
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,600
yeah yeah but then again

441
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,839
facts in hindsight prove that cassette

442
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,160
was pretty broken and and you know

443
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,800
that's they weren't focusing on that and

444
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,120
people are relying on the trust from

445
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,760
suppliers so it but if you remove that

446
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,000
idea and say okay i got this ip

447
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,240
environment that's mine that i'm the

448
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,040
guard of it's i'm susan whatever and i

449
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,320
have a bunch of things that are exposed

450
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,839
to the internet what i would do

451
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,720
personally is i would i would constantly

452
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,519
just git pull the latest nuclei

453
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,680
templates and whatever and just scan my

454
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,079
environment continuously because that's

455
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,880
where like one day cds come out and see

456
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,519
if it smashes your system if it fits

457
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,600
send yourself a notification in slack

458
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,800
this scp fire falls positive or not like

459
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,120
use the bug mounting methodology and

460
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,360
attack your system externally because if

461
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,959
you don't do it somebody else gonna do

462
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,440
it for you and if it fires at least then

463
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,639
you know and it's 100 better to know

464
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,560
what you're what you're having that's

465
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,880
wonderful than not having it yeah and if

466
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,160
you don't have the capability to do it

467
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,480
yourself i guess that maps to whatever

468
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,519
sort of

469
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,000
vulnerability exposure

470
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,519
type of thing you can put on the outside

471
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,600
right now i i don't even know probably

472
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,040
if there are to be honest i know there

473
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,839
are many uh ideally you have hackers

474
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,560
like stuff that can do that for you

475
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,320
continuously but you know they got that

476
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,040
stuff to do as well

477
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,720
but i mean identifying the exposure is

478
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,120
very important and also be very

479
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,680
uh very quick when things happen because

480
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,519
step number one is inventory know what

481
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,199
you actually have especially what you're

482
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,040
exposed to

483
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,240
step number two is uh be consistent with

484
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,519
the patching level and it's boring to

485
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,920
talk about patching no one likes to like

486
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,880
you know

487
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,480
go through the process of doing the

488
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,240
inventory and check with the perspective

489
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,920
of make sure it's a cash and get the

490
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,440
notification when there is a new patch

491
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,040
available and stuff

492
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,519
but take stats it's

493
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,680
uh it's actually if you look at our own

494
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,959
stats uh from from i think nearly 100

495
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,440
different cases so far this year

496
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,120
[Music]

497
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,199
i think the highest

498
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,040
number on what initial access back to

499
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,599
the use is external exploitation the

500
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,599
next is phishing

501
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,079
and you will see those nice firewalls

502
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,319
with vpns enabled just for the i.t

503
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,240
admins that

504
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,319
they forgot about or that kind of stuff

505
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,000
that's happening all the time because

506
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,119
you do that

507
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,760
the easiest route right yeah but it's on

508
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,480
the internet it's on the internet

509
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,000
yeah and so so no one likes to talk

510
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,359
about patching but it's actually very

511
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,080
important so first reduce the exposure

512
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,600
right if you don't have to have it

513
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,280
exposed don't have it

514
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,520
uh if you need to have it explosive but

515
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,200
not necessarily have to have it hosted

516
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,960
in your own premier infrastructure put

517
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,559
it on a cloud service yeah that's a lot

518
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,799
better if it gets if you get pawned at

519
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,880
least it's not your infrastructure

520
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,039
so

521
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,520
yeah right but still it's a lot better

522
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,120
to have it in your internal network

523
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,520
exactly so i think that's a good note to

524
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,240
uh to end on and um

525
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,160
