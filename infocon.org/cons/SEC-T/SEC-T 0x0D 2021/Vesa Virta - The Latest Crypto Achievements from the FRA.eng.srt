1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,160
[Applause]

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,639
so my name is vesavita i

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,200
am a museum guide at the fora

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,679
and the fra is of course swedish

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:14,559
national

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,199
national intelligence

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,800
national defense radio establishment

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,240
which is the swedish signals

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,160
intelligence agency

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,400
so i'm here to talk about our latest

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,880
crypto achievements

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,480
that we can talk about

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,640
but uh yesterday i had a discussion with

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,960
a colleague and we realized that it's

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,600
actually not the latest it's the latest

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,600
but one because we broke

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,040
something else that we could talk about

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,520
but i'll save that for next year

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,000
so i'm here to talk about the geheim

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,879
schreiber of course

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,840
there is a joke saying that during the

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,640
second world war

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,360
norway was invaded by the germans in a

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,839
matter of days

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,079
denmark in hours

26
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,519
and sweden with telephone

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,200
so

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,439
denmark and norway were attacked

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,840
and

30
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,080
occupied sweden wasn't attacked

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,439
but

32
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,439
i mean the swedes had a

33
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,960
quite

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,640
quite extensive

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,119
trade with germany

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,479
and

37
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,960
they made a deal with the germans to so

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,680
allowing the german soldiers to use

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,720
swedish rails railroads

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,439
which was also

41
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,079
expanded to to

42
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,640
transport cargo as well

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,360
but that agreement was made

44
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,040
like three months after the invasion

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,119
about the same time as the invasion was

46
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,720
that the

47
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,280
germans send the demand

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,439
to the ministry of foreign affairs in

49
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,960
sweden

50
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,520
uh which basically said pretty please

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,759
with the cherry on top could we use your

52
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,399
telecommunication cables

53
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,720
uh only but my german isn't that good

54
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,160
so maybe it's

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,760
because it's in german

56
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,000
but the pretty please and sherry part

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,640
wasn't in there

58
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,040
the swedish swedish response well the

59
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,640
ministry of foreign affairs they they

60
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,319
had no clue

61
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,000
so they went to

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,920
the military headquarters and asked the

63
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,280
commander-in-chief

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,400
how should they react to this request or

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,680
demand from the germans

66
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,319
and the commander chief he went to the

67
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,640
commander of the

68
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,440
signals detachment

69
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,760
and according to the legend his response

70
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,800
was

71
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,840
the protest like hell but thank god for

72
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,720
this opportunity

73
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,360
so

74
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,920
the germans were allowed they were given

75
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,840
control over the cables on april 14th

76
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
five days after the invasion

77
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,720
but there were wiretaps installed

78
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,959
and from the start it was ordinary

79
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,720
teleprinters installed so

80
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,400
everything that was sent over those

81
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,560
cables a copy of that

82
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,760
was

83
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,200
sent to the swedish intelligence

84
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,360
when the germans started use the cables

85
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,879
they started with plain text

86
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,120
communication but they talked about

87
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,840
their geheime

88
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,480
schreiber and one day a message like

89
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,879
this came through

90
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,080
saying that uh here mb set

91
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,680
qrv

92
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,959
meaning that this is station nbc

93
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,480
or nbc

94
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,720
qrb is q code

95
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,040
used in radio communication meaning do

96
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,519
you hear me

97
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,400
and the response was kk meaning sure

98
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,599
then this qep code

99
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,239
followed by five numbers

100
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,400
and then um um

101
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,360
which is short for um

102
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,720
which means turn over to the other mode

103
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,519
the response was vb short for

104
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,959
london

105
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,320
and then

106
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,358
came crypto text

107
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,240
the code used

108
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,400
i mean not the crypto but the code was

109
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,160
but all code

110
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,720
they took five bit codes

111
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,240
and five bits

112
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,360
it's enough

113
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,720
to do

114
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,800
every letter in the alphabet

115
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,560
and then you have some

116
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,479
but it's not enough to do every letter

117
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,479
in the alphabet all the numbers and

118
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,000
special characters

119
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,320
so what you did was to have two

120
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,919
different

121
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,199
modes

122
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,720
so you could have a

123
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,520
letter mode or a figure mode

124
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,600
and you could shift from letter mode to

125
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,000
fiji mode when you use the

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,240
numbers and back to letter mode when

127
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,840
you're going to use letters again

128
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,160
when they started to send crypto text

129
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,880
the swedish intelligence had to change

130
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,720
the interception device

131
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,680
to

132
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,759
produce all the characters and not put

133
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,680
in the blanks where there was a blank

134
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,080
and space and so on so

135
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,919
they made a device that stayed in latin

136
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,320
mode all the time and changed the

137
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,880
control characters like character turn

138
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,000
line feed

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
switch to letter mode switch to figure

140
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,039
mode space and null they changed that to

141
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,400
with the digits one two six

142
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,680
and stayed in that mode all the time

143
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,759
so this was what the

144
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,600
message looked like

145
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,919
after the

146
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,680
the new improved

147
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,280
interception machines

148
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,520
so you see the the here

149
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,960
and then the space and the space was

150
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,000
represented as a three and a five it was

151
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,240
actually the five that was the space

152
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,600
but three was changed to letter mode

153
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,319
and the reason they put in a change to

154
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,759
letter mode was because the lines were

155
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,280
a bit noisy

156
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,960
so you could get some static or some

157
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,479
interference so

158
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,720
if you get the transmission error and

159
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,360
turned into figure mode you would get

160
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,479
gibberish

161
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,960
but if you sent

162
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
switch to letter mode and space every

163
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,560
time when you were supposed to send a

164
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,520
space

165
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,440
then the gibberish would only be

166
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,160
for one word

167
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,840
so what did the swedes do when the they

168
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,600
received the the crypto text well

169
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,039
they sent it to arne burling on a berlin

170
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,280
swedish mathematician

171
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,039
he had done his military service in

172
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,840
in the crypto department

173
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,680
and when the world war ii broke out he

174
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,759
contacted the the military headquarters

175
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,120
and said that he could be of some jews

176
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,080
so

177
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,880
he was connected to the crypto

178
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,120
department or sigil department and later

179
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,039
on to the fra fra started as an

180
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,960
independent agency in 1942.

181
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,400
after the war he

182
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,840
went back to

183
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,160
uppsala to be a professor in mathematics

184
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,360
and in

185
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,520
early 50s he moved to the united states

186
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,280
and

187
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,520
was professor at princeton

188
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,039
but he was

189
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,319
working at the fra or a consultant

190
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,319
to the fra during all of world war ii

191
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,199
so the challenge he received was that

192
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,120
he was given a bunch of uh crypto text

193
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,639
no context

194
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,039
he wasn't even told that he was german

195
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,879
he wasn't even told that he was a

196
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,240
teleprinted prophet

197
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,360
but he he checked through that uh the

198
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,039
the telegrams that he received and

199
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,800
realized that there was some

200
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,039
probably some transmission error

201
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,639
in it so he

202
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,680
he went

203
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,759
back to the the main uh office of

204
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,240
of the crypto department and

205
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,520
uh collected a few more samples

206
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,680
from the end of may

207
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,240
went back to to the place where he was

208
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,479
stationed out in leading here

209
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,960
and he worked on those messages for two

210
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,840
weeks

211
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,120
pen and paper

212
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,000
and a brilliant mind

213
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,279
solved all the

214
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,559
the

215
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,360
crypto and also figure out how the

216
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,440
algorithm worked and how the machine was

217
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,760
built

218
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,000
the message he received or the

219
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,240
conclusions that he made i mean he saw

220
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,000
that there were

221
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,880
32 different characters so 2 to the

222
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,480
power 5

223
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,720
maybe a 5-bit code

224
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,080
someone could have told them that

225
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,480
there were possibly some plain text

226
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,399
messages

227
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,640
or at least in the beginning of

228
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,880
the message it was plain text when they

229
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,279
sent the message key

230
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,560
before the um for um shelton

231
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,279
but

232
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,200
probably he had some

233
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,480
pure

234
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,560
plain text messages as well

235
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,800
so he could see

236
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,760
what

237
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,000
would probably be in the crypto text

238
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,720
for instance the qrv saying do you hear

239
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,600
me

240
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,560
that might have been something that the

241
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,600
operator sent right after the switch to

242
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,320
crypto text

243
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,640
and there were re-transmission and key

244
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,880
reuse

245
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,040
so

246
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,920
the the operators sent different

247
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,160
messages with the same key

248
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,720
so i'm convinced that there are a few

249
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,640
people in here who could

250
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,800
actually do the same thing as he did

251
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,839
back then

252
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,399
but he did it back then

253
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,680
and uh it's a remarkable accomplishment

254
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,839
uh

255
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,320
david khan writes in his book uh kobrex

256
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,480
is that this is probably the greatest

257
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,480
crypto achievement of world war ii

258
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,120
and this is how we did it

259
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,200
pen and paper wrote down the

260
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,519
apparel messages

261
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,200
found out where

262
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,040
where you could guess that there was a

263
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,000
space

264
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,680
and the thing is that the space was a

265
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,839
two it was a bigram so it was two

266
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,200
characters

267
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,839
and when those were offset he could

268
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,519
kind of work on and

269
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,519
find more and more of the of the

270
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,839
information

271
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,040
so the machine that germans used

272
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,120
was a siemens t-52

273
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,839
this was a machine used for strategic

274
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,760
communication uh it weighed

275
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,240
about a hundred kilos

276
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,360
and

277
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,040
it was used from

278
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,399
like the

279
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,079
embassy in

280
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,920
german embassy in stockholm eventually

281
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,279
had one

282
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,040
and uh

283
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,959
communication back to berlin and also

284
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,959
the german troops

285
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,680
from their headquarter in oslo back to

286
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,640
stock to berlin

287
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,519
so

288
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,399
this wasn't like the enigma where more

289
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,160
or less every soldier had one no not

290
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,360
really

291
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,120
you get the idea

292
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,680
the enigma was for tactical operations

293
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,160
technical information and this was more

294
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,800
strategic

295
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,279
so berlin's bearing when he thought

296
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,640
about this

297
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,360
he realized that it was a five-bit code

298
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,680
and how should you how could you

299
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,480
manipulate bits i mean

300
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,600
in this room and abraham earlier talked

301
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,560
that talked about xor being a good way

302
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,839
to manipulate bits well yeah

303
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,839
there was a mech soaring but it wasn't

304
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,839
enough

305
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,320
they also

306
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,320
did swapped the bits

307
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,279
so

308
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,360
after the xoring

309
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,560
the

310
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,480
order of the bits were changed

311
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,800
and uh burling believed that that could

312
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,560
be done with some kind of relays that

313
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,279
either were open or closed and

314
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,480
swapped or

315
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,320
didn't swap

316
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,440
so

317
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,399
here is a picture where where

318
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,880
two of the relays were

319
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,720
open and the three were closed

320
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,440
so

321
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,880
when he did his

322
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,680
uh

323
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,839
put up his parallel

324
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,760
messenger crypto text

325
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,639
and

326
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,240
tried to figure out where where they

327
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,160
could be

328
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,000
something that that he could work with

329
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,480
like the three five and the qrv

330
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,320
and worked on

331
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,399
uh making the

332
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,880
the plain text message longer and longer

333
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,160
he

334
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,760
got to to

335
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,839
this kind of conclusion

336
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,440
where in the the

337
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,240
above part you see the

338
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,360
xor

339
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,160
thing and then the swapping of the the

340
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,760
bits

341
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,160
and when he had done

342
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,880
like hundreds or

343
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,639
characters or something

344
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,720
he saw a pattern

345
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,959
not the pattern with with what was

346
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,839
what it was xor with but the pattern for

347
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:44,720
each

348
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,360
different pic if separate bit so the

349
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,480
first bit

350
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,800
you had a repetition after a while

351
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,440
second bit also repetition but another

352
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,720
period

353
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,120
and third bit also repetition but with

354
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,760
another period

355
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,720
so he figured out that it was some kind

356
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,320
of wheels

357
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,360
or some kind of tape

358
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,959
with different

359
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,160
length

360
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,000
that controlled

361
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,199
each of the bits and each of the relays

362
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,079
switching the the bits

363
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,839
and uh

364
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,440
he realized that

365
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,000
you could build a machine to produce

366
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,519
this kind of crypto text using

367
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,279
10 wheels with pins on it for

368
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,600
pin four one and no pin four

369
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,360
four zero

370
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,880
and the length

371
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,920
or the number of potential pins on each

372
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,160
wheel were different and they were

373
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,600
co-prime so

374
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,240
you wouldn't have a repetition

375
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,839
until

376
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,839
893

377
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,760
quintillions six

378
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,240
yeah you get the point

379
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,560
compared to the enigma where you had the

380
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,639
three

381
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,079
26

382
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,519
letter wheels

383
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,680
which would get a repetition after just

384
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,720
17

385
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,760
000 or something like that

386
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,480
so here here is a picture of

387
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,360
how the machine worked you had 10

388
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,160
different wheels

389
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,399
you got

390
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,839
some

391
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,519
key material

392
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,959
by checking

393
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,360
if there was a pin or not in

394
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,959
a specific position and for every new

395
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,079
letter

396
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,800
encrypted you rotated

397
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,319
the wheels one notch

398
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,959
and it wasn't enough just to have the

399
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,800
wheels you also could change the

400
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,240
ordering of the wheels

401
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,880
and that was done like

402
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,199
every three to nine days they changed

403
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,160
the ordering as well

404
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,160
by the

405
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,040
the small letter d you have

406
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,959
the plain text coming in

407
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,199
the letter r 0 1 0 1 zero

408
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,279
it got xored with the five first bits

409
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,399
leaving zero zero zero one one and then

410
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,040
it went into to the the part where you

411
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,480
could change the

412
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,320
the ordering so what came out was a

413
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,800
one one zero zero zero the letter a

414
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,320
the key management for for the

415
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,040
german operators they they had a

416
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,160
message key which they call the qep that

417
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,320
was the the one you saw in the the first

418
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,399
telegram or first message

419
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,839
qep and then they said the five five

420
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,040
the position of five of the wheels

421
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,160
and then they had a like a code book

422
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,680
where they had

423
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,320
the daily key which was the other five

424
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,399
wheels and they for every day they

425
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,120
changed which of the wheels was in the

426
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,919
the daily key and which was in the

427
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,640
message key

428
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,199
so every day

429
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,640
the

430
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,280
cryptologists at the fra

431
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
three cryptologists work for about one

432
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,799
hour to to find out the daily key

433
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,199
and then they could could

434
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,280
have production on the rest of the

435
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,280
messages

436
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,520
the germans improved the instructions

437
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,440
for the operators

438
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,039
saying that

439
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,080
they should choose a random word

440
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,840
that they call the valve

441
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,240
wart so each message message should

442
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,799
start with a random word for instance

443
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,720
sunshine

444
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,120
many many messages started with sun and

445
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,360
shine

446
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,480
many some messages were where the

447
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,559
operator got a bit creative they used

448
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,760
moonshine instead

449
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,360
and then one

450
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,480
one operator got really cr uh crazy and

451
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,840
went for dono dump ship fart

452
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,280
capitan

453
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,160
that's kind of a random word

454
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,760
but imagine that you're a

455
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,360
cryptanalysis that efra in

456
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,320
in the spring of 1943 and you have you

457
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,080
have seen all these and

458
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,760
and you are working with

459
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,000
trying to figure out the daily key for

460
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,080
today and

461
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,000
the first few letters is dorno

462
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,480
you call that the jackpot

463
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,200
because probably you're going to have

464
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,880
a quite a long crib

465
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,080
the swedish swedes hadn't seen

466
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,400
against the heimdriber they had all only

467
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,360
worked out how it was supposed to work

468
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,799
and uh and berlin told an engineer from

469
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,320
lm ericsson

470
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,000
how to

471
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,320
construct a machine or how a machine

472
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,679
should work

473
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,960
that

474
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,120
could decrypt the messages

475
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,240
so he built what was called apps

476
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,640
back in the day

477
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,720
and those apps

478
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,720
didn't look very much like the geheime

479
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,320
schreiber but they performed the same

480
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,080
same function

481
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,720
so with these you could

482
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,640
you plugged in

483
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,600
the key

484
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,880
and then

485
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,080
you could produce clear text

486
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,290
so production on these ones

487
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,400
[Music]

488
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,840
were from 1940 to or

489
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,520
half of 1940 to the end of 1943.

490
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,480
at the peak there were 32 apps

491
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,520
running

492
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,880
doing the the decryption of the machines

493
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,760
or the messages

494
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,360
half of the staff of fra work with this

495
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,520
so 185 people back then

496
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,520
and they

497
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,880
produced like

498
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,600
300 300 000

499
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,158
telegrams

500
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,480
and

501
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,400
in contrast

502
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,200
to how we do today

503
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,280
the messages were sent

504
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,400
to our customers to the military to

505
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,640
government in

506
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,240
the original original format

507
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,280
and

508
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,440
in the 40s in sweden at least you could

509
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,360
assume that someone working in the

510
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,280
government they spoke german

511
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,039
so they got german messages

512
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,559
today

513
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,960
any intelligence organizations would try

514
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,600
to hide where the information comes from

515
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,919
that they use in the

516
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,720
in the reporting

517
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,480
so some of the results

518
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,360
uh

519
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,520
from

520
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,640
these operations were like

521
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,000
they had good

522
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,960
uh

523
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,000
insight into german troop movements in

524
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,520
norway

525
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,840
so every

526
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,679
time german troops came close to the

527
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,919
swedish border

528
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,480
there was some kind of military exercise

529
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,720
on the swedish side of the border or at

530
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,200
least show of force

531
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,510
so

532
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,039
[Music]

533
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,799
uh the germans realized that sweden

534
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,280
wouldn't be a lame duck

535
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,640
uh and they also the the german military

536
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,880
in norway had also commented on this

537
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,760
that

538
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,640
the swedes were very vigilant and on

539
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,039
their toes

540
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,679
the swedes had information about the

541
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,320
german invasion of soviet union

542
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,679
they knew it more than two weeks in

543
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,000
advance and they even knew the day which

544
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,799
the invasion should start on

545
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,170
that information was passed on to

546
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,080
[Music]

547
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,400
the the british ambassador in moscow he

548
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,200
was

549
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,840
going back to uk and came through

550
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,960
stockholm

551
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,280
so he was told that

552
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,159
the germans were about to invade soviet

553
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,520
union

554
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,880
he passed this information on to to his

555
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,840
soviet colleagues

556
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,360
but since

557
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,200
stalin didn't know where the information

558
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,480
came from he didn't believe it

559
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,280
there were also

560
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,280
my my favorite

561
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,280
telegram was about trade negotiations

562
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,000
because sweden had quite quite a large

563
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,960
trade

564
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,120
with germany

565
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,159
so

566
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,760
the germans sent a group to stockholm in

567
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,440
december

568
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,600
1941 to discuss trade agreements for

569
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,919
1942

570
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,400
and when they were in stockholm

571
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,320
they received

572
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,880
instructions

573
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,039
and the swedes of course receive the

574
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,039
same instructions and

575
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,919
they are basically saying that

576
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,400
we we can accept

577
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,360
interest rate of 3.5

578
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,720
but if the swedes really insist on four

579
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,200
percent well go for it anyway

580
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,480
uh what do you think the the

581
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,679
the interest rate uh was agreed which in

582
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,360
interest rate was agreed on well

583
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,760
this is actually a telegram where you

584
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,799
could

585
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,880
calculate the value

586
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,720
i mean what's the value of not getting

587
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,159
invaded it's

588
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,440
hard to say what's the value knowing how

589
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,679
how many german airplanes there were in

590
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,640
finland and norway

591
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,880
it's good to know but what's the real

592
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,400
monetary value

593
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,880
that's hard to tell but this one

594
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,640
the foreign minister could calculate

595
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,600
that

596
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,039
it was

597
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,400
worth about 20 million crowns

598
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,000
and

599
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,799
20 million crowns back in that day

600
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,080
would have provided for the annual

601
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,760
budget for fra for more than 11 years

602
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,520
my cryptologist colleagues they tend to

603
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,200
change the subject every time i ask them

604
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,400
how many annual budgets they have saved

605
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,279
in the recent week

606
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,159
so this this is uh the the final picture

607
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,679
of of the

608
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,840
gerheim schreiber you see the wheels

609
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,279
up on the top

610
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,559
and behind the locked little compartment

611
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,720
there was the wiring where you could

612
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,440
change the the ordering of the wheels

613
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,520
the

614
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,360
the machine was

615
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,559
constructed in a way that

616
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,960
made it easy for the operators to make

617
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,960
mistakes

618
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,559
when you

619
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,039
set the daily key

620
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,039
you could put in a hatch on each wheel

621
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,200
so you could reset to that position

622
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,120
but the operators tended to put in the

623
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,760
hatch on on all the wheels

624
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,159
so you you because if you get out of

625
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,760
sync

626
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,240
if you get out of sync then you have to

627
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,159
re-sync in some way

628
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,559
and the correct way to do it is to agree

629
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,760
on a position further in the key stream

630
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,880
so if we start somewhere and along the

631
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,799
way we get out of sync you should say

632
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,200
well let's go to the millionth

633
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,760
character in in the text and sync from

634
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,000
there but

635
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,799
it was since it was easy to reset the

636
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,679
wheels for the daily key they used that

637
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,039
for all the

638
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,919
the wheels so that what was

639
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,760
why so many

640
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,000
duplicates

641
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
so many messages were sent with the same

642
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,240
key

643
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,080
and that was about it

644
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,679
do you have any

645
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,880
are there any questions or comments

646
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,300
nope

647
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:33,919
[Applause]

648
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,360
thank you very much visa thank you

649
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,279
like you said it's the latest the latest

650
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,640
thing you can talk about actually uh now

651
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,960
there was something later there was uh

652
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,440
something that called the the lawrence

653
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,480
machine

654
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,520
which the anglo-saxon called tani

655
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,440
which we also broke

656
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,960
we didn't have as much production on

657
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,559
that one but

658
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,159
that was the machine

659
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,559
uh which

660
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,159
made the the brits build the colossus

661
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,320
so we we have a

662
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,720
really cool machine at our museum where

663
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,159
where they have

664
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,279
also built a mock-up of the machine

665
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,760
without knowing how it uh how the

666
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,600
machine actually looked so it's bicycle

667
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,639
chains going

668
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,000
can anybody come to that museum

669
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,919
somebody can come to that museum but but

670
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,919
not just anybody

671
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,880
during the the pandemic we have shut

672
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,399
down every old

673
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,360
existence

674
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,720
so so

675
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,760
we do

676
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,440
production as normal

677
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,399
but we don't do any museum tours all

678
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,760
right but normally how would you

679
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,440
normally i mean

680
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,159
last year at 60

681
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,279
we

682
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,600
invited some from the audience or

683
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,279
actually people from the audience could

684
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,880
enter a raffle and then we

685
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,679
it was like 20 or 30 persons who who

686
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,279
were invited

687
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,440
to our headquarters and

688
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,679
where we had the museum tour well next

689
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,600
year covert is over so yeah do that

690
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,840
again

691
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,880
this year but next year absolutely it's

692
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,279
a lot of people that want to see it yeah

693
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,320
i mean it's a cool museum no

694
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,480
