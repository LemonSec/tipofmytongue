1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,560
come on

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,240
there we are

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,120
so uh i have the uh the pleasure of

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,320
going through a lot of the

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,160
cryptocurrency blockchain and other

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,039
stuff with about my team does that

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,400
and we run into a lot of things on the

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,279
way

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,600
and some of the things that we do

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,279
i was thinking about

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,039
showing you

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,840
the reason for

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,439
um that we see a lot of problems are

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,360
this there's a lot of money in this

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,399
business

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,480
it's about i don't know how i would say

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,760
this but

18
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,840
136 billion dollars

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,840
in d5

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,200
today which is quite

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,719
quite a lot of money so there's a lot of

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,399
people trying to get hold of this

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,199
what we've done in the work is that we

24
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,680
haven't sort of been able to

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,079
do the thing that most psychologists do

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,559
to find out who's the scammers

27
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,000
so

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,159
who you can trust that's up to you as a

29
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,360
user or as a

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,240
customer to these companies

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,280
so

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,640
no

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,320
there we are

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,400
a little bit quick for this

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,360
and

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,240
so

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,320
things that we've found so for example

38
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,799
we have a rounding errors

39
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,200
that unfortunately cancel themselves out

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,200
because of the way that blockchains

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,200
calculate time

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,680
so we had a problem with a interest rate

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,320
that was 20 off

44
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,840
but based on the fact how they

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,520
calculated time it actually was zero

46
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,520
so when the blockchain actually started

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,600
to pick up speed

48
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,479
the

49
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,720
interest rate went off

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,799
and they couldn't figure out why until

51
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,159
we looked at the code and suddenly

52
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,719
realized okay this is why

53
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,040
so now they look at something else to

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,040
have as a time reference instead

55
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,360
this is an interesting one

56
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,080
programs that look and con sort of check

57
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,080
that it's actually itself

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,000
so one equals one

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,879
okay

60
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,680
so let's everybody do whatever they want

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,760
this program that's not too good either

62
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,440
and then we have the the ones that uh

63
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,599
let everybody you sort of change the

64
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,599
parameters on the fly

65
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,200
when it's

66
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,440
saying that well let's change the amount

67
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,160
of money transfer from this account to

68
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,680
another account instead

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,599
we have

70
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,440
impossible endless

71
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,120
trust loops

72
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,360
sort of things that trust something else

73
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,959
that trust something else that trust

74
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,160
something else and that trusts the first

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,519
thing

76
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,200
and that makes

77
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
things really interesting when it comes

78
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,239
to the

79
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,599
how they calculate

80
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,959
uh

81
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,000
the

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,640
outcome of this program another thing is

83
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,319
that a lot of these programs rely on

84
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,400
external

85
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,360
information sources oracles

86
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,680
but the problem is that not all oracles

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,400
are

88
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,519
still valid and in some cases we have

89
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,599
found programs that sort of set up their

90
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,959
own oracles

91
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,050
and the

92
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,120
[Music]

93
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,440
results from those are quite

94
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,920
interesting sometimes when people start

95
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,760
to tune them

96
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,640
to

97
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,440
game the system which is also something

98
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,040
that's interesting so one of the things

99
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,840
that

100
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,840
coming back to the the

101
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,519
the slide about who can you trust

102
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,120
well

103
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,440
you need really need to go through these

104
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,360
sites if they're going to use them and

105
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,879
look at if they are

106
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,360
trans as transparent at you as you

107
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,840
should want them to be

108
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,640
um

109
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,760
when it comes to programming

110
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,519
well a lot of these

111
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,000
programs are being done extremely

112
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,560
quickly or by people that are extremely

113
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,319
cheap or that

114
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,159
are

115
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,159
called them divas sometimes and they

116
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,959
want to show off and the problem is that

117
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,720
they create extremely complex

118
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,079
programming

119
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,810
programming

120
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,519
[Music]

121
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,080
situations for example we had a

122
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,759
situation where we had four different

123
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,240
layers of macros

124
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,160
the code was really really simple but

125
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,400
when you sort of dig into the macros

126
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,680
there was

127
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,000
millions of errors

128
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,720
but it looked good

129
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,320
yeah and then we have the open source

130
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,160
issue well it's

131
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,400
just for it to be open source and not

132
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,479
it's transparent but not secure

133
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,320
i think we all know that

134
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,520
so

135
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,880
we have seen

136
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,280
teams that have been inspired by the

137
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,720
same code base inspired and

138
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,680
sort of

139
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,199
copied the code

140
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,080
and

141
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
when a review suddenly says to one of

142
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,320
the projects that well this is actually

143
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,280
a serious bug in your system

144
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,680
suddenly another project that has been

145
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,000
sort of

146
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,720
using the same code has been

147
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,039
attacked

148
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,840
so it's it's really like being

149
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,560
working in in the wild west

150
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,240
it's uh

151
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,880
fantastic to see all these different

152
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,960
teams sort of competing

153
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,320
against each other

154
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,680
and sometimes not using um shall we say

155
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,320
playing fair

156
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,360
oops

157
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,880
all right stepped on something here

158
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,679
oh well

159
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,280
there we are

160
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,080
uh yeah another thing is error handling

161
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,360
by crashing

162
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,560
uh

163
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,479
people think that there's a really good

164
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,120
idea to just panic the program and let

165
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,800
it crash because the blockchain would

166
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,000
clean it up

167
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,280
it does but it leaves interesting traces

168
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,039
on the environment where the program has

169
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,919
been running like private keys

170
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,319
another interesting things for

171
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,440
forensics to find

172
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,039
and we actually found some interesting

173
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,000
scams where you well the solarwinds

174
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,520
discussions were quite interesting to

175
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,199
listen to because

176
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,039
if you have in this case it was nine

177
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,319
different

178
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,120
sort of things that needed to be

179
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
positive

180
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,440
that would trigger something in in the

181
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,520
program to allow the one who owned the

182
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,080
program to sort of

183
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,280
get rid of

184
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,000
or get all the money in the pool

185
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,599
so it was quite interesting and to

186
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,160
sort of summarize about two billion

187
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,199
dollars has been stolen the last

188
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,319
well

189
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,400
seven years

190
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,479
someone's been returned but most of them

191
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,840
has been sort of missing

192
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,479
and to be honest none of these projects

193
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,360
were actually not thoroughly reviewed

194
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,120
they spot checked stuff in them

195
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,720
and

196
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,800
that may be good but if you're depending

197
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,560
on a lot of different things

198
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,880
if one of those things are broken

199
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,199
the whole thing falls apart

200
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,840
and so we usually say this is a perfect

201
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,240
storm with no reviews

202
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,639
you have ex sort of ridiculous time to

203
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,120
market and there's too much money

204
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,919
pushing for these projects to go online

205
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,240
so a lot of the times when we do as a

206
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,080
step into the review

207
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,800
the program is already online

208
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,479
on the main net

209
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,280
with a huge number of money in it

210
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,039
and they

211
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,960
sort of call us and say well there was

212
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,199
something happening last saturday that

213
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,479
we were sort of

214
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,720
sort of thinking about could you please

215
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,879
have it review our code before we get

216
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,759
sort of completely robbed

217
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,199
and

218
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,039
sometimes we have the time sometimes we

219
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,199
don't

220
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,160
well um i spend more or less my life on

221
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,879
this so if you want to spend some time

222
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,960
with me talking about it because i have

223
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,800
lots more talking about it

224
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,599
we have a little booth around the corner

225
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,560
and

226
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,919
well

227
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,919
thanks

228
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,479
you
