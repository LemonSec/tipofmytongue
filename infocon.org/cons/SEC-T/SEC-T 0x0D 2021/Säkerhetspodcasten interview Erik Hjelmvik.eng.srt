1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,240
yes welcome to this uh small pre

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,400
lightning talk with eric yellow week

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,400
that's uh soon we'll be entering the

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,040
stage here at section 2021 here at the

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,720
zac t

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,720
seconds per constant transmission

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,840
thank you very much

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,279
that's perfect

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,599
so we just heard that you will be up

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,480
talking about something that you spent

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,159
the winter around

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,800
oh yes i spent way too much time reverse

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,440
engineering the uh the back door in the

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,600
solarwinds orion product

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,440
um

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,600
i did it just to

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,920
build a decoder for the

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,360
dns traffic

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,520
but the talk is actually not about my

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,520
decoder it's about a few other things i

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,840
discovered in the in the code oh cool

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,600
that's cool so so really

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,199
trying to trick us into looking and

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,800
watching your talk i guess

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,559
i think i think i will be watching it

26
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,400
anyway anyway yeah it's always

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,400
interesting to hear what you have to say

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,080
uh but but tell us about the um um

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,960
the messages that were sent out using

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,720
dns queries uh what what um

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,200
yeah basically what what uh what

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,840
information uh could you extract from

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,439
that once you once you knew how to

34
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,640
decode it

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,479
there were actually only two pieces of

36
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,119
information that was sent from these

37
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,360
victims or from the initial visions who

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,759
were running secure running the

39
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,479
solar winds or iron platform and the

40
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,360
first thing that they would said was

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,600
their internal active director domain

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,280
name so it would leak the domain name um

43
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,040
sometimes it was too long so you had to

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,920
actually

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,799
split it into two or three dns packets

46
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,520
after that it would send the installed

47
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,520
antivirus or edr

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,360
products

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,680
actually it they only had a list of a

50
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,920
few products and if your product was on

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,439
the list it would sort of set that

52
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,640
and that's all the information the

53
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,119
attackers got so out of that knowing the

54
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,878
active director domain and installed

55
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,840
products they sort of hand-picked

56
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,400
one percent of those to do further

57
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,640
investigation or further uh attacks

58
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,640
exploitation yeah the other ones to just

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,239
disable the back door

60
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,239
which means that for most

61
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,319
victims they just sent like three or

62
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,680
four packets

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,599
over dns over like

64
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,480
uh maybe four days so one packet per day

65
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,440
and i you know who would discover that

66
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,280
that would go totally under the radar

67
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,280
right yeah yeah and that's sort of what

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,360
the talk is about how they managed to

69
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,040
stay under the radar for so long in the

70
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,840
i mean how how what's the the impact

71
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,120
that you've seen that when you're

72
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,599
checking this uh message how i mean in

73
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,280
magnitude

74
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,400
how many infections um

75
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,239
when it was active it's they got like

76
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,640
more than a thousand new victim

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,280
organizations per month

78
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,640
um

79
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,519
i mean i i only see part of the data i

80
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,519
only see what people have gathered in in

81
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,360
passive dns traffic

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,000
i would guess it it's probably much more

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,480
than that but at least a thousand

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,480
victims per month is what they got and

85
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,959
they handpicked you know

86
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,879
probably less than one percent of those

87
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,319
to actually do something about the other

88
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,920
ones that just shut down

89
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
what what

90
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,760
what got you into analyzing this this um

91
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,200
malware then

92
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,680
um first of all when when this was

93
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,440
published by fireeye

94
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,599
i realized that um

95
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,560
this

96
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,400
the the update was actually still

97
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,480
available from solarwinds so i

98
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,480
downloaded it and i discovered hey this

99
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,480
is csharpcode.net

100
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,159
i'm in that developer so i was like yeah

101
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,480
let's have a peek in what is laying that

102
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,920
so i spend some time just looking around

103
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,560
it's like yeah okay i get to general

104
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,640
like what they're trying to do

105
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,799
and then but i was like yeah but someone

106
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,080
will publish a good decoder for this um

107
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,599
then after a while i realized that yeah

108
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,519
people published the coders but fireeye

109
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,599
didn't doesn't do a decoder microsoft

110
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,840
didn't do a decoder you know this was a

111
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,840
guy in china i did a python script that

112
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,759
would do the code this so it's like yeah

113
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,120
but

114
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,440
i am i can understand the pain trying to

115
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,240
direct reverse the reverse encoding of

116
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,400
net functions but do it in python and

117
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,240
make sure that all your output will be

118
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,240
the exact same things that as a net

119
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,960
function for example yes the net coder

120
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,240
is like

121
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,000
this is super simple for me i just do

122
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,840
the exact operations they do but in the

123
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,160
other direction and i'll decode that so

124
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,199
that's why i

125
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,800
felt you know

126
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,479
this is something we need because the

127
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,280
decoding was just it was not decryption

128
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,560
it was just decoding exactly it was like

129
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,360
not base 64 but base 32 with the custom

130
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,919
alphabet just that makes i guess they

131
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,800
use that to make sure that they output

132
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,360
the data they want to send is compatible

133
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,000
with dns so that

134
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,759
they just take the data and format this

135
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,800
into a fake subdomain and

136
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,759
to send it as a dns query so how how did

137
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,080
the because you said that uh you used

138
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,320
your script to

139
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,160
dive into this and and analyze or notify

140
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,080
the search of the different countries

141
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,720
how did they respond

142
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,440
yeah so i provided this script to uh in

143
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,479
some to search organizations

144
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,720
and in some

145
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,479
collaborative

146
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,240
groups where people like work together

147
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,199
to

148
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,800
help uh

149
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,720
make things more secure and i've got

150
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
really good support for that people are

151
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
thanking me for for uh

152
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,000
you know providing them with the table

153
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,680
but you know my tool was only part of

154
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,720
that the a big part was always all these

155
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,560
people who actually collected the dns

156
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,120
data because my tool was useless unless

157
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,080
you had a lot of dns traffic and i was

158
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
super impressed of how many people

159
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,560
actually helped out and like gather

160
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,240
dns traffic go into these specific

161
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,240
domains so that victims could be

162
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,080
identified and could be notified by the

163
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,440
search organizations definitely a

164
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,080
community effort then oh yes

165
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,639
perfect let's not keep you off the stage

166
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,160
because you will be the first lightning

167
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,960
talk here really soon now yeah

168
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,720
a great great having a chat with you and

169
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,520
have uh so uh nice to have a chat with

170
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,440
