5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,720
talks normally in the last two years

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,199
nothing only the stupid video call

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,840
thingy and now i see people so

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,000
i'm happy already i hope you will be as

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,320
well i have way too much slides and the

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,240
schedule is tight so let's just start

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,199
anybody under 15 in the room

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,920
no good because you might get scared of

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,840
some pictures i have

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,800
if i cough by the way i'm a smoker so

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,640
i'm used to coughing so don't don't

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,840
worry i'm fully vaccinated we shouldn't

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,320
talk about the past but still this was

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,760
it right

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,640
the world was closed and i found out

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,559
that the world actually was a cinema

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,399
somewhere in the u.s so basically it's

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,239
okay and i thought the first time i

23
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,399
would speak ever i would look like paul

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,239
on b sides like this

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,800
but i'm here without a mosque so i can

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,199
breathe i'm so happy and i'm in in

27
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,720
sweden where i found out on the plane

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,799
that it is forbidden to be a criminal

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,640
i really love this

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,400
i really love this

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,479
i love this country so much and i'm not

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,080
from here i will tell you where i'm from

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,240
soon but i'm edwin

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,840
i'm 50

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,240
elderly hacker they call me mostly

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,840
pressed a lot of buttons when i was a

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,560
kid played with the old modems i'm sure

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,079
some of you have the same thing here

39
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:32,960
right

40
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,360
downloading like 23 floppies of windows

41
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,920
from a bbs and then at floppy 20 your

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,439
mother picked up the phone everything

43
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,840
was gone that's my age basically

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,600
so if you recognize that you're on with

45
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,880
me i did a lot of stuff on bbs's

46
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,720
and met a lot of hackers and basically

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,399
what i always wanted to do is get those

48
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,560
hackers in the room so like this and

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,200
drive in a car or a washing machine or

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,680
whatever a website and break it

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,880
and that's what we're doing with

52
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,960
zerocopter desk company i work for but

53
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,439
no commercial talk you're lucky i hate

54
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,719
that so don't worry this was it in my

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,560
free time however i'm a member of the

56
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,280
guild of the grumpy old hackers

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,480
you know

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,200
and we try to help kids who who might go

59
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,720
the wrong way because they found a

60
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,280
database with credit card information to

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,440
to get them in the right way again so

62
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,599
prevent them from going to police i'm a

63
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,680
member of the dutch institute of

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,599
vulnerability disclosure

65
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,200
basically we're scanning the whole of

66
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,440
the netherlands every day and look for

67
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,360
vulnerabilities and born companies and i

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,640
will tell you a little bit about it

69
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,800
later also a member of the cavalry does

70
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,440
anybody know recovery

71
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,720
well one okay what we do there is try to

72
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,480
help medical device manufacturers

73
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,319
automotive manufacturers to get their

74
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,120
 in order and those discussions are

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,120
hard we had once a discussion with a car

76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,040
manufacturer we could take over the car

77
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,800
and we said look this is what we can do

78
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,360
fix it and they said nah

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,280
and we said why wouldn't you fix it and

80
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,959
they said well if i have to fix it i

81
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,879
have to get millions of cars back and

82
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,400
that's way too expensive

83
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,840
and then we said yeah but what if we

84
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,800
kill somebody while taking over your car

85
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,319
and they say well we just paid the

86
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,120
deceased family it's way cheaper and

87
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,280
those discussions for us are really

88
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,680
really hard so if you can help in any of

89
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,239
these please come to me after and we

90
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,680
will figure something out in 2013 i

91
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,680
got involved with the dutch government

92
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,640
to help responsible disclosure beefing

93
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,959
or prevent hackers from getting jailed

94
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,120
because they announced that they found

95
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,280
something and wanted to fix it and this

96
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,000
was 2013 so we fought really hard and

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
all government stuff and it's really not

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,480
much fun and then when you get involved

99
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,000
in stuff like this something really

100
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,599
scary happens

101
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,599
you get meals like these

102
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,000
from the state secretary of security and

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,519
justice and i was like oh i'm not going

104
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,360
and then my company was yeah you're

105
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,439
going because this could be cool and

106
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,360
then something really really awesome

107
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,480
happened well awesome terrible i still

108
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,319
have nightmares of this

109
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,439
i had to wear a suit

110
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,760
it's really not me right i hate it do

111
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,200
you know mary mo by the way in the

112
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,400
middle

113
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
if you don't look up some youtube videos

114
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,959
of her she got a pacemaker and it wasn't

115
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,600
programmed correctly so she uh basically

116
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,680
passed out and after that she's hacking

117
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,800
pacemakers also her own pacemaker and

118
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,479
she talks about that and that's really

119
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,960
scary really really scary

120
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,080
we did this and then in 2018 responsible

121
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,639
disclosure got big the u.s took over any

122
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,960
americans in the room

123
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,960
well thank you for that and we call it

124
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,759
now

125
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,400
coordinated vulnerability disclosure

126
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,479
which is a lot tougher but on the other

127
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,560
hand it's more broad and so it's good

128
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,880
and the government still thanked me for

129
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,639
working on this in the netherlands and

130
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,800
they put me in the leaflet of coordinate

131
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,280
vulnerability disclosure like this

132
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,759
this is everywhere around the world

133
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,160
laying on people's desks to discuss

134
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,800
coordinated vulnerabilities um like okay

135
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,199
whatever okay people always ask me well

136
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,199
but what are you most proud of well of

137
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,160
course this one darknet diaries you know

138
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,919
it right the best podcast in the world

139
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,479
about security we were on there in an

140
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,800
episode because we

141
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,280
we hacked trump a little bit just before

142
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,960
his elections so we took over his

143
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,360
twitter account twice

144
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,320
so i'm proud of that and also uh anybody

145
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,400
working with nfc cards and stuff like

146
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,320
that here

147
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,960
cool then you know probably this

148
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,800
and i'm in the source code of lip nfc

149
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,639
basically because i annoyed the hell out

150
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,440
of people while coding but still i made

151
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,039
it in the source code so i'm proud of

152
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:45,919
that

153
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,080
so let's go to work because it was just

154
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,320
the intro of course and i'm here to just

155
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,800
make a little bit of fun and it was a

156
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,960
year right basically a lot of years but

157
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,280
we can't talk about the year before this

158
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,520
year so just this year

159
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,919
and it was drama we had fun of course i

160
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,199
mean you guys know ikea right

161
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,080
so you also know that somebody did this

162
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,160
and that's fun i think

163
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,840
there are still people trapped in some

164
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,600
ikeas

165
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
this is the stuff you have to do also

166
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,160
last year gave finally a solution to the

167
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,840
biggest problem in the world and i'm

168
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,000
really happy about it should you do

169
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,160
pineapple on pizza

170
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,120
right

171
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,160
no

172
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,840
right yes no

173
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,000
no well it's solved because you can do

174
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,080
it this way

175
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,840
this is one of the big things that came

176
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,160
out from the last year and what we all

177
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,560
did last year was this right

178
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,240
zoom meetings

179
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,039
we all wave at each other

180
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,160
why

181
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,240
why do we do that we never wave at each

182
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,639
other and now we're constantly waving at

183
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,039
each other and zoom got of course big

184
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,039
problems because zoom was hacked and

185
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,000
zoom is bad malicious software and

186
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,919
everybody can take it over and nobody is

187
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,919
safe because you use zoom and it's new

188
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,479
and fresh and blah blah blah but we all

189
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,599
here know

190
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,840
that basically of course zoom can do

191
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,240
better and soon maybe we could do better

192
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,319
but it's this scenario that we're

193
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,039
actually fighting every day right

194
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,720
everybody thinks oh you can fight the

195
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,360
bad guys no we can't because we are with

196
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,919
way too many and they are way too much

197
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,520
and they have a lot of money and a lot

198
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,680
of people and a lot of time

199
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,840
and we can't fight that so of course

200
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,720
soon could do better and they did

201
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,360
they did this they did new security

202
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,960
measures and they took on a

203
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,880
vulnerability disclosure policy that

204
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,800
means they actively worked with the

205
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,280
community to get their stuff fixed they

206
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,840
made a safe harbor for hackers which i

207
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,440
really really love and i think every

208
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,440
company should have and i got a lot of

209
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,199
questions of people like oh i'm going to

210
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,280
use this new piece of software is it

211
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,280
secure and the only thing i say is well

212
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,560
look at their pages if they talk cves if

213
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,879
they actively disclose their security

214
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,440
issues then yes they're working at least

215
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,680
with people to fix stuff

216
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,360
and that is something i think you always

217
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
should keep in mind if there's no cves

218
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,400
on their security pages

219
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,879
you know and this stuff this helps and

220
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,479
it works and oh what a year this one we

221
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,960
had a lot of this right last year

222
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,800
and one of the biggest ones of course

223
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
was this one i think you got hit here

224
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,280
with some supermarkets closed down i

225
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,039
read somewhere was that here

226
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,080
yes right well we could have prevented

227
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,319
it because this is vitsa he's a dutch

228
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,000
guy he works for the dutch institute

229
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,320
vulnerability disclosure and he found

230
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,799
four zero days in cassaya software and

231
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,958
he reported them and he was actively

232
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,360
working with cassaya to fix it

233
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,958
and about

234
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,959
a week before it was fixed this happened

235
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,720
and of course there's debates did they

236
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,880
have the bug already did somebody leak

237
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,279
the bug that was found etc etc but it

238
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,720
would almost

239
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,240
never have happened

240
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,000
and the problem for me is if it would

241
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,560
have never happened this would have not

242
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
gone out because nobody talks about

243
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,120
stuff that's going right in security and

244
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,279
i think we should fix that as well it's

245
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,440
always oh we got hacked it's never oh we

246
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,760
got prevented from hacking by some

247
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,640
researcher who gave us good information

248
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,800
i think we should fix that and after

249
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,880
cassaya of course or before cassaya this

250
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,279
one was hit solo wins everybody probably

251
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,640
knows this one

252
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,920
what was the password

253
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,760
nobody

254
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,320
well this could have been prevented very

255
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,120
easily because a researcher shot in a

256
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,120
vulnerability disclosure report two

257
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,200
solar winds a couple of months before

258
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,440
everything got taken over and this was

259
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,800
the report

260
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,560
the password of the update server of

261
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,600
solarwinds was solarwinds123

262
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,399
brilliant that's why hackers could

263
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,880
criminal hackers good get in modify

264
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,800
stuff push it out and everybody had a

265
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
big problem with sono wins and that

266
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,120
password people come on right

267
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,680
those aren't passwords you know

268
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,760
everybody is insecure i know but your

269
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,399
password shouldn't be insecure and i

270
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,560
always do a party trick when i'm on a

271
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,839
party or a holly or um birthday event or

272
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,440
whatever and i say i know your password

273
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,200
and people say no you don't and i say

274
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,120
yeah because it starts with a capital

275
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
letter then there are three or four or

276
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,800
maybe five

277
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,120
lowercase letters then two numbers and

278
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,040
an exclamation mark and then everybody

279
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,279
in the room goes how do you know it well

280
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,959
because eighty percent of the passwords

281
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,360
in the world is built up like this

282
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,519
because we as security people enforce

283
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,760
this your password should contain at

284
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,160
least a capital letter a number and

285
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,000
something else right

286
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,640
fix this as well people please because i

287
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,399
consider it fails

288
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,399
and there's more fails there's so much

289
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,320
fails i could stand here probably for

290
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,399
hours doing fails which i'm not allowed

291
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,120
to

292
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,880
but this one is also something that

293
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,279
always hits me hard

294
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,680
i'm i'm old i did a lot of security

295
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,600
stuff when i was young some illegal but

296
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,720
there was no logging so i'm good

297
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,920
some not illegal but i see the same bugs

298
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,720
coming back over and over and over and

299
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,200
over again so with the stuff i learned

300
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,920
like 30 40 years ago i can still break

301
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,240
 at the moment

302
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
small quiz and i think i get beer

303
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,560
tickets so the first one who knows

304
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,279
without googling what this cve is gets a

305
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,120
beer

306
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,440
anybody

307
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,959
you don't know all your cves by head

308
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,320
this is weird what a weird audience this

309
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,279
is a cve which was posted in the year

310
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,959
you can guess that right

311
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,839
two thousand so

312
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,760
it's long time ago and it was a

313
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,160
directory traversal vulnerability or a

314
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,079
path to reversal vulnerability so with

315
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,160
some slashes behind the url you could

316
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,920
access stuff you weren't allowed to

317
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,360
access

318
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,360
two thousand

319
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,079
then why i might ask in 2019 citrix got

320
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,240
hit with the same vulnerability

321
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,959
the citrix gateway the vpn gateway was

322
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,240
hacked

323
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,800
very easily by just putting stuff behind

324
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,519
it

325
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,000
you know in

326
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,760
2019 and i looked it up this weekend

327
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,600
because i sometimes look it up just for

328
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,120
fun at the moment there are 980 ace

329
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,399
records with the same mistake

330
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,639
even yesterday new ones came

331
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,720
still the same mistake a path traversal

332
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,040
which you could prevent very easily if

333
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,880
you know a little bit about security or

334
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,040
if you think about security but what we

335
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,120
do know at least in the netherlands if

336
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,600
we train students in programming we

337
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,160
never talk about security we just learn

338
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,399
them to program no security intent

339
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,560
whatever and we're always looking for

340
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,800
people who cost nothing but are

341
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,560
brilliant and allowed to work day and

342
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
night i think it's easier to become a

343
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,920
clown at the moment because clowns get

344
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,279
reschooled into c programming for clowns

345
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,519
we should do that for kids as well for

346
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,839
everybody and and i think everybody

347
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,920
should also know how a computer works i

348
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,880
mean

349
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,440
how many of you know what an irq is

350
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
still

351
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,880
good well teach the people next to you

352
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,320
also what it is

353
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,560
because it's the basis of computing if

354
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,120
you know how a computer work works then

355
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,800
if you program or you're looking for

356
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,360
bugs you can deduct way more easily

357
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,040
where the problem might be and you don't

358
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,639
have to know the answer but if you can

359
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,440
narrow it down where it is you can solve

360
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,839
it very very quickly so

361
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,880
we all people basically need to teach

362
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,120
the young to fix stuff like this and

363
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,800
these are all people this is my crew

364
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,760
from gtoa we need people

365
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,399
learned and trained in everything

366
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,760
because when the aliens are coming

367
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,000
who is going to tell them how to exit

368
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,839
vim you know somebody's got to do it

369
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,279
right

370
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,439
it's very important to fix this stuff

371
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,760
this right

372
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
for the elderly amongst us

373
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,839
in the old days everything was a lot

374
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,760
better i see myself in like 10 years

375
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,000
sitting on a bench with a shotgun get

376
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,839
off my lawn you know that would be my

377
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,720
great idea but but it's true

378
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,279
it's actually true i mean in my days you

379
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,920
didn't have takeaway for jet fighters

380
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,199
now they do

381
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,320
why

382
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,720
why do we do stuff like that in my days

383
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,639
when somebody rang the door

384
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,240
it worked

385
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,040
now it doesn't work if google is down

386
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,199
your doorbell is broken why

387
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,279
and who of you wants to have a linkedin

388
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,880
connection with your toothbrush

389
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,320
we don't need like this

390
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,800
it's utterly i mean

391
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,720
my my grandma

392
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,399
she doesn't cope with stuff like this

393
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,560
you know last i was on a walk with my

394
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
grandma and she wanted to feed some

395
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,720
birds so she was walking like this and

396
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,199
she said oh i see birds

397
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,600
you know she doesn't get it

398
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,800
it's way too hard she doesn't get that

399
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,320
people on twitter for two cases of beer

400
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,720
can buy like this

401
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,000
i just traded two cases of beer for this

402
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,839
and everybody's like what

403
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,160
but it's actually true he traded two

404
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
cases of beer for this he even made a

405
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,279
video now on his testing

406
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,920
scary right

407
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,920
i would love to have it by the way but

408
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,800
still scary but he's focused he's

409
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,120
gonna obliterate the sun with it well he

410
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,880
isn't because he's just the echo friend

411
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,880
but twitter is scared now because the

412
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,839
sun will be obliterated he's focused and

413
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,759
focus is a big thing you are all

414
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,079
security people right do you think focus

415
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,560
in cyber security is good or bad

416
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,519
million dollar question

417
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,240
well somebody does this who says bad

418
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,480
focus

419
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,600
what one or two who said good

420
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,639
more

421
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,959
i can argue i think it's bad

422
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,120
you know why i have a simple example we

423
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,880
have a hotel chain in the netherlands

424
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,399
and this hotel chain had something

425
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,800
brilliantly new

426
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,320
if you checked in you didn't get a

427
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,480
access card but you got an email with

428
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,720
codes and you could connect it to their

429
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,399
app and then with their app and

430
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,199
bluetooth or nfc you could open the door

431
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,360
with your mobile phone

432
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,480
and they had programmed this so securely

433
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,680
that they invited hackers and media on

434
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,240
one day to test this so we hackers were

435
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,560
invited we were allowed to try to break

436
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,240
in and then the media would film it and

437
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,399
it would show that it was mega mega

438
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,800
secure and it was perfect they had made

439
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,360
one mistake they invited me

440
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,800
so i came there and there were people

441
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,240
sitting in suits and they were the board

442
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,399
and i said okay i'm here what is the

443
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,240
meaning of this test and they said well

444
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,759
we made a brilliant app and it's super

445
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,240
secure and you can't break in and blah

446
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,800
blah blah i said yeah i understand but

447
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,880
what is the actual meaning of the test

448
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,800
and then it went a bit silent and they

449
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,640
started talking about the app again and

450
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,880
i said for me the test is successful

451
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,439
when i entered the hotel room right they

452
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,119
said yes yes yes if you could do that

453
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,520
the tester succeeded i said good and i

454
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,079
brought a 70 kilo fishing magnet i put

455
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,000
it on the lock i wiggled and the door

456
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,799
opened and i said yes and they said get

457
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,959
out

458
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,359
you aren't supposed to be on tv you

459
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,760
can't be here and i said why

460
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,200
and they said well this is not what we

461
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,520
meant and i said no but you're focusing

462
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,080
you are so much focused on this app that

463
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,160
you forget that we hackers can walk in

464
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,080
with either lockpicks or a magnet or

465
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,720
whatever and we are way too lazy to

466
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,280
disassemble your app for three weeks and

467
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,320
we shouldn't

468
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,240
and then in the end they said okay but

469
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,799
you still can't go on tv so no record of

470
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,080
this but focus is bad we have we do a

471
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,840
lot of bug boundaries with zerocopter we

472
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,679
lastly had a very big

473
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,720
um

474
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,280
bitcoin mining thingy pool and they had

475
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,240
the most secure website ever which is

476
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,919
cool and we put a lot of hackers on it

477
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,080
and we tested it it was pretty secure

478
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,799
but they forgot to open the mysql port

479
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,799
on three something something so

480
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,480
everybody could just walk in through the

481
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,640
back that's what focus does to your

482
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,120
security so please don't focus

483
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,559
and i'm from the netherlands right i

484
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,559
always look at it like this

485
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,320
and you probably always look at it like

486
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,480
this

487
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,480
which is true of course but still

488
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,400
we also have problems and mostly with

489
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,559
this with security experts do you guys

490
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,600
have a lot of security experts on tv or

491
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,280
do you get real people on tv

492
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,799
some people doubt it well in the

493
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,039
netherlands we had a big one some dutch

494
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,960
banks were targeted by heavy dust

495
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,200
attacks so the media said oh please

496
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,440
security speakers come and enlighten the

497
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,840
crowd so i was invited and they had free

498
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,520
beer so

499
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,919
most of the time i'm on tv like this you

500
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,120
know but

501
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,799
while we were sitting there my phone

502
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,039
kept dingling and i was like what's the

503
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,720
matter and it turned out on a different

504
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,559
news station there was a different

505
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,919
expert this lady rihanne von rybrook and

506
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,679
you possibly haven't heard it but if i

507
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,120
say this name in the netherlands

508
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,280
everybody would now leave the room

509
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,720
it's that bad

510
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,640
nobody has ever heard of her but she was

511
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,640
talking for an hour about the cyber

512
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,280
security issues our nation suffers at

513
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,919
the moment and we looked her up like who

514
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,320
is she and she wrote written a book with

515
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,120
a politician alarm bell number one and

516
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,960
then she said she was world's best

517
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,600
hacker with over 30 years experience and

518
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,280
it's a bit weird because the security

519
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,960
community in the netherlands is quite

520
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,840
small

521
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,160
everybody knows each other

522
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,080
never heard of this lady

523
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,480
so we listen to the talk and

524
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,799
if you have a network which is not

525
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,240
connected so you have computers

526
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,080
disconnected from the network to do

527
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,678
important tasks how do you call this

528
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,520
air gapped right

529
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,760
not airbagged right

530
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,440
she does

531
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,840
she was talking about airbags networks

532
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,000
which everybody should have she also

533
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,640
told the media that every hacker

534
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,360
so that includes a lot of you has an app

535
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,120
on their mobile phone and they can just

536
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
walk up to an atm press enter and get

537
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,520
money out of it

538
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,760
i didn't know that

539
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,159
i thought we needed a drill mostly for

540
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,480
this and it's not true anymore because i

541
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,240
saw that io active just did some

542
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,559
research that with nfc specific stuff

543
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,120
they could insert malware on atms read

544
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,880
up if you want but you don't need it i

545
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,880
mean i travel a lot i sometimes take

546
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,919
pictures of atms which are not that hard

547
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,200
to hack

548
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,080
this one was quite easy duct tape

549
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,159
what she talked and talked and talked

550
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,240
all but in the end she came

551
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,559
with a solution and that was the most

552
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,919
interesting part

553
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,960
she suggested that all hacks could be

554
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,320
prevented

555
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,880
if you just join the smart blockchain

556
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,559
what

557
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,559
that was the answer smart blockchain to

558
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,960
everything how do we solve this smart

559
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,880
blockchain

560
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,640
this was our security expert she

561
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,919
reminded me of guy gomer do you know guy

562
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,640
if you don't look this up please guy was

563
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,559
getting a job at the bbc and he was in

564
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,480
the waiting room because he was applying

565
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,640
for a job as a cleaner and then somebody

566
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,960
ran in and said this guy here and i said

567
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,760
yes

568
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,080
and guy was escorted to tv

569
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,840
and he had to talk i think for 10

570
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,919
minutes on apple's mobile phone security

571
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,159
it is brilliant

572
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,240
guys it's yes yes yes you can download

573
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,559
everything yes yes brilliant look it up

574
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,320
it's it's utterly utterly amazing

575
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,480
so yeah we still have time for a couple

576
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,720
of fills right world's best boss in the

577
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,000
u.s

578
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,960
um a company is there which does a lot

579
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,640
with windmills and you probably know

580
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,200
windmills here as well um and they

581
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
thought they were hacked

582
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,880
and that's bad because they have a lot

583
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,720
of stations around the us with a lot of

584
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,640
computers and they said we're hacked so

585
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
they call the security company

586
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,720
a friend of mine and they

587
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,640
came in and he said you think you got

588
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,880
hacked how do you know

589
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,440
and they said well we think we are

590
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,039
hacked because

591
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,280
we have a lot of windows computers in

592
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,120
every stage where there's windmills and

593
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,400
that's a lot

594
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,679
but since yesterday all these computers

595
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,600
are suddenly updated

596
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,360
and we don't update our computers

597
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,880
because we don't have the manpower to

598
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,120
drive there and do an update and etc but

599
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,919
now everything is up to date so we think

600
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,280
we're hacked and we want you to

601
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,520
investigate so they investigated and

602
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,440
they found out indeed they were hacked

603
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,679
and there was a crew on there updating

604
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,840
everything so they didn't get hacked and

605
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,400
mining monero on the computers

606
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
so with that report they came back and

607
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,080
they said well indeed you are hacked and

608
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,760
they're mining monero

609
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,360
is that all they do yes perfect

610
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,799
leave them

611
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,159
leave them there

612
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,919
because we don't have to hire any

613
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,679
security people or any system

614
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,280
administrators or whatever because now

615
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,120
our computers are up to date doesn't

616
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,640
matter if they're mine in the evening

617
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,840
perfect let them drift

618
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,159
this is actually stuff that is happening

619
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,200
around us people in these years and

620
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,600
again oh what a year and how many of you

621
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,720
have animals how many of you have a dog

622
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,400
that he also look like this after the

623
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,600
first weeks of corona

624
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,080
ah so cute right animals look uh

625
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,919
so cute animals

626
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,760
they're monsters

627
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,919
animals are monsters and of course i'm

628
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,840
kidding a bit but still

629
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,360
do you know the biggest problem for

630
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,080
cyber security

631
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,679
animals

632
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,880
it's true

633
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,039
biggest cause of damage to fiber

634
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,320
networks

635
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,120
one squirrels

636
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,679
it's actually an issue and we got video

637
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,320
of there there's a um a site somewhere i

638
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,080
think it's in the uk

639
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,840
but i had to got the video otherwise i

640
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,039
wouldn't be standing here for way too

641
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,039
long and they had a squirrel problem and

642
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,799
what is happening is they have hills and

643
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,000
they have white beam wi-fi systems

644
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,039
sending data around the hills and those

645
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,559
big giant things for wi-fi and one

646
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,039
wasn't working so they went and took a

647
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,840
look

648
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:28,489
[Music]

wild right squirrels killing your

652
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,960
infrastructure completely

653
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,520
what's this

654
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,679

no it's not wiretap

657
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,440
it's amazon alexa

658
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,440

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,360
chances that the tv goes on but whatever

663
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,440
in the us you can use this and say hey

664

delivers milk the next day which is

667
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,679
really cool right but we're forgetting

668
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,640
again animals this boy ordered ten

669
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,039
thousand rolls of toilet paper because

670
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,919
he completely keeps iterating hey alexa

671
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,880
i'm out of toilet paper

672
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,480
and i do this a lot and people say i

673
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,400
don't believe you well

674
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,799
we got video

675
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,840
right okay

676
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,720
animals kill it

677
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,840
okay so we talked a bit about whatever

678
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,080
i'm also supposed to do some cvd and bug

679
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,679
bounty stuff in there so i will help you

680
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,440
does anybody here run responsible

681
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,240
disclosure program cvd programs etc or

682
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,360
good but it's not quite popular

683
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,799
should use more well if you're going to

684
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,279
do it you're going to get shitty replies

685
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,799
a lot of people still think that all

686
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,400
hackers look like this

687
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,799
it's not there's people here in the room

688
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,799
i know who make a lot of money these

689
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,039
guys make like millions i think at the

690
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,279
moment millionaires in bug bounties and

691
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,080
cvd and if you want your kid to become a

692
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,400
hacker i'm very glad to say there's now

693
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,799
books for babies like this one

694
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,520
arrow-based sql injection for babies so

695
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,919
try to teach young

696
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,080
you know very important but we get

697
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,760
reports in here some we do a lot of

698
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,080
report handling for cvd and sometimes

699
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,600
it's so bad

700
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,400
we get uh you have an open port like

701
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,240
3128

702
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,240
so i'm not guessing everybody knows but

703
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,000
some should what is it

704
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,480
well no port knowledge it's squid so

705
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,720
it's your local proxy server on your

706
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,799
local network so people hacking

707
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,520
themselves constantly and sending in

708
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,159
reports it's very funny for us every

709
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,159
time and they all have of course the

710
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,559
correct metasploit pro and burstpro

711
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,880
running this one we get a lot as well

712
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,880
it's very elaborate mill which looks

713
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,240
really cool

714
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,159
and basically says that you have a

715
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,279
problem might be with ssl somewhere etc

716
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,960
please send money

717
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,440
don't you know just look at it

718
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,320
verify it's and then don't pay

719
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,799
those guys it's called dragnet rd and a

720
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,720
lot of people do it in the netherlands

721
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,600
at least

722
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,880
sometimes they get a little more

723
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,559
elaborate this one did a proof of

724
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,279
concept and they said to a client of us

725
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,600
we found your login panel

726
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,320
and if we can guess the correct username

727
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,399
and password we can get in

728
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,440
really

729
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,080
cool they forgot that we even have 2fa

730
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,480
at the client but whatever it was a nice

731
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,600
try

732
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,919
but one of the best we got was this one

733
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,840
i want to warn you you're vulnerable to

734
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,799
cve21612

735
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,279
and we're like oh this sounds legit

736
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,399
right so you look it up and it's a php

737
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,640
mailer remote code execution

738
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,720
while the client was running a ruby on

739
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,720
rails app

740
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,399
so what do you do in case like this well

741
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,120
we just sent this picture back and we

742
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,279
never heard of the researcher again

743
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,679
sometimes however the responses of our

744
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,279
clients are not that good and this is

745
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,760
not our client but xss i hope you all

746
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,840
know what it is

747
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,799
there was a xss report coming in at some

748
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,679
firm and the guy responsible gave the

749
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,840
best reply ever

750
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,720
because

751
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,360
he said you looks like you're trying to

752
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,760
add javascript in a text field and

753
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,279
you're just not supposed to do it

754
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,440
brilliant answer right one of the best

755
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,760
replies ever like this one that's out of

756
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,640
scope

757
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,080
you know our clients also know that's

758
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,760
out of scope yeah attackers will say

759
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,840
that as well that it's out of scope

760
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,919
nobody and this one was i think last

761
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,159
week there was a remote code execution

762
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,320
at samsung and it was reported and it

763
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,559
wasn't at the samsung bugbounty program

764
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,399
where it should go but still

765
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,120
it's a remote code execution don't say

766
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,200
it's out of scope just say thank you and

767
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,279
fix it please that's the most important

768
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,200
thing you can do

769
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,720
so um

770
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,080
i'm not sure how we're running by the

771
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,600
way

772
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,080
i can go oh and i'm already by the

773
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,440
random tricks and tips and fails

774
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,480
good

775
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,279
so a question for you as hackers get

776
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,760
into your hacker self what's the best

777
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,080
way to get passwords from people in the

778
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,559
network

779
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,399
sorry

780
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,440
asked him

781
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,600
yeah brilliant you already screwed up my

782
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,960
joke

783
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,320
anybody else

784
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
you're supposed to say

785
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,720
mimikatz right

786
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,320
that's stuff you know right you put it

787
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,159
in the net and you can get a lot of work

788
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,240
but asking them

789
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,080
is easy and you barely did it but what

790
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,880
we do is we walk into an office and we

791
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,360
just hang up a sheet

792
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,720
the password change sign up sheet

793
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,039
you can fill in your username your

794
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,520
system your old password and your wanted

795
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,880
new password

796
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,159
people fill this in try this it's so

797
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,520
much fun

798
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,360
people actually do this

799
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,039
and then the letter underneath come see

800
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,919
me sean you know that's that's brilliant

801
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,279
the people who fill this in are

802
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,679
basically the same security researchers

803
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,919
who do all the trainings and then put

804
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,399
everything on the internet

805
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,720
you mean why you're a security

806
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,799
professional don't put this out

807
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,039
there there's even numbering on the

808
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,360
cards where we can just identify

809
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,000
ourselves as you and do stuff

810
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,159
which is fun for us but not for you

811
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,559
don't do it and they're just so helpful

812
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,360
in sharing i mean it's like you all left

813
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,679
that colleague right that wants to help

814
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,840
but basically doesn't know how to do it

815
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,640
you're not like this one you know

816
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,640
that's the idea i always get from people

817
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,440
like this very willing to help

818
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,919
always creating problems

819
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,120
another one i always find enjoyable

820
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,039
why can't my kid play with the office

821
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,080
ipad

822
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,840
i'm not sure if you run office ipads

823
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,200
here in sweden but in the netherlands we

824
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,880
have that separated officer ipad's

825
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,720
workout etc

826
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
well why

827
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,480
because it's still not proven that

828
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,519
reincarnation is actually a thing

829
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,600
that's why

830
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,440
this will take a long time to finally

831
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,919
work and then i did something scary i

832
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,279
now put on a swedish sentence

833
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,279
google translate made me do this so i

834
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,840
hope it's correct

835
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,760
does that say something like please

836
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,840
remember

837
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,600
whatever oh yes

838
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,960
cool i can't pronounce it but still okay

839
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,240
so going to my closing please remember

840
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,840
and this is i think the most important

841
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,000
thing the only thing is

842
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,159
unbreakable if it never worked in the

843
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,840
first place

844
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,000
hackers can hack anything if we have

845
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,880
enough time enough money enough skills

846
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,799
and there's a lot of skill in this room

847
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,799
i talk to a lot of speakers

848
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,559
and they are really really awesome and

849
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,159
they will bring you the best content

850
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,480
ever so please do that

851
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,960
if you want to do some hardware hacking

852
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,240
learning etc etc the best thing to go to

853
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,240
and i'm going to try it again in swedish

854
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,399
yopas lopez

855
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,879
lopez

856
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,640
lopez

857
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,279
a thrift store right

858
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,840
this my friend gilles bought yesterday

859
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,559
those are satellite modems

860
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,640
in a thrift store

861
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,039
but buy it you know buy it play with it

862
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,600
desolder it decap it try to hack it do

863
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,919
stuff with it it's very cheap and you

864
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,799
can do anything with it and then one

865
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,519
mostly for organizers and i just checked

866
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,600
they are not sponsoring so i should be

867
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,919
good but if you organize a conference

868
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,559
and you sponsor it as a company

869
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,480
for instance this

870
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,399
beautiful conference and this picture by

871
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,399
the way is made by the beautiful stock

872
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,080
over here thank you it's a brilliant

873
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,120
picture

874
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,799
if you have this conference and you

875
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,799
sponsor it with

876
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,960
beautiful stuff and you put like your

877
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,760
signs near and there's alcohol involved

878
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,799
make sure those signs are actually

879
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,559
secured to the ground

880
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,880
otherwise at the end of the evening they

881
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,600
will look like the toilet

882
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,519
yes

883
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,600

video for everybody who's here and was

898
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,320
like yeah it was fun but it was a little

899
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,000
bit too technical

900
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,800
i found a video

901
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,199
and i'm gonna run when i play it

902
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,000
on how the internet works okay so thank

903
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,199
you very much

904
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,350
have fun goodbye

905
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:26,339
[Applause]

906
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,839
well we didn't get very many questions

907
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,599
from the audience but but there was a

908
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,199
lot of people that wanted to know the

909
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,239
name of this atm hacking app and where

910
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,480
you can download it

911
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,800
yeah i get it i will ask her if i can

912
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,879
find her but we went to her home once

913
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,480
and she didn't open because she wrote a

914
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,239
book and we wanted to get it signed but

915
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,839
she hates us probably for debunking her

916
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,079
so yeah we don't know but i know there's

917
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,000
research i think just from i o active

918
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,520
out where somebody

919
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,480
uh looked a lot at the nfc transactions

920
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,359
on cards for atms and apparently they

921
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,359
did some stuff where they could inject

922
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,320
malware into atms via cards so that's

923
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,440
really awesome research so check it out

924
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,040
no more questions

925
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,280
no that was the only relevant question

926
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,160
good

927
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,880
the other thing was all

928
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,040
thank you for that very much edwin

929
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,800
i think there's no really questions for

930
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,000
that but it was very entertaining

931
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,160
otherwise find me and i'll be here and

932
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,079
now the real technical guys can step up

933
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,520
so good

934
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,890
cheers

935
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:43,140
