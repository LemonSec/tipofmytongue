1
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,160
that looks better

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,240
so i'm going to present how you can 3d

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,800
print your own wi-fi ducky and i will

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
also explain what that is of course

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,160
for those of you who don't know me my

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,160
name is juwan from kuno i'm the r d

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,400
manager and heading up the offensive

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,640
team as well at sparta cyber defense

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,560
first of all to put this in context you

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,040
know these hacks that are

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,520
extraordinary they are so simple so

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,760
beautiful and you almost get frustrated

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,840
why didn't i think of this myself

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,719
they are sort of just takes the whole

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,120
industry forward this is not one of

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,200
those this is a very simple hack that

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,559
you can build yourself it's nothing

18
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,960
fancy at all you most likely have used

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,039
something similar already

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,079
how many of you know what this is

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,600
how many of you have used or owned a

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,000
rubber duck that's quite quite a few

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
most of you actually so for those of you

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,799
who doesn't know what it is it's a usb

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,880
keyboard emulation that sort of injects

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,320
scripts and you can program it to do

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,920
basically whatever you want and it's

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,240
very popular pen testing tool to show

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,640
vulnerability at the different clients

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,240
so for instance you can use it to start

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,119
a calculator beacon out a c2 server

32
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,680
inverse some payload

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,840
that could deliver a reverse shell or

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,439
something like that and you can also

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,840
dump credentials and and um my favorite

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,960
is change to autocorrect settings uh so

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,799
if nobody says you were there try try

38
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,000
writing this and see what happens and

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,799
then they will realize that you

40
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,439
compromise your computer um the wi-fi

41
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,280
duck is like a rubber duck but with

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,119
remote control access and you can build

43
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,280
one yourself if you do it this way i

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,439
think it's super hacky but it's also

45
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,000
rather unstable and and maybe not so

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,479
stealthy so i decided to sort of try to

47
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,479
do this a little bit more efficient

48
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,960
but without using a pcb i actually used

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,280
a 3d printed part here and you can see

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,360
the channels that sort of guides the

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,960
wires that connect the boards together

52
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,240
so there are two different boards one

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,000
for the wi-fi and one for the keyboard

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,919
emulation

55
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,760
and the good thing here is that they

56
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,599
cost less than 100 swedish crowns so you

57
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,280
can just build tons of them and

58
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,760
distribute them plug them in everywhere

59
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,319
so nothing to lose

60
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,760
it doesn't take that long to build but

61
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,040
it's a little bit more than five minutes

62
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,200
so i made a video to show how the build

63
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,920
process is and i it's some fast forward

64
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,319
leaning look first you connect the

65
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,560
devices you compile the code you upload

66
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,480
it

67
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,319
and when that is done you can 3d print

68
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,400
the casing and also the guiding and then

69
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,640
you have copper wire and you just route

70
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,640
that in the sort of channels that are

71
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,120
already prepared and it's like suing

72
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,879
almost i just sort of go around there

73
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,720
and all the endpoints are actually now

74
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,760
sort of short-circuited but i cut them

75
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,160
open and then i can assemble the two

76
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,440
different

77
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,400
boards

78
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,480
so those are then soldered you just add

79
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,360
sort of

80
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,040
power ground and i square c

81
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,280
communication on both boards

82
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,959
and

83
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,200
once that is done you are up and running

84
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,360
and can use it so

85
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,080
you connect it to a host computer

86
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,319
it becomes an access point that you

87
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,599
connect to then that access points uh

88
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,680
set up the web server that you can log

89
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,000
into

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,480
and that web server

91
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,400
contains the script or the payload that

92
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,000
you want to deliver so here i'm

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,599
uploading and sending it to my own web

94
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,400
page

95
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,159
that's it as simple as that so so it's a

96
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,040
quick hack uh very easy to do

97
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,120
and you can find all the files and

98
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,680
unnecessary things here so so um

99
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,080
print it and do something with it and

100
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,560
see what you can do

101
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,640
on my site i also 3d print a lot of

102
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,080
other stuff everything from midi

103
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,560
synthesizers to our dubois clones for

104
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,840
gameboying

105
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,400
um one more thing i think all good

106
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,159
speeches should have some freebies so if

107
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,480
you don't have access to a 3d printer i

108
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,799
have some samples here so let me know

109
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,400
and if you have any questions approach

110
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,400
me or send me an email

111
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,640
thank you
