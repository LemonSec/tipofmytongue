1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,320
so hello and welcome we're back semi

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,719
live from uh secti and uh we have abe

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,639
here for the second time you delivered

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,720
two talks one two one yesterday a

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,199
lightning talk and and uh another one

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,160
today uh felt like it was lightning as

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,199
well

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,840
you you crammed a lot of information in

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,039
in your slot

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,039
uh very interesting you were talking

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,120
about mobile applications and and how to

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,559
exploit them

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,160
yeah what

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,079
what what turned you into looking at

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,719
mobile applications

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,120
well actually at the beginning it was

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,360
more like nobody else knew how to do it

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,079
so i i had a

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,559
first a paint test for a friend like hey

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,160
i have this android application can you

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,640
help me say sure but then it was like my

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,520
first

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,120
mobile dentist so i had like to learn

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,719
from scratch see all the information

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,120
available and learn about this

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,879
and then because i had already done this

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,640
then another friend asked me like hey

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,720
can you give me a hand in this pen test

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,400
about mobile and then i just got into

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,920
all the mobile payments like one after

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,840
another because i was the only one who

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,320
knew how to do it

33
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,159
and everybody else had only knew how to

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,880
do web yeah and then i i could do like

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
web stuff but also like mobile so i was

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,920
like more

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,080
versatile or you know it's always hard

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,200
work

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,479
and then

40
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,960
and then yeah it went from there like

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,520
you know and then i i i could see also

42
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,119
like the evolution you know like at the

43
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,159
beginning

44
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,400
it's a little bit like network security

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,759
right like at the beginning we had

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,600
telnet everything was wide open in the

47
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,280
80s you could like sneeze on a server

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,840
and it will give you a shell you know

49
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,479
and all this and with mobile it was kind

50
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,920
of the same right at the beginning as i

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,280
was saying

52
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,200
the default or any xss or on ios or

53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,119
android you could do like data

54
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,360
exfiltration like read local files send

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,439
them to an attacker and so on and now

56
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,520
this is uh getting tougher yeah like

57
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,159
that the defaults are improving now they

58
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,479
are getting better yeah both android and

59
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,239
ios by default reject clear text http

60
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,319
the developer has to manually add an

61
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,920
exception

62
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,440
and all these things right so this was

63
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,840
all like wide open at the beginning and

64
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,560
then slowly has been like improving the

65
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,520
defaults right how much challenge do you

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,440
find in uh

67
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,360
like

68
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,200
i imagine that there's a lot of

69
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,760
different

70
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,760
[Music]

71
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,200
application environments and that yeah

72
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,560
so so

73
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,599
it's the big challenge or do you do you

74
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,760
manage like

75
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,160
well everything's a little bit similar

76
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,800
or is is there's some

77
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,040
some mobile application framework which

78
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,879
requires a lot more

79
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,920
effort or because i think some of your

80
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,519
demonstrations

81
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,000
like it's a bit like

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,840
controversial and some of them are

83
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,040
secretly action and i mean is there is

84
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,599
some framework which has put

85
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,799
on really unusual challenges for your

86
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,720
not really but what happens with mobile

87
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,959
devices mobile applications a lot of

88
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,360
times is that sometimes just to test the

89
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,879
application first you have like to

90
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,799
bypass root detection or jailbreak

91
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,360
detection and so on and sometimes

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,120
there's applications like from some

93
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,159
banks

94
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,080
that use like some specialized software

95
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,599
for this and they only give you like

96
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,400
this build tool for the test

97
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,200
and that gets time consuming so i would

98
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,920
say that that tends to be a big problem

99
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,280
in mobile because you don't want to

100
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,560
waste too much time bypassing like all

101
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,920
these fluid detection and stuff because

102
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,440
you want to spend the majority of the

103
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,159
time testing actual security yeah i'm

104
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,519
not this

105
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,840
so this can be a problem if you have

106
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,920
relatively little time for the pen test

107
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,319
and and you also have to like to bypass

108
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,799
like all this stuff all these like uh

109
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,879
you know hurdles

110
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,879
then then

111
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,959
it gets tougher but not because the

112
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,280
application is tough but because of the

113
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,080
you know yeah extra work i know one

114
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,959
friend of us he was

115
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,199
supposed to test the mumbai application

116
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,120
but it was the mobile application which

117
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,000
were

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,639
cooperating with uh

119
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,080
let's call it an internet of things

120
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,159
device which came with the application

121
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,840
and

122
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,520
there was so much problems like

123
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,000
just running the the physical

124
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,199
interaction

125
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,880
like

126
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,120
maybe it was faulty hardware or maybe it

127
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,520
was very new software in the application

128
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,479
but

129
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,320
obviously the customer must have thought

130
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,320
that it worked a lot better when they

131
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,880
sent it but

132
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,120
like

133
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,759
testing mobile applications where you

134
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,720
need to

135
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,759
like

136
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,720
get into the specific system and like

137
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,919
get the android etc that's hard

138
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,080
and then add more challenges on top of

139
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,440
that that's

140
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,720
not nice

141
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,320
yeah but if you have a mobile

142
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,880
application connected to some iot device

143
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,120
uh most likely is going to be the iot

144
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,120
device that is the weakest point like in

145
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,520
general mobile devices and mobile

146
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,680
applications then the environment is

147
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,360
much tougher than a desktop computer the

148
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,600
isolation between apps

149
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,440
is is much better

150
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,120
you know like one application cannot

151
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,720
read files from another application by

152
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,720
default this is much more isolated than

153
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,400
in a desktop computer

154
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,720
but iot is like punching a child in the

155
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,000
face it's like

156
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,720
it's like the 80s are back you know

157
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,039
there's like very little but i think it

158
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,280
has to do with the device being cheap

159
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,880
then you cannot pay a lot for the

160
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,440
developers also this is reduced hardware

161
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,800
so you have to write these web

162
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,120
applications in c and stuff and of

163
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,720
course you know what these course i

164
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,560
request for gerry x says they don't know

165
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,560
because they are c developers and yeah

166
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,759
yeah

167
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,080
you have all these so

168
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,000
what what is your opinion

169
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,240
is there any difference between

170
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,400
looking at an ios app or an android app

171
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,280
do you have any preference or is one

172
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,319
proving more challenging

173
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,199
i wouldn't say they are challenging but

174
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,880
typically

175
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,639
in ios the platform is more closed so

176
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,880
there's always

177
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,360
a lot of tools for example stop working

178
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,880
that used to work before that were very

179
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,840
cool and then another aspect is when you

180
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,680
reverse the application so when you are

181
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,520
not given the source code in ios you

182
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,080
just have the binary so it's kind of

183
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,240
messier to do kind of code reviews and

184
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,919
stuff whereas in android depends a

185
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,360
little bit on what framework the

186
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,599
application is written in but in general

187
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,479
if you decompile the apk in many cases

188
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,960
you get the java back or

189
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,800
or like close enough to the source code

190
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,639
to be able to look for

191
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,800
like business logic flaws and other

192
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,599
problems whereas in ios it's more kind

193
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,960
of obscure because you just have the

194
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,800
binary and you know you can still be

195
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,160
compiled but you know it's not as easy

196
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,000
to read it and find vulnerabilities in

197
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,199
that you know

198
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:13,919
i

199
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,919
have one question right and it's

200
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,479
regarding your talk um and and i i

201
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,479
forgot to ask it and

202
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,560
in the audience but

203
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,720
when when you made

204
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,759
um

205
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,759
made the phone

206
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,240
call a phone number you said that it

207
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,199
casted the number as an integer how

208
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,800
would that work with with a zero in in

209
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,000
the beginning

210
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,720
would that still work or would it

211
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,919
huh

212
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,400
i think it's i think it probably would

213
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,720
uh i'm not entirely

214
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,680
entirely sure about the casting but

215
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,280
but probably i think probably it would

216
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,039
be fine it's just uh

217
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,319
did this

218
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,479
this was actually just a dummy

219
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,400
application so it was not a real one

220
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
it's just checking if it's a number yeah

221
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,280
so

222
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,440
uh yeah it was just checking okay if

223
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,919
it's a number i'm going to call it

224
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,400
yeah yeah yeah it was that was not like

225
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,800
the actual flaw that was just a check

226
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,720
you know before making the call cool so

227
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,960
all right well i thought it was an

228
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,720
interesting talk and and you said this

229
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,680
was actually a four-hour workshop yes

230
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,680
yeah yeah because

231
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,280
the thing is normally we do like a

232
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,120
four-hour workshop and it's like a

233
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,440
slower pace and we can like you know be

234
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,120
a little bit more relaxed and doing the

235
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,440
demo and explaining things and so on

236
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,958
but this is why i mentioned it at the

237
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,719
beginning and at the end like if anybody

238
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,799
wants to go like cybersecurity.com slash

239
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,799
free it's all like

240
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,959
this workshop as well as the longer

241
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,279
workshop version of the license of

242
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,360
yesterday and then there's also like a

243
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,200
web workshop so there's ever this like

244
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,600
desktop for electron applications

245
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,120
there's the mobile

246
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,560
mobile actuator mobile there's two

247
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,640
workshops one is just the deep links uh

248
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,760
nexus s

249
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,440
and the other is the practical mobile

250
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,120
app attacks by example this is like the

251
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,640
four hour one

252
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,040
and then there's the electron

253
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,680
so electron web applications and mobile

254
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,240
so cool so how do you think about what

255
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,959
you provide for free versus so because

256
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,200
one option is of course to provide

257
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,510
things commercially and

258
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,200
[Music]

259
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,000
and not release it uh also to speak so

260
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,399
what's with the thought process between

261
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,560
what you make free is uh

262
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,959
trying to follow the marketing principle

263
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,600
of uh

264
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,240
what's the name of this uh try before

265
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,399
you buy right so yeah yeah we're giving

266
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,959
a taste for free and then if somebody

267
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,640
wants to buy one of our courses then

268
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,760
they can

269
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,040
yeah if not that's also fine you know

270
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,279
but you know but we provide like this

271
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,120
this is like a small sample of what we

272
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,360
do in the training you know and then if

273
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,399
somebody's

274
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,000
it's interesting that that is the hope

275
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,080
right yeah cool

276
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,320
yeah it's really good and i think

277
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,160
it's also good to to provide to the

278
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,480
community because we need to be more

279
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,839
people involved in this sure so yeah

280
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,720
well thank you as you said

281
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,640
there's a need for people who can test

282
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,800
the applications that's yeah

283
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,320
thanks a lot for taking the time to talk

284
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,640
to us again abe and

285
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,200
now we will uh go out and enjoy the the

286
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,890
lunch
