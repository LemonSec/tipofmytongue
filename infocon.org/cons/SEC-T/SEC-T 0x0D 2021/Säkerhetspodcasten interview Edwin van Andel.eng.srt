uh it was uh the start of session uh

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,480
from sexy this year uh this year and the

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,240
last year right so this is a two-year

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,120
starter so it's a tough crowd but uh

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,200
yeah i think you managed to

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,719
put them off to a good start thank you

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,120
for doing that well i always hope so i

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,200
hope always that my talks are on one

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,520
side a bit funny to get the audience

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,000
interactive and attractive etc but when

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,760
they walk away that they have something

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,399
that they say um i need to fix that

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,399
maybe you know that's basically the idea

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,160
of my talks always

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,399
yeah and i think you have some really

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,199
good stories to to start picking up

25
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,000
these thoughts yeah i mean uh i mean

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,280
given that

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,320
the bugs that comes over and over again

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,439
that you see

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,520
as as i understand you're part of a

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,280
vulnerability disclosure

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,520
uh set up yeah the netherlands right

32
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,159
yeah yeah correct we work uh besides the

33
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,080
government basically not government so

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,680
we are allowed to do a little bit more

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,920
than the government can do and we try to

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,600
keep the netherlands a little bit secure

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,520
so we're scanning and we're trying to

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,600
help kids that might go the wrong

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,600
direction you know we for instance we

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,040
had a kid lastly

41
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,280
he found a database with a lot of credit

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,600
card information and he's talking to it

43
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,600
about his friends but he knows he can't

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,240
do it use it because he will be arrested

45
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,920
and then some criminal comes and offers

46
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,840
him like three or four thousand euro to

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,920
buy the database and before he knows

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,840
he's in the criminal organization and

49
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,320
and we try as basically grumpy old

50
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,320
hackers that all that he does to say

51
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,799
okay don't do that just disclose it to

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,560
the company we will assist you we'll

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,479
make sure you don't get arrested but you

54
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,880
get basically famous for helping the

55
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,439
company get better and and that's yeah

56
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,520
basically the idea we try to roll out in

57
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,119
the netherlands so a little bit picking

58
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,440
picking uh

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,440
youngsters up before the moral

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,360
conference is fully developed yeah yeah

61
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,280
that's correct and we also work with uh

62
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,959
even dutch police they have got a

63
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,879
program called hack right that if

64
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,000
somebody is arrested below 21 for their

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,360
first cyber crime related incident

66
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,319
they're not put into jail but sent to us

67
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,480
and we basically teach them and show

68
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,959
them the ways of responsible disclosure

69
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,519
and we we pick on them a little but we

70
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,400
try to get basically that that angry

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
don't do this try to help the world get

72
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,120
better and and it works so it's very

73
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,360
nice that's a great setup i mean maybe

74
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,879
something that other countries should

75
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,760
pick up too just send them to these guys

76
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,080
and uh help them get on the track like a

77
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,000
correction institute but uh they're

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,680
right but it's also logic i mean if

79
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,959
you're in in the netherlands for

80
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,120
instance if you pick some if you steal

81
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,959
something from a shop

82
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,920
you know then your parents get angry the

83
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,159
maybe the police the street police gets

84
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,720
angry the shop owner gets angry

85
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,720
school gives you a lecture so you have

86
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,800
four or five different people steering

87
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,680
you and if you are in your room and you

88
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,440
don't have parents who watch over you or

89
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,760
whatever then yeah you're free you don't

90
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,319
get corrected and yeah i think that's a

91
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,720
bit needed and parents always ask me

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,640
what can i do my kid is always upstairs

93
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,360
and

94
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,280
should i install all this software to

95
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,879
monitor him and i say well if he's a

96
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,720
good decker it doesn't matter because he

97
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,040
will bypass it the best thing you can do

98
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,000
is teach them ethics so just tell them

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,920
it's okay if you find something it's

100
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,319
okay if you want to hack but if you do

101
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,280
report it to the company be a nice guy

102
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,599
do it ethically and then you're even

103
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,680
famous in the community and you don't

104
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,360
get arrested you don't have to look over

105
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,799
your shoulder that's the only thing you

106
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,200
can i know one of our

107
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,319
podcast colleagues is part of the

108
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,560
they're doing um

109
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,319
a video which will go on swedish

110
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,560
television vision where they

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,280
basically teach a little bit of

112
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,879
hacking and

113
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,920
do demos cool i i vouch for it being

114
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,239
completely perfect and great because it

115
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,920
hasn't been transmitted yet sorry i

116
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,238
haven't seen anything but but uh but i

117
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,160
because one of them

118
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,479
can imagine challenges with

119
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,880
if you want to intercept like yeah

120
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,080
if the if the parents would be one of us

121
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,960
we might know about it security and

122
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,560
anti-security

123
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,000
related moral dilemmas but

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,759
i think if we would pick a generic

125
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,400
parent they might not be

126
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,040
familiar with i.t security crimes and

127
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,639
things like that yeah that's true and

128
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,639
also kids themselves they see it as a

129
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,880
game you know they're playing games and

130
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,400
they can do anything and then there's

131
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,320
the internet which is also on the screen

132
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,320
so you can do anything and that's where

133
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,639
it goes wrong you know and and i would

134
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,520
suggest trying to educate the parents in

135
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,520
and not so much all the technical stuff

136
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,440
but more on the the moral side the

137
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,639
ethical side you know try to do the same

138
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,720
thing as you would in do a normal life

139
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,800
just if you find somebody's keys outside

140
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,960
the door don't steal them but ring the

141
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,840
door and and and give them back you know

142
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,440
and if you do that on the internet in

143
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,520
the same way then it's all fine but you

144
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,360
also need to educate the con the

145
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,160
companies right oh yes because they will

146
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,919
freak out someone's saying telling you

147
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,520
oh you have we have a vulnerability and

148
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,639
okay we'll

149
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,479
pin you down right so the vulnerability

150
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,680
disclosure

151
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,400
set up needs to be taught also

152
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,639
it's a complete process kids at the

153
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,639
companies yeah yeah well that's true we

154
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,240
have a lot of companies that that come

155
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,720
to us and want to join and if we ask

156
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,800
them about what is your current status

157
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,479
in security and they haven't done

158
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,000
anything we don't accept them as a

159
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,560
client because it's unworkable you have

160
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,639
to have processes in place and and what

161
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,720
we do is we filter in between so that

162
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,080
means that you don't get all the

163
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,240
 but only the serious things go

164
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,880
to the company but still you have to

165
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,120
discuss with the researcher who

166
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,319
because they wanted to know they're

167
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,080
proud of what they found so they want

168
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,240
interaction with you and if you can do

169
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,319
that and if you can also fix it within

170
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,120
like say 60 or 90 days according to

171
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,360
standards then it's fine but you have to

172
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
have that process in place if you don't

173
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,280
then yeah you get a lot of

174
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,479
miscommunication

175
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,560
and miscommunication leads to problems

176
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,800
yeah so you could have like a group of

177
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,919
hang-around companies that want to join

178
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,240
the disclosure program but they're not

179
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,840
there yet they're not there yet no and

180
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,600
they have to be educated and taught and

181
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,400
and

182
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,240
often it's also within a company there

183
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,919
are a few people who want to work with

184
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,080
us um and then it goes up the chain you

185
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,639
know it goes to procurement and to legal

186
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,360
and to the board and they say hackers no

187
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,360
way you know yeah but you're hacked

188
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,680
already you know we just the same stuff

189
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,840
as is happening already only now you

190
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,160
know it instead of that it's criminally

191
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,039
used or whatever but still you know that

192
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,960
and i think it's also the term hacker

193
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,199
that's still too negative i mean if you

194
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,560
look at the media

195
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,720
somebody hacked a hacker did this it's

196
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,880
all bad you know and for us hacking is

197
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,440
our pride you know so it's always

198
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,840
difficult if hacker would be positive

199
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,680
then i think the rest of the world will

200
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,720
follow along a bit i hope

201
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,960
so talking about hacking and and hackers

202
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,160
uh your name admin uh

203
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,720
it comes up some persons might have

204
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,919
heard the dartmouth diary podcast where

205
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:28,880
you

206
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,440
disclosed some details about the hacking

207
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,479
of the trump twitter account right well

208
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,400
it wasn't hacking

209
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,039
good guessing yeah good get no yeah no

210
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,360
not good guessing there was we were in a

211
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,960
brook on a conference in 2016. and

212
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,120
the databases leak all the time and

213
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,039
people correct databases and linkedin

214
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,120
was hacked in 2012

215
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,840
and

216
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,440
around that time the database came

217
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,199
publicly available so we looked at it

218
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,720
and we were just

219
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,560
in our hotel room because it came out

220
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,319
that day warning dutch government

221
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,479
officials like your password is in here

222
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,280
and etc etc so please fix it

223
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,520
and then trump was on tv and then one of

224
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,360
my colleagues said oh i wonder if he

225
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,039
would be in there and we looked and he

226
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,039
was in there with a password which was

227
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,599
like okay it's your tv show it was your

228
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,479
fire yeah you know so and and i had a

229
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,520
little bit

230
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,840
too much beer so i was at my laptop and

231
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,520
somebody said i wonder if it would work

232
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,440
on twitter and i just

233
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,319
entered him you were the one with that

234
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,559
right and i pressed enter and that was

235
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,039
we weren't in yet but we yeah the the

236
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,120
password was correct so and then it was

237
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,519
like oh oh you know and it was two weeks

238
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,919
before election so what do we do if we

239
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,320
stop now then yeah it all traces back to

240
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,880
us and what if somebody else already

241
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,800
knows this and now blames us for

242
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,200
everything that might happen so we went

243
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,279
on tried to get in fully

244
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,600
took screenshots made timelines and then

245
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,560
did responsible disclosure to the trump

246
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,399
administration and the american

247
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,680
government etc and nobody responded so

248
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,519
then we tried to dutch government they

249
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,680
have liaisons in the u.s so they picked

250
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,080
it up and in the end we got like two

251
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,720
weeks later like it's fixed and that was

252
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,279
it but we were scared to go to the us

253
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,600
after that because trump isn't the most

254
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,959
friendly guy

255
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,480
you could easily become one of the

256
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,800
persons that get randomly selected yeah

257
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,120
the ram was selected put in an orange

258
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,080
jumpsuit and bye you know so that was

259
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,000
scared but then there was a second time

260
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,040
right yeah yeah and there was a lot of

261
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,200
doubt in the community whether it was

262
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,440
really a like fake news or if it was

263
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,720
actually

264
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,640
a correct

265
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,120
entry i know it was correct because we

266
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,839
did it but it it's also stupid that it

267
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,279
happened the second time

268
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,560
but um for us the bigger problems were

269
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,000
first of all you should have had

270
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,160
two-factor authentication which was off

271
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,120
again

272
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,279
probably because of the campaign team

273
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,440
also using the same account yeah so

274
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,920
that's why we put one password on it and

275
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,279
leave it that way

276
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,120
but the biggest thing was that twitter

277
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,040
said that they couldn't find anything in

278
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,040
their logging and that was something

279
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,360
that the community said oh but then it's

280
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,320
fake

281
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,920
but we

282
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,959
well not hurt officially but

283
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,760
the idea now is let's put it that way

284
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,399
that twitter wasn't allowed to took

285
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,240
logging on that account because of you

286
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,720
can see the location of the person and

287
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,959
you can see all the other things so

288
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,760
twitter said couldn't log it so that's

289
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,440
why they didn't see it but the the

290
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,680
second time was it basically the same

291
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,440
thing or was it something different it

292
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,720
was the password it was different yeah

293
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,800
the public exclamation mark right yeah

294
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,880
well now it was a different password it

295
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,680
was

296
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,279
make america great again something

297
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,519
something exclamation mark and it was

298
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,680
the same password which was used for the

299
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,560
wi-fi open wi-fi in the rallies

300
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,600
so

301
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,680
it was yeah it was way too easy again

302
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,839
but wasn't this also that you entered

303
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,920
like the you you were logging in from a

304
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,600
different type your address yeah so you

305
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,920
had to we had to agree yeah we had to

306
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,160
take a proxy in the us close to where it

307
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,800
was that was one and the email address

308
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,320
validation had also we also have to do

309
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,560
and it wasn't trump but it was twitter

310
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,519
at trumpet.com so it was very easy and

311
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,360
but the problem was if we wouldn't have

312
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,519
done it and somebody else misused it

313
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,160
published all our dm's or whatever then

314
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,320
it might lead back to us so that's why

315
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,440
we yeah

316
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,920
we had to go let's show okay we can

317
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,240
really get in we can really do anything

318
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,560
here's all our proof all our screenshots

319
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,240
these were the times that we did at this

320
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,160
what's the ip address

321
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,720
please fix this blah blah blah but this

322
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,800
is kind of classic example of where

323
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,760
it's not black and white like you

324
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,000
you can't say this is

325
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,200
100 fine no issue at all and you can't

326
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,639
say

327
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,320
uh

328
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,480
this is really really bad this would be

329
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,399
obviously criminal

330
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,279
because

331
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,200
when we go back to ethics discussion

332
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,639
which we had before

333
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,680
like

334
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,160
often things are

335
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,519
great yeah they're they're great if if

336
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,720
if nothing you are doing

337
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,639
makes you ask

338
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,200
any ethical questions

339
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,480
maybe either you're not doing anything

340
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,720
interesting or you have a very weird

341
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,600
sense of morals or effort yes it's true

342
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,760
but it's also true for our researchers

343
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,279
because a lot of times clients have

344
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,760
indeed scopes but then sometimes you

345
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,680
think well i think there's a problem

346
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,480
here

347
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,959
but i have to go basically too far

348
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,040
but then i can show it to you yeah you

349
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,720
know what do you want and and with our

350
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,200
clients we can ask but in

351
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,720
responsible disclosure or whatever you

352
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,120
basically can't ask so then it's up to

353
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,200
you are you gonna do it and then in the

354
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,000
netherlands we have a law uh and all the

355
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,399
judges have it and it's basically said

356
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,480
that if you break into a system and you

357
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,959
can download all client data

358
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,519
don't do it just download two records to

359
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,760
show that you can so you are allowed to

360
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,920
break in and you are allowed to download

361
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,560
but only two records to show that you

362
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,120
can and then you won't get arrested all

363
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,880
the judges have to have that thing and

364
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
that's really awesome is it

365
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,560
like is it um

366
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,480
so you say it's the law like is it

367
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,880
written in a law or is it's a clarified

368
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,240
practice from historical there is a law

369
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,079
which says that responsible disclosure

370
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,000
is allowed in the netherlands

371
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and all the judges have the rulings

372
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,240
about it near their desk yeah so that

373
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,000
basically means that if you do something

374
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,519
in the netherlands as hacker and the

375
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,440
company wants to sue you

376
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,519
and then the judges looks at it and say

377
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,079
if you applied to now you didn't publish

378
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,399
it you didn't download too much you kept

379
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,160
to all the rules you announced it you

380
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,079
did blah blah we're not going to

381
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,360
prosecute

382
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
and that's awesome because it pushes

383
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,160
companies to to employ men's responsible

384
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
disclosure but going into that if you

385
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,079
look at the case situation that you also

386
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,440
covered in your talk

387
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,160
uh there was findings right

388
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,440
that were

389
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,160
reported that was actually

390
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,120
being used in the attack correct yeah

391
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,920
so

392
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,360
so

393
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,880
was it after the disclosure was out no

394
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,519
so it was before this so there could be

395
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,000
ideas or or conspiracies that that

396
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,560
someone has access to leaked yeah that's

397
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,240
i mean that's always the problem but we

398
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
see that also in our regular background

399
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,160
programs that when something starts that

400
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,519
the hacker finds something and three

401
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,519
minutes later another one finds the same

402
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,680
thing

403
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,639
it's it's not always like

404
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,360
obvious but i think often you can see

405
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,519
like some sort of trends that

406
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,160
if there's some new

407
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,000
kind of

408
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,560
entry point into thinking about security

409
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,519
or one new kind of it doesn't have to be

410
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,839
like a new way of exploiting but just

411
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,160
some new way of getting to a problem

412
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,320
it seems like

413
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,880
once there is some sort of breakthrough

414
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,000
then

415
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,800
you will see independently

416
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,440
very similar findings will grow out at

417
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
different places so

418
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,480
um

419
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,839
but that's the that's the deal right

420
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,680
with the cassette now they they managed

421
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,399
to show that managed software remote

422
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,040
access software is a good way to get in

423
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,800
because you have all the privileges and

424
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,360
there's just open doors

425
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,000
so you just go after those guys and you

426
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,320
will be into everything but that's the

427
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,079
the world i mean in the beginning all

428
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,920
the hackers were focused on windows you

429
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,240
know so because everybody had windows so

430
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,839
it's the most easy access point then

431
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,120
windows 10 got basically more secure so

432
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,959
what we're looking at now what does

433
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,160
everybody have besides windows antivirus

434
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,759
so now all the hackers focus on

435
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,600
antivirus because if you are in

436
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,519
endovirus you can access anything yeah

437
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,440
and that will go on and on and on and

438
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,600
it's the same with this i mean first the

439
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,880
companies were attacked now the

440
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,480
companies get more and more secure so

441
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
now you go for the vendors which are

442
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,399
used in the companies and companies

443
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,399
don't test it i think if you want to do

444
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,800
a true security test of are you

445
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,440
vulnerable for this give somebody a pen

446
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,000
tester access to one computer in your

447
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,360
network fully

448
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,279
because that's what basically happens if

449
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,120
you have like an air conditioning system

450
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,880
and it's remotely managed there's a

451
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,600
computer in your network and if that one

452
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,680
is breached then they can reach anything

453
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,240
yeah and those tests are the next thing

454
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,480
we should do but yeah you're always one

455
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,600
step behind of criminals thinking but

456
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
it's also i mean uh i mean if you lock

457
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,839
down everything to the 100 percent

458
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,680
security

459
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,040
we will go out to visit because we

460
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,360
couldn't work right correct and even

461
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,240
then 100 security can never be no

462
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,480
exactly no i don't think so so so what's

463
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,759
the next step is you're talking about

464
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,680
supply chain as as the thing that's

465
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,199
going on for the last couple of years

466
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,120
right because you trust your vendors you

467
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,480
don't want to check them you know oh

468
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,160
they're trustworthy and then you get in

469
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,759
there yeah but what's the next step

470
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,120
would you say that

471
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,359
i mean what's coming next after supply

472
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,880
chain uh well i i just had a brilliant

473
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,640
talk with a friend of mine about this

474
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,959
and he says the next step is

475
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,640
configuration issues

476
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,760
and i was like

477
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,359
and he said yeah everybody's building

478
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,160
now systems which might be more secure

479
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,240
etc you will still have bugs but it

480
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,720
doesn't matter the problem now is

481
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
configuration issues and there have been

482
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,480
research with some very advanced

483
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,480
companies that did a scan of all their

484
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,120
bugs and about 70 percent of all their

485
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,760
bugs were configuration issues so that

486
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,559
means i have vendor a i offender b and i

487
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,280
offender c and i have to combine them

488
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,280
and if i make one mistake then somebody

489
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,799
can misuse that

490
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,120
and he did some research and he said if

491
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,960
you have an a clear pc so a new computer

492
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,280
and you install windows on it there is

493
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,240
10 to the time 600 possibilities to

494
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,320
configure windows

495
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,960
so there might be one million mistakes

496
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,880
in there you don't know you know and i

497
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,080
think that's

498
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,480
that will be but not now because we're

499
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,039
way too busy with still perimeters with

500
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:09,919
still

501
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,919
uh client-side attacks with still

502
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,160
everything that's there bug bounties etc

503
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,679
but i think in a couple of years you

504
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,760
will see a shift to okay we got the

505
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,720
basis of security fixed what now well

506
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,799
the interaction thing the configuration

507
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,480
stuff all that stuff i think that will

508
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,720
be the biggest thing in

509
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,880
three to five years because i mean a lot

510
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,280
of stuff that you have around you in in

511
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,880
the in our iot world trade is

512
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,559
configuration right it's not a program

513
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,960
anymore it's cooperation on abs account

514
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,120
or yeah some other and if you make a

515
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,280
mistake there then you can be as secure

516
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,360
as you want but you still don't so i

517
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,280
think that will be the biggest thing in

518
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,640
a couple of years so we're looking

519
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,799
forward to the future right a bright or

520
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,480
a scary future oh a fun future

521
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,799
i see some money stuff so i'm not i'm

522
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,679
not even you know everything is the same

523
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,080
now i'm not curious or i'm yeah i'm

524
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,919
still curious how stuff work of course

525
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,320
but i'm not surprised when things are

526
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,280
broken or whatever it's the same thing

527
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,840
over and over again yeah correct okay
