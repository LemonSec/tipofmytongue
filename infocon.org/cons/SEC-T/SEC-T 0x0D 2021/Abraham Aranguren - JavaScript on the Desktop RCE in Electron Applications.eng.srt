1
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,800
can you hear me yeah

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,080
cool so thank you for coming um

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,720
i apologize in advance because the it's

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,119
difficult to explain electron security

5
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,640
in uh only 15 minutes so

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,079
if somebody uh wants like this like a a

7
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,920
long workshop like one hour and a half

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,320
that if you go to 70 security.com slash

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,120
free

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,840
you can uh get it for free there so

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,280
uh i'm abraham gurin and uh

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,920
i don't know that's the uh about me but

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,840
basically i'm the ceo of sony security

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,399
and uh and yeah and i was doing the

15
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,440
training for the mobile course uh

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,079
for section this year so

17
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,559
so i'm going to talk about electron

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,199
security and the

19
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,920
a very specific case with a lack of

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,519
context isolation

21
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,520
where we're going to get remote code

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,479
execution in windows without warnings

23
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,600
attacking preload scripts right so

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,920
for those who might not be familiar

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,720
electron applications are written

26
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,840
in javascript and this is very cool for

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,840
developing purposes because

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,520
you only have to pay javascript

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,280
developers and you get an application

30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,600
working on windows linux and mac

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,920
and you know you don't have to pay like

32
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,880
three

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,720
development departments you only have to

34
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,759
pay one right so that's always useful

35
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,920
now this is part of a workshop that we

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,280
do for free so

37
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,720
if somebody gets the free workshop

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,720
there's the the vulnerable application

39
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,159
that i'm going to demo um today is also

40
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,960
available uh for free so

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,000
uh in electron there's a concept of

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,320
context isolation right so if you get

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,880
xss on alert and on a electron

44
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,079
application

45
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,520
um

46
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,640
then

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,719
let's say you have an exercise right so

48
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,440
you try to do alert window abc right so

49
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,080
if there's no context isolation

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,560
you will be able to read variables

51
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,239
defined on the preload script right so

52
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,480
this would be the case without

53
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,920
context isolation and when there is

54
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,160
context isolation then this is not

55
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,720
possible right so when context isolation

56
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,599
is enabled this is better for security

57
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,519
now since i'm going to try a live demo

58
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,319
i'm going to start booting the vm which

59
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,360
will take a little bit um

60
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,160
so

61
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,879
uh in the demo that i'm going to show

62
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,360
um there's a preload script and it's

63
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,319
using uh the indexof function right so

64
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,959
what we can do uh when there is no

65
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,640
context isolation

66
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,480
is we can redefine this function in

67
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,440
javascript to return something else

68
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,440
right so when there is a javascript

69
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,200
piece of code that is running the index

70
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,560
of function

71
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,159
instead of

72
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,840
running as normally it would in

73
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,120
javascript

74
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,200
it will return whatever we want right so

75
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,800
here we are redefining it to always

76
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,239
return leads

77
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,879
so we can bypass a security check so

78
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,840
this will make more sense in the demo

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,480
when the demo defines safe protocols for

80
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,440
hdp and sdps so this actually correct

81
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,560
these

82
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,280
links that are safe to open in electron

83
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,799
applications

84
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,640
and then we will send a message and this

85
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,200
link will be linkified but when the user

86
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,400
clicks on it

87
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,640
using this

88
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,200
xss we will be able to to attack this

89
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
right so

90
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,920
this is the security check so when you

91
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,599
click on it it says this link is unsafe

92
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,879
but we will

93
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,920
bypass this by redefining the index of

94
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,159
function right so

95
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,400
with this xss we redefine

96
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,080
the index of function

97
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,519
to always return this so this will

98
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,599
bypass the security check

99
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,319
so we will get a code execution without

100
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,360
warnings

101
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,000
in windows right so let me try to do the

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,439
demo let's see if this worked

103
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,239
can you see this

104
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,530
is it readable enough

105
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,358
[Music]

106
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,399
yes

107
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,279
so this is the vulnerable application

108
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,479
i'm going to delete this

109
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,199
and basically

110
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,880
i think it will make more sense if i

111
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,560
show you first

112
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,680
uh

113
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,320
the save protocol so i'm going to

114
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,160
to do the same thing as the application

115
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,199
right so

116
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,440
i go to here to the developer tools

117
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,680
console

118
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,919
so if i paste this

119
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,759
and now um

120
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,919
let me see because i think i have it

121
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,440
here

122
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,800
yes so

123
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,000
[Music]

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,120
so if i do this and now

125
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,520
this uh

126
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,479
mic

127
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,000
i prefer uh

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,720
wireless mics but give me a second

129
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,000
um

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
so whoops

131
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,800
okay

132
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,440
so okay so

133
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,759
if i try to do safe protocols index of

134
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,160
http it says zero if i do htps

135
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,560
it says one right because the array

136
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,199
that is defining the save protocols

137
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,400
starts with zero

138
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,960
and then it's it's number one right

139
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,639
and then if i try to do it with file

140
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,759
then this will show

141
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,160
minus one right so that is what the

142
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,240
logic of the application is right so

143
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,880
it's saying index of file

144
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,479
minus one so

145
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,000
the code

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,039
is here

147
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,840
is saying when the index of returns

148
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,919
different than minus one then

149
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,120
it will do shall open external so if i

150
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,919
send this message

151
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:56,880
saying

152
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,000
hey look at this

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,600
[Music]

154
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,840
with a file url pointing to a

155
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,199
java file

156
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,240
on a network location

157
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,080
right which is insecure to open because

158
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,000
it will give us a remote code execution

159
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,240
without warning on windows we get this

160
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,400
link is unsafe right

161
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,440
so

162
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
the security check is working but if i

163
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,280
send the same message

164
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:21,980
with

165
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,440
[Music]

166
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,160
the xss that is redefining the indexof

167
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,680
function

168
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,750
so if i go here

169
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,280
[Music]

170
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,319
and i paste this right so i'm basically

171
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,720
simulating a chat application where you

172
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,479
send a message to another user right so

173
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,600
we're just sending a message to

174
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,759
ourselves for simplicity

175
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,280
but it's basically just sending a

176
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,039
message the application linkifies the

177
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,880
link and then we have an xss right the

178
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,680
xss is redefining the index of function

179
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,240
so i send the message

180
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,840
now you can see the broken image there's

181
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,120
an xss so if i now click on the link

182
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,240
you can see

183
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,360
the javascript executed so we have code

184
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,560
execution

185
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,240
without warnings on windows which is

186
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,319
true code execution right so the user

187
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,919
didn't have to click

188
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,880
anywhere so that's the end of the

189
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,240
presentation

190
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,919
i'm not sure if we have time for

191
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,479
questions but you can ask me

192
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,560
later or whatever and and you can get

193
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,400
the full workshop for free there if you

194
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,360
want to

195
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,759
so that's it
