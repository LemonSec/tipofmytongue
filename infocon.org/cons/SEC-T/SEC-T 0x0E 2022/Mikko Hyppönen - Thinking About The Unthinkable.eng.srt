1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,199
first things first

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,320
i am

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,440
verified on twitter

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,639
whoa boy

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,079
those of you who follow me on twitter

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,160
might know that for the last 11 years

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,439
i've been fighting with twitter

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,359
organizers to convince them that i

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,080
should get the tag because i've had been

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,240
i've been fighting with various copycats

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,199
on twitter over and over again finally

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,920
yesterday i got it so

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,320
that's all i needed

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,680
now

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,920
many of you remember me

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,440
as someone who used to work for a

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,600
company called data fellows or maybe

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,120
more likely as someone who used to work

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,680
for a company called f-secure but now

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,239
i am working for a company called wit

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,239
secure

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,160
if secure split into two companies first

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,760
day of july

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,480
the consumer side is called f-secure the

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,960
business-to-business side is called wit

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,160
secure

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,559
those are separate companies we are

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,880
still headquartered in helsinki finland

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,439
we are still in the same building

30
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,439
but those buildings that buildings now

31
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,159
split into different floors

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,920
people who work for which secure can't

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,680
get in to have secure floors and the

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,920
other way around which is weird but

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,240
that's the way it is however

36
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,479
there are exceptions

37
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,880
i actually work for both companies

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,840
i spend 90 of my time on which secure

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,400
but then which secure sales 10 of my

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,880
time to f-secure so i can actually enter

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,880
both floors or both areas of the company

42
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,920
which is

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,840
which is

44
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,439
nice so

45
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,200
one of the largest

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,119
data security companies in the nordics

47
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,439
split into two companies we have secured

48
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,960
400 people

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,399
which secure is 1 300 people consumer

50
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,479
side and business side

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,320
but i'm not here

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,719
to talk about that i'm not here to think

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,240
about that i'm here to think about the

54
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,960
unthinkable

55
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,320
so how do we start this

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,239
well

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,760
when the door opened

58
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,920
and the captain

59
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,560
walked in carrying his

60
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,000
rk 62 rifle

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,760
i realized

62
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,879
that we have been caught

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,879
as you know in finland we have a

64
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,800
military draft system

65
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,840
all the males get to go to army they do

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,680
a year of training then after that they

67
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,360
go back regularly for refreshers

68
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,720
and the thing which

69
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,720
is important about our military draft

70
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,760
system is that we try to put experts

71
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,239
in the position in their reserve

72
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,480
unit which would match with their

73
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,519
civilian skills which means

74
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,239
whenever i go back to the army well

75
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,239
first of all they don't make me cut my

76
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,239
hair anymore you only have to do it the

77
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,640
first time around

78
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,000
second of all

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,560
they don't give me a rifle anymore

80
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,800
they give me a keyboard because i'm much

81
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,840
more

82
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,720
how should i say it effective

83
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,440
with a keyboard than with a rifle that's

84
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,000
the logic if someone is an expert in

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,760
telecommunications that's what they do

86
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,080
in the reserves if someone is good with

87
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,319
cyber stuff that's what they do in the

88
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,040
reserve if someone is a civilian doctor

89
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,640
that's what they do in the reserves

90
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,319
so one of the refreshers i did

91
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,799
years ago involved

92
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,120
a rehearsal where we were going around

93
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,319
finland

94
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,400
changing locations

95
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,720
every day or every other day

96
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,680
with a small group of geeks

97
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,840
and we had a mission of launching

98
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,360
attacks

99
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,599
against the military network

100
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,799
and there was another team which spent

101
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,080
that week trying to find us so trying to

102
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,519
physically

103
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,319
find us they were going behind us

104
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,640
trying to use different forensics to

105
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,000
figure out

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,840
what we were doing and where we were

107
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,160
very hands-on

108
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,759
very interesting

109
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,240
very exciting also the kind of thing you

110
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,639
don't get to do in normal civilian

111
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,360
environments and yes

112
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
on day six of the

113
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,600
refresher we were caught when the door

114
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,000
opened and the captain walked in

115
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,720
we knew that okay

116
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,199
we survived for six days but we didn't

117
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,600
survive forever

118
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,240
so finland

119
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,120
has had a very big neighbor

120
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,919
for a very long time

121
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,240
very big and very unpredictable neighbor

122
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,960
both my grandfathers

123
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,880
fought the russians

124
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,040
in the second world war

125
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,919
and we've been thinking about

126
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,960
how to prepare ourselves

127
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,360
for the unthinkable

128
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,039
as long as we've been independent

129
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,479
and today that of course involves

130
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,479
how do you prepare sell yourself and

131
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,360
your society with technology

132
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,080
technology is changing the world

133
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,039
right now during our time

134
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,520
faster than ever before

135
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,199
i think this is pretty obvious i think

136
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,039
it's pretty obvious that there's a

137
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,039
massive revolution going around us

138
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,759
but it's surprisingly hard to see the

139
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,240
size of the revolution you're living in

140
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,720
when you're living inside of it and this

141
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,720
is what's happening to us we have an

142
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,000
idea

143
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,479
that technology

144
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,520
and connectivity are changing the world

145
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,360
but it's kind of hard to see just how

146
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,759
big this change is

147
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,639
and i've been thinking about this a lot

148
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,639
over the last two and a half years

149
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,639
because i spent the pandemic time

150
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,919
writing a book

151
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,960
this one right here came out in english

152
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,280
last month

153
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,680
and in the book

154
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,840
i tried to illustrate how the world

155
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,560
changed and how it changed for the

156
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,600
better

157
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,680
and for the worse

158
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,000
thanks to this connectivity revolution

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,560
the internet is the best thing which has

160
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,520
happened during our time and the worst

161
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,319
thing

162
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,479
which has happened during our time it's

163
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,240
bringing us all these great benefits at

164
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,160
the very same time it's exposing us to

165
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,240
completely new kinds

166
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,919
of risks completely new kinds of crime

167
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,919
crime used to be local today crime is

168
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,319
global

169
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,120
one factoid i have in the book

170
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,199
is that in 1994

171
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,800
in finland

172
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,360
there were 140

173
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,440
bank robberies

174
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,280
140 bank robberies in which

175
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,800
robbers went to a bank with guns to

176
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,960
steal cash

177
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,160
think about that

178
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,880
140 times a year

179
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,120
the last time we had a bank robbery in

180
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,360
finland was 11 years ago

181
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,120
of course they don't happen anymore

182
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,880
neither you don't have bank robberies

183
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,280
either because banks

184
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,199
don't really exist they're only online

185
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,880
the few banks we have in the real world

186
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,960
don't have much cash

187
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,479
bank robbers

188
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,720
have went online

189
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,199
just like all the other criminals

190
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,880
and the real world bank robbers

191
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,599
were living close to the bank they were

192
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,960
robbing

193
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
they were from the same city from the

194
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,120
same town they were from within the 100

195
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,680
kilometer radius from the bank this was

196
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,479
local crime

197
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,000
today

198
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,240
when our online banking systems or

199
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,120
credit card systems are getting hit by

200
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,440
online bank robbers

201
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,120
they are not from the same city or town

202
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,720
or country

203
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,080
at all

204
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,000
they can be from anywhere on the planet

205
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,520
because that's one thing

206
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,440
the internet did it took away geography

207
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,599
internet deleted

208
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,560
geography it deleted distance

209
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,840
and in many ways it also deleted borders

210
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,919
and this is not the first time

211
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,320
a massive technology revolution changes

212
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,519
the world

213
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,760
of course we've seen this before

214
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,479
and the best comparison in many ways is

215
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,640
the revolution we saw

216
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,480
pretty much exactly

217
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,279
150 years ago

218
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,920
the revolution of the electric grid

219
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,920
city of stockholm got its first

220
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,880
electricity crit in 1870.

221
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,680
in 1870 you started replacing the gas

222
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,839
lights around the streets

223
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,680
with electric lights

224
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,720
almost exactly 150 years ago most cities

225
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,200
in europe started installing electric

226
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,839
grids around that time

227
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,600
and during these years during these

228
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,880
decades

229
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,959
electricity

230
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,800
has become

231
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,360
completely mandatory for our societies

232
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,360
today no society

233
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,120
survives without electricity

234
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,680
today when we when we see electricity

235
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,480
cuts or blackouts they're very short

236
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,080
thankfully because if he would have

237
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,320
extended blackouts

238
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,040
days weeks months

239
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,720
years

240
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,760
our societies couldn't function

241
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,920
we can't move around we can't

242
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,800
communicate our factories won't run we

243
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,040
can't feed our people as simple as that

244
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,920
and we are

245
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,959
not there yet

246
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,200
with connectivity

247
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,519
if internet goes down

248
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,680
and stays down

249
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,000
it's not going to stop our society

250
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,880
yes it would be painful yes it would be

251
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,839
very expensive

252
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,519
but we would survive

253
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,399
sas would still be flying their planes

254
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,760
from arlanda

255
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,079
the trams would still be going to

256
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,560
central station

257
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,640
they couldn't be selling tickets online

258
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,000
because there would be no internet but

259
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,480
they could function factories would

260
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,120
continue making food without

261
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,120
connectivity they couldn't do it without

262
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,360
electricity but they can still do it

263
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,040
without connectivity

264
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,120
for now

265
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,240
for a few more years

266
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,560
but it's coming

267
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,120
in 10 years in 20 years connectivity

268
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,399
will be as mandatory for our society as

269
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,160
electricity

270
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,360
connectivity will be as mandatory as

271
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,000
electricity

272
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,240
eventually an internet cut is going to

273
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,200
shut down our society people will start

274
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,480
dying

275
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,680
without connectivity

276
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,200
in fact i could also forecast that

277
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,680
eventually we'll see a time

278
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,519
when

279
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,920
an internet cut

280
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,560
will cut power

281
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,240
right now it works the other way around

282
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,920
if we lose electricity

283
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,839
obviously routers won't run without

284
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,920
electricity so we lose internet as well

285
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,399
what i'm saying is eventually an

286
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,279
internet cut will cut electricity

287
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,640
am i crazy no i'm serious i think this

288
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
will happen because everything will

289
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,560
become interconnected yes it's going to

290
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,839
take a while

291
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,399
but this is the future

292
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,200
that we're headed towards

293
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,120
technology revolution is changing

294
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,440
everything

295
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,360
internet is the best thing and the worst

296
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,560
thing that's happening during our time

297
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,120
and quite often it's the exact same

298
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,839
things which are the best and the worst

299
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,800
things let me give you an example

300
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
when internet came around it changed all

301
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,320
of our lives but

302
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,279
it was especially a big change for

303
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,959
minorities

304
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,360
and here we can think about all possible

305
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,160
kinds of minorities definitely sexual

306
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,480
minorities but even even someone who

307
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,440
just happened to have a rare hobby would

308
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,240
be a minority before the internet if you

309
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,800
were different you were alone

310
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,399
if you were different

311
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,880
you were alone you knew no one else like

312
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,839
you

313
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,560
in your city or town or wherever you

314
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,040
were then the internet comes around and

315
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,959
suddenly you'll find that there's tons

316
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,120
of people just like you who think like

317
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,360
you who are like you they're just far

318
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,480
away

319
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,920
but now you can reach them and this is

320
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,240
great

321
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,360
but then when we look at

322
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,959
destructive

323
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,639
ideologies or destructive minorities

324
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,040
like extremists

325
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,959
or school shooters

326
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,040
or let's say people who dream about

327
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,720
suicide

328
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,600
they will also find exactly the same

329
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,200
kind of support

330
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,360
from exactly the same place from the

331
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,680
forums on the internet it is the best

332
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,160
thing and the worst thing we get both

333
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,360
and we can't just choose the good parts

334
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,839
we get both

335
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,279
and technology

336
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,240
isn't neutral

337
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,680
we quite often get these

338
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,079
claims that you know technology is just

339
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,480
a tool it can be used for good or bad

340
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,120
well yeah true but clearly there are

341
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,200
technologies which are being used much

342
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,160
more

343
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,000
for bad

344
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,399
than good and i don't think technologies

345
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,760
by themselves

346
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,600
are as innocent as we often like to

347
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,399
portray them

348
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,800
but the problem is when we innovate

349
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,199
something we cannot

350
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,800
un-innovate it

351
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,880
when something has been

352
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,839
invented it's with us forever

353
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,240
no matter how much some politicians hate

354
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,839
strong security

355
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,560
aka strong encryption

356
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,320
they can't make it go away because we

357
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,959
have invented it it exists

358
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,040
so the only way it can be restricted is

359
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,199
by making it illegal which

360
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,360
is exactly the wrong thing to do

361
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,800
because if you want to control people

362
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,720
who break the laws you cannot make

363
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,360
things illegal and make them stop

364
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,839
break the law they already are breaking

365
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,399
the laws

366
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,399
i don't think many of us were expecting

367
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,240
what happened on the 24th of february

368
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,000
this year i certainly wasn't

369
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,560
i was reading

370
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,399
the same articles coming from

371
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,120
stories based on uh information

372
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,560
published by

373
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,320
u.s intelligence and uk intelligence in

374
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,639
which they

375
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,800
over and over again said that they have

376
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,040
intelligence which would indicate that

377
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,160
russia would be invading ukraine

378
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,880
i just didn't believe it

379
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,839
a friend of mine dmitry alberovich

380
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,680
i've known him for years and he was

381
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,079
repeating the same thing

382
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,440
you know

383
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,639
russia is preparing to invade

384
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,959
i didn't believe him

385
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,519
why because it made no sense

386
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,120
clearly russia wasn't ready

387
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,800
to invade ukraine

388
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,959
clearly they can't invade ukraine

389
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,120
they're not ready to do it yet they

390
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,959
invaded anyway and yet

391
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,519
they weren't ready so it didn't make any

392
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,120
sense

393
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,639
it was hard to say that this would

394
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,959
happen because it made no sense but they

395
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,920
did it anyway

396
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,240
so now

397
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,320
today

398
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,839
we're faced with the fact that there's a

399
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,639
war in europe

400
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,360
and this is not a far away war this is a

401
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,519
war which is happening

402
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,440
dead center in europe and it's happening

403
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,560
actually

404
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,800
surprisingly close to where we are right

405
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,839
now there are

406
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,920
towns in sweden

407
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,199
which are further away from us right now

408
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,079
than chernobyl ukraine

409
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,040
chernobyl isn't that far away

410
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,279
there's northern towns in lapland in

411
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,880
sweden which are further away than

412
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,360
ukraine

413
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,920
ukraine

414
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,399
has had a long and complicated history

415
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,399
with a very big neighbor as well just

416
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,360
like

417
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,839
we have they have an even longer border

418
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,599
we

419
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,799
finland and sweden we have 1

420
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,439
340 kilometer of border

421
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,039
with the russians i'd like to think of

422
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,439
it as a joint border

423
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,959
that finland and sweden has together

424
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,000
maybe we are sort of like a buffer

425
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,599
between you and russia

426
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,639
something like that

427
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,400
and if one of the reasons why

428
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,559
russia invaded ukraine was to try to

429
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,919
keep nato away from the borders

430
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,200
now as we're joining both nato

431
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,600
russia will more than double

432
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,840
their nato border

433
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,480
and make no mistake we will join

434
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,679
the main reason why our politicians

435
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,480
our prime minister sana marine and our

436
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,440
president saul ninista

437
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
were so

438
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,400
decisive on joining nato

439
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,840
wasn't really

440
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,240
that we needed the support of a military

441
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,160
union or we needed

442
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,559
some kind of assistance

443
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,799
no it really started from talks

444
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,360
late last year where president putin

445
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,120
very straightforwardly said that you

446
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,760
know finland can't join

447
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,480
finland is not free

448
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,640
to make such a decision as if it

449
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,760
wouldn't be our own choice to make

450
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,600
well thank you very much

451
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,840
mr putin it is our own choice to make

452
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,199
and we do make our own choices

453
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,679
so it will happen

454
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,960
so what's the importance

455
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,640
of cyber

456
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,120
in all of this

457
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,160
when you look at the

458
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,240
things that governments do with

459
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,559
offensive cyber tools

460
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,080
clearly the biggest thing they've been

461
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,760
doing for years is

462
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,200
not about

463
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,400
waging war it's about espionage

464
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,400
using offensive cyber tools to spy

465
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,720
or using offensive cyber tools to

466
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,200
collect information for espionage

467
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,360
purposes or for information gathering or

468
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,520
intelligence gathering purposes that's

469
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,120
the number one thing

470
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,360
that governments both in the east and in

471
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,640
the west

472
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,640
have been doing

473
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,559
sure we also have examples where

474
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,960
governments use offensive cyber tools

475
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,480
some of you might call them cyber

476
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,000
weapons

477
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,240
to do sabotage

478
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,160
stocksnet would be a great example of

479
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,080
that

480
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,240
and then there's one more border to

481
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,760
cross and that's

482
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,919
full-blown cyber war

483
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,240
which happens when two countries which

484
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,480
are at war

485
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,640
are launching attacks against each other

486
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,440
using offensive cyber tools

487
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,400
clearly then that is cyber war but i

488
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,720
don't believe we will ever see

489
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,440
a situation where two countries would be

490
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,640
waging only cyber war on each other it's

491
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,640
one of the theaters or one of the

492
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,440
domains for war just like in ukraine

493
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,320
they are fighting on land on sea in air

494
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,840
in space

495
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,000
and in cyber space

496
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,600
in all of them at the same time

497
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,360
it's just a domain

498
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,840
for waging

499
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,760
war but these tools

500
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,520
cyber tools

501
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,159
for war or cyber weapons

502
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,640
are different

503
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,679
from all other weapons

504
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,480
the power of most weapons is not in

505
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,799
using them

506
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,679
but in showing them

507
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,640
it's enough to have the weapons and to

508
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,799
make sure that your enemy knows that you

509
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,039
have the weapons this is the reason why

510
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,760
countries to military parades this is

511
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,320
the reason why you can go to wikipedia

512
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,440
and check any countries air force or

513
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,280
navy and you'll get a listing of how

514
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,799
many fighter jets they have how many

515
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,440
navy ships do they have how many

516
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,360
aircraft carriers

517
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,760
how many tanks this is all public

518
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,880
information

519
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,799
so we have great visibility into

520
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,720
traditional weapons

521
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
because the biggest power of traditional

522
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,080
weapons is in deterrence

523
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,400
if everybody knows you have the weapons

524
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
then you don't need to use the weapons

525
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,080
because they know you have the weapons

526
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,640
the prime example of this is

527
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,880
nuclear no clear weapons

528
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,640
this is the prime example because

529
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,480
nuclear weapons have been used in

530
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,120
mankind's history in war

531
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,960
two times

532
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,720
in 1945.

533
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,559
hiroshima and nagasaki that's it

534
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,960
there are tens of thousands of nuclear

535
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,919
warheads on this planet right now in the

536
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,159
11 countries which have nuclear weapons

537
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,159
today

538
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,120
and the power of those nuclear weapons

539
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,360
obviously is not in using them it's in

540
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,760
having them and everybody knows

541
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,679
who has nuclear weapons it's the

542
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,360
countries which do

543
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,440
nuclear weapons testing

544
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,799
that's why one of the reasons why

545
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,120
testing has been done to show that you

546
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,640
have the capability and by the way

547
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,760
here's a party trick question to you

548
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,559
the question is

549
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,480
when was the last year that russia did a

550
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,600
nuclear weapons test

551
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,000
and then your friends will guess various

552
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,080
years and they will all be wrong because

553
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,400
the answer is never

554
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,640
russia hasn't tested nuclear weapons at

555
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,559
all the last time they tested nuclear

556
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,880
weapons was in 1991

557
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,840
when it was the soviet union

558
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,480
so for more than 30 years

559
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,559
russia hasn't detonated a single nuclear

560
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,120
weapon not even underground

561
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,039
which really makes you wonder if their

562
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,280
nuclear weapons would even work

563
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,559
anymore after 31 years of

564
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,559
corruption and whatever is going on

565
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,360
inside russia

566
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,679
so if cyber weapons

567
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,919
have no deterrence power is there a way

568
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,720
to get deterrence power for them somehow

569
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,640
maybe in the next military parade we

570
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,400
could have a truck

571
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,000
filled with geeks and nerds with

572
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,799
keyboards and

573
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,559
probably not

574
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,480
how could we do it for real

575
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,440
well i guess you could have

576
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,880
a

577
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,240
some kind of a war game

578
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,520
where you would invite outsiders and

579
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,120
representatives from other countries and

580
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,640
then you would show

581
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
how you're launching cyber attacks

582
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,880
against test targets to for example

583
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,200
disable i don't know

584
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,760
air control systems or radar systems

585
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,240
similar to countries that you are

586
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,799
worried about

587
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,159
that would show that you have the

588
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,720
capability but then again

589
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,799
nobody would really believe

590
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,279
what you're doing unless you would show

591
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,159
for real what you're doing not just

592
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,400
showing screens going blank but actually

593
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,760
showing that yeah there's this

594
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,919
vulnerability in this system and here's

595
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,520
how we connect and here's how we exploit

596
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,480
it

597
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,559
and you can't do that

598
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,840
you can't do that because cyber weapons

599
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,799
are the only weapons in the world

600
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,200
which you cannot show to your enemies

601
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,600
because they will get a copy

602
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,279
of your weapons

603
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,640
of your tools just by seeing them

604
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,360
if you show your tanks to your enemy

605
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,919
they don't get a copy of the tanks

606
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,799
but if you show your exploit they do

607
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,760
and this is not just theoretical we have

608
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,240
examples of nation states launching

609
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,360
attacks

610
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,279
against each other using exploits which

611
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,600
are then repurposed by the victim

612
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,840
countries to attack back this has

613
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,919
already happened

614
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,559
it's sort of like if you have two tribes

615
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,080
fighting in the jungle and one of the

616
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,240
tribe doesn't have swords the only thing

617
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,840
they have to do is to wait for the other

618
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,520
tribe to throw swords at them and then

619
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,720
then they do have swords

620
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,240
and this doesn't apply to any other

621
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,360
weapon

622
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,919
and this is made worse by the fact that

623
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,279
cyber

624
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,320
tools

625
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,200
offensive cyber tools have a limited

626
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
shelf life

627
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,640
they have a

628
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,159
best before

629
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,360
date

630
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,640
they expire they rust

631
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,960
they rust just like

632
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,600
real world weapons too

633
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,880
imagine

634
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,600
an effective attack today targeting i

635
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,559
don't know latest linux kernel zero day

636
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,760
in linux kernel right now or in windows

637
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,200
or iphone or some military system

638
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,760
how long will it work

639
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,240
how long will it be effective

640
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,600
a year sure two probably five

641
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,960
in most cases 10 i don't think so 15 no

642
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,039
bugs are found and fixed

643
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,200
vulnerabilities are detected and

644
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,960
corrected

645
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,720
systems change

646
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,880
they are rewritten from scratch and the

647
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,120
things you're targeting will go away so

648
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,279
think about this you have these

649
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,679
offensive tools developed by governments

650
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,400
which are expensive to develop they get

651
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,960
no deterrence value out of them no one

652
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,200
knows they have them and they will die

653
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,360
soon so the whole investment

654
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,480
is thrown

655
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,640
into garbage no one even knows you had

656
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,400
them you had no deterrence value you had

657
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,360
no practical value

658
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,080
cyber weapons are great and awful

659
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,760
as weapons they're great they're

660
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,120
effective

661
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,120
they're affordable they're deniable

662
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,279
that's an excellent combination

663
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,279
but at the same time they provide no

664
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,840
deterrence and they have a much more

665
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,200
limited shelf life than tanks or navy

666
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,120
ships or fighter jets

667
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,080
so during the ukraine conflict

668
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,760
how much have we actually seen

669
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,520
what kind of things have we actually

670
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,918
seen

671
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,679
i guess the best example of

672
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,480
offensive cyber capability

673
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,000
happened in the very beginning of the

674
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,760
war many of you might remember that on

675
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,840
the first days of the war the news

676
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,159
stories were filled with

677
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,919
shootings or or films about ukrainian

678
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,320
women and children queuing on the border

679
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,039
of poland trying to cross the border and

680
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,279
they couldn't get through they were like

681
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,399
massive queues

682
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,679
reporters were

683
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,399
mystified why can't the people leave the

684
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,240
country well the

685
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,480
explanation is that russians had been

686
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,080
using their cyber attacks to wipe

687
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,399
the computers on the ukrainian border

688
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,640
control systems

689
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,960
the borders were open but everything was

690
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,039
done with pen and paper that's why they

691
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,880
had the cues and this is very practical

692
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,679
this is very real world this is what

693
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,559
cyber war looks like in 2022

694
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,080
but it's been fairly quiet for the last

695
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,760
couple of months

696
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,240
before the invasion we saw plenty of

697
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,720
activity during the invasion we saw

698
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,480
plenty of the activity and during the

699
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,760
first weeks maybe the first two months

700
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,120
plenty of activity but it's been

701
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,399
quitting more quiet

702
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,200
and i'm surprised

703
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,520
because russians do have capabilities

704
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,360
but we are not seeing them use them

705
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,640
right now in the middle of this open

706
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,360
public conflict when there are actually

707
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,799
when there's actually a war going on

708
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,919
and the best explanation i have is that

709
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,240
the traditional generals in russian

710
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,480
military who run the war effort right

711
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
now

712
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,919
believe that the role of cyber is in

713
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,399
softening the battlefield before the

714
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,919
attack but then

715
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,600
when the real war starts cyber

716
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,600
takes the back seat

717
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,279
when missiles

718
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,520
start flying and bombs start dropping

719
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,240
and tanks roll over the borders

720
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,200
then cyber takes a back seat

721
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,679
maybe a little bit old school

722
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,080
thinking but that's the explanation i

723
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,399
have

724
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,399
now this is not for the lack of

725
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,600
i mean there has been some attempts

726
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,000
during these months most importantly the

727
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,480
in destroyer 2 attack which we saw in

728
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,039
the end of april

729
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,120
in destroyer 1

730
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,640
was the attack

731
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,000
in 2017 and 18 where

732
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,279
russian military operations cut power at

733
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,080
pricarbato obligo and in

734
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,159
two other obligos

735
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,240
inside ukraine

736
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,640
they tried doing it again

737
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,799
a couple of months ago and they failed

738
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,120
and this is an example on how ukraine

739
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,039
has been successful in defending

740
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,799
themselves

741
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,320
in fact

742
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,240
ukraine is the best best country in

743
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,640
europe

744
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,640
to defend their networks against

745
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,840
nation-state-level attacks

746
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,760
from russia

747
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,919
the number one

748
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,880
they're better than we are or you are or

749
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,760
germany or france or uk

750
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,960
they're the best

751
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,840
why

752
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,279
because they've been doing it for eight

753
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,360
years

754
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,200
they've been doing it for eight years

755
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,760
day in day out

756
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,600
there's the old law that you become a

757
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,559
world class expert after doing 10 000

758
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,279
hours of something the ukrainian cyber

759
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,559
defenders have done their 10 000 hours

760
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,399
they are world class experts

761
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,240
and there's been plenty of things to

762
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,480
learn from

763
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,120
many of you remember this photo

764
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,200
from 2018 it's the not petty attack you

765
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
see not petty

766
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,720
screens in this supermarket cashier

767
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,240
systems

768
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,039
and i went back to my notes

769
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,158
to 2018

770
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,159
because i wanted to find out where this

771
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,600
photo was taken

772
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,440
well it was taken in a supermarket chain

773
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,720
called rost and this photo

774
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,360
is from rostharkev

775
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,440
in harcover

776
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,120
in southern ukraine

777
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,919
so i googled rust harkev

778
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,760
it was bombed

779
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,080
three months ago by the russians so the

780
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,200
very same supermarket was hit first by a

781
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,480
cyber attack then by a real world

782
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,919
attack

783
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,480
this is what cyber war

784
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,720
looks like

785
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,360
what about then the attackers who are

786
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,480
not

787
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,399
part of the government

788
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,760
there's been plenty of talks about

789
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,679
civilians

790
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,760
including organized crime gangs who

791
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,480
support their countries and about

792
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,720
activists and activists both from the

793
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,600
west

794
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,159
as well as from russia

795
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,039
what's their role

796
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,559
well many of the most visible

797
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,640
patriotic haggar troops

798
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,159
from russia

799
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,559
disappeared or sorry appeared out of

800
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,640
nowhere in the beginning of the war

801
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,159
kilnett hacknet and no name 57 are all

802
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,399
example of groups like these

803
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,200
they

804
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
are not part of the government

805
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,240
they're not trying to make money

806
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,120
but they are trying to target

807
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,440
targets they believe would help

808
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,960
russia in this war

809
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,519
they communicate

810
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,399
over telegram or in tor hidden service

811
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,360
chats

812
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,679
and they synchronize attacks against

813
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,600
targets they believe

814
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
would make

815
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,760
some difference for russia in this war

816
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,960
effort

817
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,399
and since they are not trying to make

818
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,200
money that makes them a different group

819
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,000
from

820
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,399
the organized crime groups operating

821
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,320
from russia

822
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,600
most famously group conti

823
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,200
now conti has

824
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,279
this banned

825
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,519
roughly three months ago we believe most

826
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,080
of the county members now are active

827
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,519
parts of other

828
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,760
organized crime groups in russia such as

829
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,840
lockpit

830
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,239
but they famously aligned themselves

831
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,000
with the russian government on the very

832
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,359
beginning of the war this is a

833
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,760
screenshot i took from the tor hidden

834
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,000
service website of conti

835
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,560
on the 25th of february when the war

836
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,280
started on the 24th and they aligned

837
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,879
themselves

838
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,960
with the russian government

839
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,119
so what does that mean in practice

840
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,918
well here's a bigger screenshot

841
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,960
three weeks later from the same site

842
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,960
it's the site they use as their league

843
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,918
site

844
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,040
where they

845
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,760
use leaks from their victim companies as

846
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,719
a way

847
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,879
to force them into paying ransom

848
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,440
one of the companies listed on the page

849
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,079
is called nordex what's this

850
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,599
what does nordics do

851
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,000
well nordex is a german company actually

852
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,920
originally dalish company but then

853
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,320
bought by a german company

854
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,720
which is one of the largest energy

855
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,800
creation and distribution companies in

856
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,880
europe

857
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,440
and this is a recurring

858
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,119
theme

859
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,040
we've also seen

860
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,320
russian attackers especially hacknet

861
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,920
hack into

862
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,720
and do data leaks from companies like

863
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,359
d-tec and d-tec is one of the largest

864
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,320
energy providers inside ukraine

865
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,839
why are these gangs

866
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,680
targeting energy distribution and energy

867
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,000
creation in europe

868
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,599
because one of the weapons in this war

869
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,160
is energy

870
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,800
one of the main ways russia can affect

871
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,520
us the rest of europe is through

872
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,960
russian oil

873
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,359
coal and gas and the better they can

874
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,400
disrupt operations with european energy

875
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,440
energy distributors or energy creators

876
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,680
the better it is for them so for these

877
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,000
criminal gangs it's

878
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,560
it's a win-win scenario they make money

879
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,079
but they're also helping their

880
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,359
motherland

881
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,520
by choosing which victims or which kind

882
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,119
of victims

883
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,359
they're targeting

884
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,759
so the world is changing

885
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,920
if you go back

886
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,280
and think about how the world changed

887
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,839
in the second world war

888
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,880
well the war ended

889
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,320
between the united states and japan

890
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,079
with the nuclear

891
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,480
holocaust

892
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,720
and it's quite easy to say

893
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,440
that nuclear physicists

894
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,160
people working with nuclear physics

895
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,920
lost their innocence in 1945

896
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,920
exactly in the same way we

897
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,160
computer scientists we've

898
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,400
lost our innocence exactly in the same

899
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,599
way as

900
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,200
our research area has now become

901
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,359
a tool for conflicts

902
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,320
and a tool for wars

903
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,800
and there's no going back

904
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,760
once again we cannot uninvent

905
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,880
things which have been invented

906
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,880
so is it all bad news

907
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,359
are we

908
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,800
only seeing

909
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,359
doom and gloom

910
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,400
in our area of expertise which is

911
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,440
computer security

912
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,920
well no

913
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,720
you see i'm an optimist

914
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,320
and that might be

915
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,640
surprising because i've spent 31 years

916
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,440
working with the worst parts of the

917
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,040
internet

918
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,960
with the scum of the internet with the

919
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,119
criminals the attackers

920
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,720
the worst

921
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,040
aspects of this technology revolution

922
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,839
yet i am an optimist about the future

923
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,280
i believe

924
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,040
that the security of our systems has

925
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,680
never been better

926
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,359
i believe that the security of the

927
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,520
computers you use day in day out has

928
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,320
never been better

929
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,960
and i know it doesn't look like it

930
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,560
the reason why it doesn't look like it

931
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,520
is that

932
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,960
only the bad news are news

933
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,000
imagine you yourself or i don't know the

934
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,640
i.t team in your organization

935
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,560
learning about a new vulnerability

936
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,040
affecting your systems and then

937
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,839
working through the night

938
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,920
patching everything making sure all

939
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,839
systems are

940
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,480
updated and fixed and updated and

941
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,000
patched

942
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,640
and they finish patching the last server

943
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,160
at 6am

944
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,880
and then at 7am an outside attacker

945
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,200
scans through your ip range

946
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,800
looking for vulnerable machines and they

947
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,320
find none

948
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,599
you're safe

949
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,320
nothing happened

950
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,640
these guys these guys these girls maybe

951
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,680
you

952
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,720
did a heroic thing

953
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,520
and no one will know

954
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,000
because the only thing that happened

955
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,160
because of the work they did was nothing

956
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,040
and i can guarantee to you that

957
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,320
tomorrow's

958
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,119
newspapers here in sweden will not have

959
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,400
a headline

960
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,320
which says that the second largest

961
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,079
company in sweden

962
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,000
was not hacked yesterday

963
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,079
that's not news

964
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,880
when a company gets hacked that is

965
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,000
news so we only see the failures

966
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,240
and it's easy to see

967
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,560
only the bad sides but the truth is our

968
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,560
security is better than ever

969
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,640
and one of the biggest changes

970
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,320
in there has been new operating systems

971
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,079
ios is 15 years old

972
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,640
in many ways

973
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,680
this

974
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,640
has exactly the same

975
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,640
or similar platform

976
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,119
than a games console

977
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,160
this is a playstation or an xbox

978
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,640
a playstation or an xbox is obviously a

979
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,480
computer xbox even runs windows

980
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,400
but you never hear about viruses or

981
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,680
worms or hacks on playstations do you

982
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,680
no because it is a computer which is

983
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,400
shut down closed down you can't program

984
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,079
it yourself even though you own the box

985
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,320
you can't program it exactly the same

986
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,640
thing applies here

987
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,640
and that's a very very restrictive model

988
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,640
but it's also secure

989
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,040
model

990
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,359
how can you say it's secure when we've

991
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,520
all seen the headlines about

992
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,440
pegasus from nso infecting iphones

993
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,839
belonging to ministers and parliament

994
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,720
members and meps

995
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,319
well

996
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,240
this my friends this

997
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,960
is not a security failure

998
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,440
no this is a security success story

999
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,640
this is a success story why because it

1000
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,960
costs 100 000 euros

1001
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,480
to hack an iphone with pegasus

1002
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,800
how much does it cost to hack

1003
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,359
your windows laptop

1004
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:32,720
like you know

1005
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,439
10 crooner

1006
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,119
which means

1007
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,560
your phone only gets targeted if you are

1008
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,760
worth 100 000 euros for an attacker and

1009
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,119
here

1010
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,119
the only attackers using this tool are

1011
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,720
governmental attackers so you don't have

1012
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,160
to worry about criminals only

1013
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,839
governments

1014
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,000
most of us will never be targeted by a

1015
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,599
foreign government if the price for

1016
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,359
targeting our phone

1017
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,359
is 100 000 euros they might target our

1018
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,040
computers but they won't target our

1019
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,560
phones this is a success story

1020
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,839
so i've been a computer security guy all

1021
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,359
my life

1022
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,319
practically all my life ever since i was

1023
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,640
21 years old

1024
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,880
i was 21 when i reverse engineered my

1025
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,960
first malware i still have it with me

1026
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,240
because i always carry it here

1027
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,960
i even have my tailor make my suits

1028
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,520
exactly the right size so i can fit a

1029
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,960
five and quarter inch floppy disk into

1030
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,800
my pocket

1031
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,440
true story

1032
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,400
so i've thought

1033
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,599
for

1034
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,800
decades

1035
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,400
that my job is to secure computers

1036
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,960
i'm a computer security guy i secure

1037
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,720
computers

1038
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,240
but slowly

1039
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,839
i've started to realize that today

1040
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,400
everything runs on computers

1041
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,119
as i explained in the beginning

1042
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,400
connectivity

1043
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,640
is becoming the new electricity our

1044
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,480
societies

1045
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,119
run on computers which means my job

1046
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,240
your job our job

1047
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,240
is no longer to secure computers it is

1048
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,800
to secure the society

1049
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,599
that's our job

1050
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,079
thank you very much

1051
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,319
thank you mikko um

1052
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,920
you get to keep flopping

1053
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,079
what is it is it warm yeah it's warm

1054
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,560
it's form

1055
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,520
ah it doesn't fit i've talked to my

1056
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,560
tailor

1057
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,319
i'll i'll send my tailor's contact

1058
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,920
information

1059
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,920
what do you um

1060
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,079
what's your definition of cyber war

1061
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,720
you said it's not cyber words sometimes

1062
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,400
it's

1063
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,599
uh sabotage if one country is attacking

1064
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,760
with all his might another country it is

1065
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,640
no kinetic war is that a cyber war or is

1066
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,200
it just acts of sabotage

1067
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,240
well

1068
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,560
maybe the discussion on the exact words

1069
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,599
is a bit academic but i actually do

1070
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:24,880
believe

1071
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,520
that words matter and i strongly do

1072
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,319
believe that if something isn't war we

1073
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,119
shouldn't be calling it a war

1074
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,720
and right now

1075
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,880
we see a massive

1076
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,960
um

1077
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,319
devaluation of the word

1078
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,960
war because it's not just cases like

1079
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,680
cyber sabotage which gets labeled as war

1080
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,359
even things like

1081
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:48,800
phishing attacks launched by a

1082
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,319
government and against another

1083
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,839
government to steal information it's

1084
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,599
called cyber war when it clearly isn't

1085
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,839
cyber war it's intelligence gathering or

1086
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:56,960
spying

1087
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,319
spying isn't war espionage isn't war

1088
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,000
spying is spying espionage is espionage

1089
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,920
and if two countries are not at war i

1090
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,000
don't see how they could be doing cyber

1091
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,599
war against each other and that means in

1092
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,480
my book stuxnet wasn't cyber war it was

1093
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,400
cyber sabotage however if usa and israel

1094
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,960
would have been at war with iran then

1095
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,359
exactly the same attack would have been

1096
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:22,720
cyber war because then there would have

1097
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,240
been a war

1098
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,000
so it has to be kinetic to be able to be

1099
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,880
cyber as well it has to be happening in

1100
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,560
other domains in addition to cyber so

1101
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,359
and it's not enough that it would be a

1102
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,040
cold war

1103
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,880
for it to also be a cyber war there has

1104
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,680
to be something real in my book

1105
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,040
it's interesting to think what will be

1106
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,480
the next domain

1107
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,200
i mentioned we have like land war air

1108
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,839
war sea war space war cyber space war

1109
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,680
it's not going to end here we have five

1110
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,359
domains today

1111
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,599
it's gonna it's kind of interesting to

1112
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,599
speculate what the sixth

1113
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,680
domain will be right now we have no idea

1114
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,680
the only thing we know is that whatever

1115
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,760
the sixth domain will be

1116
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,520
it's going to sound like science fiction

1117
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,319
today just like cyber war sounded like

1118
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,119
science fiction 30 years ago so it could

1119
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,359
be i don't know

1120
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:16,400
nano warfare where

1121
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,680
enemies distributing airborne air cell

1122
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,240
size tiny robots which enter your

1123
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,560
bloodstream and change your thoughts and

1124
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,880
if that sounds like science fiction

1125
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,800
exactly that's what cyber war sounded

1126
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,960
like 30 years ago

1127
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,000
fair enough

1128
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,079
do we have questions from slido uh we do

1129
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,599
have questions from the lawyers one you

1130
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,520
already just answered which is like

1131
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,319
which is going to be the next big domain

1132
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,960
so we're going to skip that um but one

1133
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,160
uh question you were mentioning

1134
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,480
like yeah cyber weapons doesn't have

1135
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,720
deterrence uh but do you think the nato

1136
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,319
exercises like the locked shield

1137
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,640
exercises are they

1138
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,800
a way of trying to build the deterrence

1139
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,680
through cyber warfare um

1140
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,560
yeah maybe in one way they could be i

1141
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,520
don't think locked shields and similar

1142
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,839
rehearsals and competitions

1143
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,680
have been built for that purpose but of

1144
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,280
course they do showcase capabilities

1145
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,640
but the vast majority of our

1146
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,960
capabilities remain hidden i call this

1147
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,359
the fog of the cyber war it's quite

1148
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:20,720
clear to see which are the best

1149
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,319
countries in offensive capability i

1150
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:23,520
don't think anybody really argues

1151
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,520
against usa being number one they've

1152
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,280
spent more money longer than any anyone

1153
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,520
else building offensive capabilities and

1154
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,760
it's clear that israel is pretty good

1155
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,440
russia has lots of capability china has

1156
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,800
lots of capabilities but then when you

1157
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,599
go

1158
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,760
beyond that to smaller countries what's

1159
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,520
the offensive cyber capability of

1160
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,640
vietnam

1161
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,640
or south korea

1162
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,640
be it's me and you can't google for it

1163
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,440
either so it's it's kind of hard to

1164
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,079
really really see where the real things

1165
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,880
are happening now the

1166
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,200
the deterrence value

1167
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,720
is one thing about

1168
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,640
uh rehearsals like log shields which is

1169
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,440
a nato uh rehearsal there's another

1170
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,760
thing which is also being built in these

1171
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,760
rehearsals and in

1172
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,040
nato research centers like like the

1173
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,319
ccdcoe the center of excellence in

1174
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:13,359
tallinn which is the rules

1175
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:17,920
of war or laws of war for cyber war

1176
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,040
which we will be needing today we have

1177
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,839
rules of war for real world war like

1178
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,480
you're not supposed to bomb hospitals

1179
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,640
you're not supposed to use chemical

1180
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,040
weapons like these kind of rules and i

1181
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,359
do believe that eventually we will have

1182
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,760
rules of war for cyber war

1183
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,359
things like

1184
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,200
when you distribute

1185
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,800
offensive cyber cyber tools malware

1186
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,319
backdoors they must not continue working

1187
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:49,200
and spreading forever there must be a

1188
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,640
kill date

1189
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,160
sort of similar like you would wish to

1190
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,240
have a kill date in land mines so when

1191
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,319
the war is over they would no longer be

1192
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,640
killing civilians clearly you can easily

1193
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,800
program things like these into these

1194
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,640
offensive tools and i think

1195
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,200
they will become the norm i also believe

1196
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,960
that we will eventually see

1197
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,280
some kind of identification requirement

1198
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,119
that when you deploy

1199
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,119
tools offensive cyber tools as a

1200
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,200
government you must

1201
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,960
sign them somehow

1202
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,160
maybe not so that during the conflict

1203
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,839
you would show who's behind them but

1204
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,280
then after the conflict you could prove

1205
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,280
that this was ours this was ours that

1206
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,440
was yours this was ours things like that

1207
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,119
which you could easily do with encrypted

1208
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,000
blobs inside the binaries i think things

1209
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,839
like these will become

1210
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:37,119
a part of the future of conflicts

1211
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:38,480
you mean like a

1212
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,559
private public key scheme was like oh

1213
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,160
that's signed by the us

1214
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,440
something like that just like in the

1215
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,800
real world where you're supposed to have

1216
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,920
the flag

1217
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,839
in in your uniform to show who you are

1218
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,920
fighting for something like that but

1219
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,920
deniability is one of the main features

1220
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,079
of it that's why it's unlikely to be

1221
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,280
deployed

1222
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,720
so that you could tell during the

1223
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,559
conflict who's doing what but then after

1224
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,400
the conflict you could prove that this

1225
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,000
was ours or maybe someone else could

1226
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,920
prove that this was yours five years

1227
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,160
after the fact so we could now know for

1228
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,040
real that stocks that was usa and israel

1229
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,480
if they would have implemented something

1230
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,880
like that but since they haven't we all

1231
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,359
know it's usa and israel but we can't

1232
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,839
prove it

1233
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,200
um okay uh i think do we have any more

1234
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,559
questions from

1235
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,160
the audience there's a question right

1236
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,720
over here okay

1237
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,520
hi

1238
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,079
thank you for a really good speech

1239
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,319
i wanted to hang on to the deterrent

1240
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:40,400
part

1241
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,800
why can't a nation-state-sponsored

1242
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,680
attack be part of the deterrent because

1243
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,000
that's the sort of way to show their

1244
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,160
muscles or the muscles or the

1245
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,079
intelligence that they carry in that

1246
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,960
country

1247
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,720
when we look at

1248
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,200
cyber attacks nation-state cyber attacks

1249
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,839
which have been caught

1250
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:04,319
the vast majority of them are from

1251
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,760
russia and china that's one of the

1252
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,599
reasons why russia and china are seeing

1253
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,319
so big players in cyber when they

1254
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,079
actually are

1255
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,920
quite a lot behind in technical

1256
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,520
capabilities

1257
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,319
behind for example usa and israel in

1258
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,040
based on on my understanding

1259
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,319
and the reason i believe is that

1260
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,720
russia and china don't really care about

1261
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,160
getting caught

1262
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,480
western intelligence agencies western

1263
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,240
governments western militaries think

1264
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,240
it's embarrassing

1265
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,640
to get caught they go to great lengths

1266
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,839
to make sure

1267
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,359
that whatever they're doing in this

1268
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:40,319
space

1269
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:41,839
doesn't get caught or if it's caught it

1270
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,559
cannot be attributed back to them

1271
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,200
however in the cases

1272
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,400
where they have been caught or when

1273
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,640
there's been leaks about these

1274
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,480
capabilities from western intelligence

1275
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,760
agencies i think they've been quite

1276
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,000
happy to take the credit because that

1277
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,680
has given them the deterrence that they

1278
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,520
can't get any other way

1279
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,040
but like i said

1280
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,119
it's unlikely that governments would be

1281
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:06,319
voluntarily getting deterrence by

1282
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:08,000
showing their weapons because then they

1283
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,800
are giving the tools to their enemies

1284
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,480
because these weapons

1285
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,880
can be copied and deployed unlike any

1286
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,839
other real world weapons

1287
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:20,800
but actually the intelligence behind the

1288
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,040
ones that are using the tools

1289
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,680
you are not giving away them

1290
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,359
and if you are going to show the

1291
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,599
intelligence it's like doing the parades

1292
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:30,880
so they are holding back to old

1293
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,200
old-school deterrent

1294
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,960
ways kind of

1295
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,599
couldn't it be the case

1296
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,319
certainly countries can show the end

1297
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,319
results of what they have accomplished

1298
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,160
with these tools but that's a different

1299
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,359
story that's not really getting

1300
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:47,680
deterrence from the weapons it's getting

1301
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,400
deterrence from things you can do

1302
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,880
and that's

1303
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,359
we cannot compare the way we build

1304
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:56,880
deterrence with real world weapons so

1305
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,400
the way we build deterrence with cyber

1306
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,680
weapons

1307
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,599
i don't think we'll see a day where

1308
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,440
countries are voluntarily showing the

1309
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,280
technical details

1310
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,319
of their cyber weapons it wouldn't it

1311
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,079
would make no sense

1312
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:11,280
i think

1313
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,520
thank you

1314
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,160
a ctf competition would be

1315
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:18,960
a

1316
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,520
military parade of the cyber domain

1317
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,079
because you're not showing the result

1318
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,000
you're not showing a certain exploit but

1319
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,520
you're showing the capability of

1320
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,520
creating

1321
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,680
such an exploit so what you're saying is

1322
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,079
that finland got a bit of deterrence

1323
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,240
when our finnish team won the locked

1324
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,160
shields rehearsal

1325
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,000
something like that

1326
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,680
we'll take it thank you

1327
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,440
you're very welcome yeah

1328
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,240
yeah us

1329
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,319
okay any more questions

1330
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,319
do you have any more questions i was

1331
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,160
thinking something but you caught me of

1332
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,280
course like

1333
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,800
who solves this first you guys are the

1334
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,200
russians

1335
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,720
do you think that is

1336
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,440
um

1337
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,960
yeah i'm curious do have you heard

1338
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,680
anything about how much the you know

1339
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,440
finland is looking to expand its cyber

1340
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,680
capabilities now that you know nato is

1341
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,160
on the doorstep or nato is

1342
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,319
becoming part of reality

1343
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,000
we just got a

1344
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,839
major improvement in budgets

1345
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,079
to be put into this area

1346
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,319
so yeah we are looking to improve our

1347
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:27,040
capabilities here definitely

1348
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,400
but that's just

1349
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,319
that's all we know for so far but

1350
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:31,680
finally we are seeing the kind of

1351
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,839
budgets we should have been seeing

1352
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:35,599
years ago so

1353
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:36,559
that's the way you're flexing the

1354
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,119
muscles as well it is yes yeah very true

1355
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:42,559
good

1356
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:47,240
okay thank you very much thank you
