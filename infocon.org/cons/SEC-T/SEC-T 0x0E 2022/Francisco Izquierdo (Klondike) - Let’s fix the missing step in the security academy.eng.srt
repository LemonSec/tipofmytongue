1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,520
so my talk is going to be about the most

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,919
boring topic ever you probably are going

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,840
to run from here right now

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,599
i'm going to talk about

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,280
what is known as the

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,960
academy to industry job pipeline

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,000
so i want to start asking one question

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,320
who here of all the people that we have

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,880
here has managed to get a job in the

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,720
security industry

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,480
without actually getting help from

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,679
somebody that was already in the

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,439
security industry

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,520
raise your hands

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,960
one two three four i second five six

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,000
people seven seven people

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,600
yeah as you can see this is obviously

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,280
not working quite well most of the

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,879
people here get in because somebody

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,120
actually pulls them in and tells hey you

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,239
seem to be good at what you're doing

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,760
come and help us

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,160
but if you go then there to where they

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,239
are having all of these stunts they will

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,520
show you that they have all of these

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,680
cool internship programs and stuff like

27
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,719
that

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,480
but they obviously are not reaching the

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,000
right people

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
so this is exactly what happens when you

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,320
get a person that is interested in

32
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,159
security taking studies at the

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,520
university

34
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,479
they go

35
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,320
they take all of the security courses

36
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,240
they can find obviously because that's

37
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,080
what they want to do

38
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,759
they do a lot of individual training

39
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,640
maybe they do ctfs maybe they do hack

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,720
boxes or other kind of stuff in order to

41
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,840
get everything that they need to know

42
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,240
then they go and find an entry-level job

43
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,320
no wait no that's that's exactly the

44
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,799
missing step so when they try to find an

45
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,040
entry-level job obviously

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,600
they only see senior positions

47
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,799
senior positions everywhere i mean

48
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,079
i'm not sure if you have tried to do

49
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,079
that but if you want you can try now

50
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,000
pick whichever job

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,520
announcement portal you want to look

52
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,680
enter the keyword security

53
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,439
and look how many years of experience

54
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,880
they ask on every job it's usually

55
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,360
around five at least

56
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,720
so

57
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,920
yeah

58
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,680
we have a problem in that

59
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,079
there is a

60
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,799
a

61
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,799
a five year experience cup that

62
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,560
obviously there is no way of breaching

63
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,598
if nobody helps you to get in

64
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,920
there are different expectations on how

65
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,760
depositions should be

66
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,599
should be or different students have

67
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,120
different ways

68
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,200
of looking for things they look for

69
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,599
different words

70
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,720
so

71
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,800
the problem is that every single time

72
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,360
since i started doing my phd

73
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,640
students have come to me with the

74
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,560
following question

75
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,480
so francisco you have been working on

76
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,560
the industry can you give us a list of

77
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,160
companies or something that we can apply

78
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
to

79
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,319
well the first year i had no such list

80
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,120
and it was kind of pandemic

81
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,480
the second year it was even more

82
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,800
pandemic but then i came to sectee and i

83
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,560
made a small list

84
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,800
and eventually because i was bored and i

85
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,080
wanted to see some people there and i

86
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,680
wanted to have an excuse to do something

87
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,680
that is not working like every other phd

88
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,280
student in the world

89
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,959
i went to

90
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,560
a charm

91
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,840
charm is a basically

92
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,120
um see if i can find the right word a

93
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,120
workfare that is organized at chalmers

94
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,400
that's the university where i am working

95
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,680
every year

96
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,319
so i went and i interviewed pretty much

97
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,400
everybody i could find i want to stand

98
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,640
there and i went like hey do you have

99
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,599
security jobs yes we do do you have

100
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,080
entry-level security jobs

101
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,040
some said yes some said no

102
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,440
i asked a few some questions and that's

103
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,959
how you end up with that webpage that

104
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,480
you can see on the bottom

105
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,319
so if you want to look for jobs on

106
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,599
security

107
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,519
it's not a complete list but it's a good

108
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,360
way to start

109
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,120
but what do we do now

110
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,040
well

111
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,519
we need to go further than this i mean

112
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,360
we need to add geographical information

113
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,040
students might not be able to relocate

114
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,400
to other places when they finish their

115
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,840
studies

116
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,840
they we need also to be able to provide

117
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,840
them link contact details or something

118
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,200
that they can check if they want to know

119
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,439
more about what they can do there

120
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,200
there are as we said different position

121
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,879
types some people might want to look for

122
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,040
a summer job other people might want to

123
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,720
look for a

124
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,040
master's thesis or a graduate test is

125
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
others look for an internship or a union

126
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,319
position

127
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,920
and the most important thing this list

128
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,599
is going to be useless

129
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,639
is if it still contains the data of chan

130
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,519
2022 in five years from now

131
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,079
so it needs to be fresh data

132
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,280
and that's what i'm doing this talk

133
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,759
because i really really hope that the

134
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,360
youth who are attending and are not the

135
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,520
students can give me a hand

136
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,960
so

137
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,600
this is my email address

138
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,080
if you send me any offer that is for an

139
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,840
entry level position on security i

140
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,759
promise i will publish it on that list

141
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,080
as soon as i read your email

142
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,240
if you know people that are actually

143
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,120
looking for entry-level people please

144
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,040
tell them to mail me because obviously

145
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,800
if you send me the position i cannot do

146
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,160
that for you

147
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,400
and if you have students or

148
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,919
know people that are looking for to

149
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,080
start on security please feel free to

150
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,520
send my website that specific web page

151
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,919
so that's it

152
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,080
i have to say like the obligatory thanks

153
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,880
my research is being funded by msb

154
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,440
and by chalmers and you so yeah that's

155
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,719
basically it thank you
