1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,640
hello everyone i'm uh paul kagan from

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,240
huntsville alabama it's wonderful to be

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,360
back in sweden again

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,440
so we're going to talk about

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,519
this presentation pond in space we're

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,720
going to

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,080
dive into some

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,039
the topics around how space and cyber

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,400
are converging

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,840
and all the opportunities that are going

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,600
to be out there for us as a cyber

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,400
security industry to go and help

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,720
secure this new space infrastructure

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,880
that is being uh

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,160
deployed

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,960
very rapidly

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,160
today

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,920
so

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,520
a lot of conversation

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,879
everyone today in enterprise and other

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,600
vertical markets are you know deploying

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,600
uh cloud security

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,160
deploying cloud systems pushing you know

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,840
what used to be in our private data

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,239
centers up to the cloud well

26
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,840
the same thing's happening with the

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,520
space industry

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,600
where the ground stations that used to

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,879
be private and isolated and probably ran

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,360
are now being moved to the cloud we have

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,760
uh companies called like leaf space out

32
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,799
of italy

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,560
kubos who runs their major tom ground

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,439
station service on amazon aws

35
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,400
there's amazon aws is also into the

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,960
space ground station business microsoft

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,000
azure

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,159
they have their orbit offering where

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,479
they're offering ground station services

40
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,600
and uh

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,920
my understanding is now google is

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,040
managing

43
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,240
the

44
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,159
offering the ground station services for

45
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,439
spacex

46
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,360
so think of the ground station is like

47
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,520
your noc your network operation center

48
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,439
your security operations center well the

49
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,600
satellites the spacecraft they have the

50
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,880
ground

51
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,600
uh station

52
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,200
that operates their networks and these

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,720
ground stations are getting deployed

54
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,640
around the world so that they can have

55
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,640
continuous coverage depending on where

56
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,280
things are in orbit

57
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,520
now

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,600
it makes makes even

59
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,520
easy sense that uh with everything

60
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,560
moving to the cloud here on earth

61
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,280
like amazon google et cetera

62
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,800
that all makes sense

63
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,480
just got to go get it all secure but

64
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,959
what's fascinating me

65
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,400
from a cyber security professional

66
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,440
standpoint

67
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,959
is also

68
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,520
is now the data centers that we used to

69
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,680
have just on earth are now moving the

70
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,840
space there's companies like leo cloud

71
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,239
and others that are actually

72
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,879
voting their business plan is to launch

73
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,800
satellites and be able to provide

74
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,480
cloud-based services

75
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,640
up in space now and from a cyber

76
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,080
security standpoint

77
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,920
the questions i have is how are we going

78
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,239
to do forensics and incident response

79
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,920
and deal with incidents

80
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,480
in space as the cloud gets deployed up

81
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,239
in space it's going to make open up a

82
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,120
whole

83
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,120
new world of uh

84
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,959
of problems to solve

85
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,800
new services to provide

86
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,959
new applications products

87
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,519
a lot of new thoughts

88
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,040
as our cloud moves to space now part of

89
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,440
the technologies are enabling that is

90
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,959
there's companies like out of israel

91
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,920
called uh rahman space they've developed

92
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,159
a terabyte hard drive that's radiation

93
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,599
hardened

94
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,840
they can survive the hostile environment

95
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,400
in space that i'll go more in

96
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,000
detail about

97
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,760
so with this radiation hardened hard

98
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,840
drive it can go and

99
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,120
tolerate like the solar storms

100
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,720
all the

101
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,560
cosmic rays etc

102
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,920
that are uh

103
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,760
out in space it can we can better

104
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,280
survive that and where we don't lose our

105
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,480
data so

106
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,200
so the higher storage capabilities are

107
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,120
moving to space here

108
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,640
now this really got my attention when i

109
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,159
ran across this doing the research for

110
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,440
this presentation

111
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,519
is i knew about lava tunnels i seen lava

112
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,959
tunnels in hawaii

113
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,200
from the volcanoes on the big island in

114
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,440
hawaii but i had no idea that there was

115
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,599
a such thing as a lava tunnel on the

116
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,480
moon

117
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,640
and this come this company lone star

118
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,439
here

119
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,680
they're actually looking at utilizing

120
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,640
lava tunnels that exist on the moon and

121
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,120
putting data centers inside these lava

122
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,080
tunnels

123
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,920
and providing services and the reason

124
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,519
they're going to use these lava tunnels

125
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,879
is like i said we'll go into some more

126
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,440
detail here in a few slides about how

127
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,720
hostile

128
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,600
space weather is up in space due to the

129
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,400
sun and other sources of cosmic rays

130
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,280
so

131
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,080
by putting uh the data centers into the

132
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,320
tunnel into the lava tunnels they're

133
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,479
hoping to be able to shield their

134
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,919
equipment

135
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,400
from from some of that space weather

136
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,840
but somebody's got to put that and put

137
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,360
this technology in those tunnels and

138
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,400
what they're looking at doing is using

139
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,240
robots so i wanted to just give you an

140
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,440
overview of that

141
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,360
because as cyber security

142
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,000
professionals network i.t professionals

143
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,600
we're about to have uh techno we're

144
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,080
about to have our networks on the moon

145
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,360
in lava tunnels i find it very

146
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,520
interesting now

147
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,199
i'm an old-school network guy my

148
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,520
expertise is primarily in network

149
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,960
telecommunications service provider

150
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,280
networks and this is what really

151
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,680
this type of thinking here is really got

152
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,400
me

153
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,520
interested in space is uh networks like

154
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,600
what ntt

155
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,720
is uh planning to build where ntt the

156
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,240
telecommunications company out of japan

157
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
they're planning to build out a network

158
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,919
where satellites are interconnected

159
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,520
optically with

160
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,320
free space optics free space lasers

161
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,400
where wherever instead of rf everything

162
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,199
is communicating with lasers in

163
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,440
in between the satellites and to the

164
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,600
ground and also have storage

165
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,120
capabilities in space where they can

166
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,680
have data center capabilities on the

167
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,360
satellites so this is really really

168
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,120
fascinating where we're heading where we

169
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,880
can have the whole

170
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,240
what looks like architected a

171
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,680
telecommunications network that would

172
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,840
normally be fiber interconnected on them

173
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,560
on the ground that is uh

174
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,400
running lasers to interconnect the

175
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,320
satellites and back to the ground with

176
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,199
data data storage capabilities all up in

177
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,240
space my understanding is is ntt is

178
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,720
looking around 2025 to get start getting

179
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,120
this network consolation built

180
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,840
so it's really interesting but

181
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,160
so but we're here to talk about security

182
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,400
so we've got the slide on the counter

183
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,479
space continuum what you have from a

184
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,319
cyber threat standpoint for the far left

185
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,520
you have

186
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,280
what's typically referred to is

187
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,240
electronic warfare

188
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,720
direct you know directed energy

189
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,160
attacks that

190
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,720
go away when you remove the power you

191
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,280
could go in and start jamming a signal

192
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,800
start interfering with communications

193
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,000
on a

194
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,039
satellite

195
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,880
and it'll go away as soon as as you

196
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,840
remove the power farm so it's reversible

197
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,840
but as you move further to the right you

198
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,759
start getting more kinetic where the

199
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,840
attacks are physical and there's been a

200
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,400
lot of examples in the news where

201
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,919
missiles have been launched to

202
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,080
satellites and destroying satellites and

203
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,599
what happens with that when you do these

204
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,599
kinetic attacks it

205
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,840
creates debris in space and creates a

206
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,000
large debris field and there's a concern

207
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,599
now as we move forward to ride with

208
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,240
these those type of attacks

209
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,360
that

210
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,199
there may be end up being a large enough

211
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,599
debris field that eventually there could

212
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,599
be a chain reaction called

213
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,960
cause

214
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,520
resulting called a kessler syndrome

215
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,199
where the chain reaction one piece of

216
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,319
debris or

217
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,400
spacecraft hits another debris or

218
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,759
spacecraft and it just starts

219
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,240
replicating until we have such a large

220
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,680
debris field

221
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,919
that that the lower earth orbit is no

222
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,160
longer usable so that's called a kessler

223
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,000
syndrome as you move further to the

224
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,800
right that's where we're uh in danger of

225
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,520
but

226
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,800
and that's there's a lot of talk about

227
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,280
like i said because of the asap missiles

228
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,560
that have been launched here in the last

229
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,080
few years

230
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,599
but as i was like i said as i was doing

231
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,520
research on this presentation ran across

232
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,520
this was very interesting i had no idea

233
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,919
that actually the machine guns

234
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,360
had been

235
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,479
large

236
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,319
cannons had been actually deployed up

237
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,360
into space

238
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,280
back in the 70s the soviet union they

239
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,280
had one of the first space stations the

240
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,960
alma space station

241
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,440
it actually had a cannon

242
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,919
the 23-millimeter cannon that was uh

243
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,840
placed on that space station

244
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,319
and uh i found that fascinating so

245
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,879
i'd read about the uh missile waysides

246
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,639
but i didn't have no idea about

247
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,360
cannons and uh things being put on

248
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,680
satellite spacecraft and there was also

249
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,320
uh so that was in the 70s but also read

250
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,240
here then most recently

251
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,799
that the french are actually looking at

252
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,120
the on their on an upgraded syracuse

253
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,640
satellite it's going to be a new

254
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,080
satellite that's going to be put out

255
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,080
that they either they might have lasers

256
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,720
and or submachine guns on the satellite

257
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,240
for kinetic protection of the spacecraft

258
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,760
to protect the spacecraft from other

259
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,920
spacecraft attacking it so it's very

260
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,920
interesting i thought i would share that

261
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,600
about what's going on in space from a

262
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,040
kinetic standpoint now we'll get back

263
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,440
focused on the cyber security so when we

264
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,360
come from the cyber security standpoint

265
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,480
electronic warfare and cyber security

266
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,080
are kind of converging together it used

267
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,440
to be the electronic warfare was its own

268
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,360
specific domain but now it's kind of

269
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,640
converging and you get an electronic

270
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,160
warfare you get into the whole

271
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,399
jamming and spoofing you hear a lot

272
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,720
about the jamming and spoofing with the

273
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,760
attacks on shipping and planes with gps

274
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,560
where ships are showing showing up one

275
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,839
place

276
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,200
on their electronics but they're

277
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,040
actually in a different location so

278
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,120
there's a lot of that happening

279
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,160
and we're going to get in we're going to

280
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,920
talk about some examples of malware in

281
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,360
space

282
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,720
and

283
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,839
the ttc how the spacecraft and the

284
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,519
payload are

285
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,680
are controlled and flown

286
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,760
how the payload is managed and we'll

287
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,800
talk about

288
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,480
some vulnerabilities around replay and

289
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,040
hijacking

290
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,880
and eavesdropping

291
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,360
that the satellites are vulnerable to

292
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,480
now a few years ago it was a researcher

293
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,080
presented on this this was really

294
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,360
fascinating to me

295
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,240
that

296
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,920
everybody was talking about stuxnet but

297
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
a lot of people did not are not aware

298
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,600
that apparently

299
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,120
according to this one researcher he's

300
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,880
determined

301
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,000
that

302
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,640
stuxnet was able to find its way into

303
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,920
the ground station of a cable tv network

304
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,480
in india and from that ground station

305
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,519
network it was able to

306
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,640
go and infect the satellite the inside

307
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,800
4b satellite that was in space because

308
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,519
apparently they were running the wind cc

309
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,440
application and we're using the same

310
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,000
siemens plc that stuxnet targeted up on

311
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,839
the satellite and what what is uh

312
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,480
what the researchers believe is that the

313
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,399
satellite couldn't rotate its solar

314
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,760
panels

315
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,600
and it ended up disabling that satellite

316
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,040
and taking that cable tv satellite out

317
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,199
now

318
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,600
i mentioned earlier about uh space

319
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,519
weather

320
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,680
uh

321
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,680
until i started working on my fourth

322
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,399
masters in space i had no idea but there

323
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,399
was such thing as space wear there but

324
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,640
but there is space weather

325
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,519
i just learned a few semesters ago and

326
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,519
uh and basically what's happening is the

327
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,399
sun is releasing all these solar rays

328
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,160
and you're hearing probably read about

329
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,680
the solar storms that a lot of people

330
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,200
are concerned about affecting the power

331
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,040
grid but what's happening is there's all

332
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,640
these protons

333
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640
and ions that are being

334
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,160
sent into space

335
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,800
from uh the sun

336
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,120
and how that is measured is by

337
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,000
einstein's equation e equal m c squared

338
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,200
and that were

339
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,279
the m is the mass

340
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,079
of these protons and ions and then the c

341
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,240
is the speed of light squared and so

342
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,920
that's what the einstein equation is and

343
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,079
so i refer to what what i'm about to get

344
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,320
into is i refer to it as the einstein

345
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,360
denial of service because

346
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,480
these ions specifically those heavy ions

347
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,200
they

348
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,399
are

349
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,640
they can be real angry to electronics

350
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,920
and cause negative effects

351
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,720
and

352
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,000
also i'm also read recently where some

353
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,959
of the

354
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,639
solar activities coming from sun have

355
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,600
actually affected train the train

356
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,959
infrastructure up here in northern

357
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,680
europe where it's made

358
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,600
the trains look the train tracks look

359
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,839
busy when they really wasn't busy things

360
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,279
like that and it's also you know like i

361
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,880
said they're worried about uh

362
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,639
effects on possibly on the power grid

363
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,320
now

364
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,000
one one of the

365
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,560
the thoughts that i had when i started

366
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,240
looking at space

367
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,000
was i assumed that everything was

368
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,240
encrypted

369
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,440
it's not

370
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,560
uh

371
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,800
and the reason it's not being encrypted

372
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,040
is because these ions

373
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,959
that the sun is sending out all these

374
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,200
solar these solar storms and things and

375
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,839
what happens is when the sun is sending

376
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,360
all these ion particles through space

377
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,519
and it hits these electronics in

378
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,880
the satellites

379
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,480
or say uh space station it'll you know

380
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,560
all y'all everyone here understands

381
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,360
binary but think about it it flips bits

382
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,040
those ions can flip bits on your

383
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,519
electronics and then if you're doing if

384
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,200
you're doing encryption

385
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,600
and you have a two-way encryption going

386
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,200
and you've had to exchange your

387
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,959
encryption keys if you start getting

388
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,320
bits flipped what's going to happen you

389
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,079
got to start resyncing you got to get

390
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,720
your your connections rebuilt and if you

391
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,000
and uh if

392
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,200
you're going through

393
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,880
a heavy

394
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,800
solar storm say you know the space

395
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,720
weather is getting uh

396
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,279
really rough up during a period

397
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,279
for a period uh maybe we lose control of

398
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,720
the satellite because we can't get our

399
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
encryption sync back up so there's a lot

400
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,880
of the space vendors that don't want to

401
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,680
implement encryption on those control

402
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,279
channels of their satellites because

403
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,720
they don't want to be lose the ability

404
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,240
to fly their bird

405
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,000
makes sense

406
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,120
now to

407
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,040
but there is a solution to that then the

408
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,079
solution is to do radiation hardening to

409
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,320
the spacecraft and all the components to

410
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,959
protect it from the ions and but that

411
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,000
drives up the cost

412
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,199
so that's the reason that there's not

413
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,519
encryption it's heavily recommended

414
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,959
everyone talks about it everyone

415
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,680
recommends it but

416
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,240
unless it's a very sensitive

417
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,320
network satellite network operation most

418
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,839
likely it's not being encrypted

419
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,360
so here's some examples

420
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,560
of where

421
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,800
thing where uh the vulnerability was

422
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,720
exposed due to a lack of encryption

423
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,160
there was a uh

424
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,720
a a navy satellite

425
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,199
that some hackers in brazil discovered

426
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,360
and uh apparently uh

427
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,760
they you know but maybe not they weren't

428
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,920
hackers but they were uh

429
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,639
cb radio enthusiasts knew how to do rf

430
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,560
communications and they discovered that

431
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,720
the satellite was open and they were

432
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,959
using uh the navy satellite for a long

433
00:14:58,959 --> 00:14:59,839
time

434
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,399
as for for their uh radio communications

435
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,160
or cb radio and by the time

436
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,440
they finally started arresting people

437
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,240
they got a 39 people across

438
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,800
six states in brazil arrested and by the

439
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,959
time they got everybody arrested

440
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,800
new people started using the the

441
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,240
satellite because it was open once it

442
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
gets up in space it's hard to go both

443
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,839
security on after the fact but

444
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,600
that's going to get that is changing

445
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,279
though because there's this concept

446
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,760
called software-defined satellites just

447
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,800
like we have

448
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,480
software-defined networks here on the

449
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,560
ground we're getting certain the new

450
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,959
evolution is software-defined satellites

451
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,399
software-defined radio et cetera where

452
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,920
we can change the configurations of the

453
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,440
satellite so

454
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,040
so that'll that kind of limit

455
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,320
architecture limitation is going to be

456
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,639
changing in the future

457
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,800
but so here's another example i spoke

458
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,199
with some of some

459
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,040
others here tonight about this example

460
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,519
of uh that proves that satellite

461
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,000
encryption like for internet is

462
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,639
unencrypted

463
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,000
is there is a piece of malware if you're

464
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,079
not familiar with it called turla that

465
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,040
is speculated to have come out of russia

466
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,680
uh one of the malware gangs

467
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,959
out of russia apparently come up with

468
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,560
this piece of malware and it's very

469
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,240
innovative we got to admire their

470
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,680
creativity

471
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,160
and and the thought that went into this

472
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,079
and basically what happened with terla

473
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,199
some some end user would get infected

474
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,880
and the end user

475
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,800
would communicate back

476
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,720
to ip addresses

477
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,240
that were located

478
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,720
on a satellite network they were

479
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,519
basically satellite end users

480
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,360
internet subscribers

481
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,440
and those internet and so they would go

482
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,959
and

483
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,079
steal an ip address in the footprint

484
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,320
of the satellite broadcast and typically

485
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,480
it was in southern europe north north

486
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,360
africa where they were located and so

487
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,639
that end user would get infected

488
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,000
send a message to the c2 server

489
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,079
and and that ip address for the c2

490
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,400
server would be located in a satellite

491
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,799
internet user broadcast footprint

492
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,240
somewhere on the earth like i said

493
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,319
typically north africa southern europe

494
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,599
and then

495
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,319
and then when the server responded to

496
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,880
the infected system it would send its

497
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,760
response over a fixed land line so the

498
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,079
communication looks async one part of

499
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,439
the communication would come over

500
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,240
satellite broadcast and the return would

501
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,720
go over fixed line so it would be really

502
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,480
hard if you're a threat hunter if you

503
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,720
don't have visibility on both networks

504
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,640
to be able to troubleshoot this and this

505
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,480
is only possible because

506
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,840
the connections are unencrypted

507
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,600
so another example of a problem with

508
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,880
satellite

509
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,200
is there is a u.s german satellite

510
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,440
called the rosat

511
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,120
there was

512
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,120
that was taken control of it is

513
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,960
speculated that a

514
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,280
ground station was hacked and from that

515
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,120
ground station the satellite was able to

516
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,320
be controlled and uh and

517
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,960
it was even it was turned and rotated so

518
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,200
back toward the sun so it ended up being

519
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,160
disabled because it was pointed the way

520
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,080
it was pointed back at the sun

521
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,919
ended up disabling that satellite and it

522
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,919
ended up

523
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,440
being removed from service uh

524
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,600
another example of uh issue with

525
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,919
satellite real world here is there was a

526
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,480
satellite called landsat 7.

527
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,120
it had 12 minutes of interference so

528
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,799
they were able to recover

529
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,400
control of the satellite but it was

530
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,280
taken control of for a period both in

531
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,799
2007

532
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,520
and in 2008.

533
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,000
now if that was a strong encryption

534
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,520
controlling that link

535
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,280
the only way to have gotten access to

536
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,039
that satellite would have been to go

537
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,960
through the ground station so someone

538
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,120
was able to go and throw up their own

539
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,280
ground station and communicate with that

540
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,600
satellite and influence that satellite

541
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,879
because it was unencrypted

542
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,360
then there's the terror satellite

543
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,200
it went through uh two minutes of

544
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,039
interference and 08 and then nine

545
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:07,919
minutes

546
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,080
of interference in october of oa

547
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,120
so again

548
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,280
an unencrypted satellite communications

549
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,039
enabled this because on the way to do

550
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,320
this is either

551
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,240
go in through the ground station that

552
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,480
controls the site or be able to bring up

553
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,720
your own a lot and if it's unencrypted

554
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,400
then you you know

555
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
it's like we do here on the ground

556
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,440
uh

557
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,880
targeted and

558
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,400
figure out how to get your own access

559
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,640
but they were able to

560
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,559
get back control of the bird

561
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,520
now

562
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,679
there's a

563
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,600
another satellite in the u.s

564
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,640
noaa

565
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,720
noaa monitors the oceans and the

566
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,679
atmosphere in the u.s they monitor

567
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,840
weather and apparently they had there

568
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,039
was a weather satellite that they

569
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,600
managed that in 2014 got hacked by the

570
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,320
chinese for a period they they were able

571
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,480
to recover control of it

572
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,440
but it was hacked

573
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,120
there's a lot of speculation over this

574
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,960
one in the uk

575
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,520
there's a network called the sky net

576
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,840
and it's a small constellation like i

577
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,480
believe it's like four satellites

578
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,919
that are in this constellation called

579
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,280
skynet back in 99

580
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,600
there's a lot of uh

581
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,679
articles published that say that it was

582
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,919
taken control of and it was held ransom

583
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,520
then there's other

584
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,080
other other people other sources

585
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,240
that are saying that it wasn't hacked

586
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,799
but it but the control channel was

587
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,159
influenced

588
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,760
uh the channel the control channel

589
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,760
between the ground and the satellite was

590
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,000
intercepted and for me that's still a

591
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,159
hack right uh it might not have been

592
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,600
held for ransom but it would there was

593
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,520
still a hack may not have had total

594
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,840
control of the bird but but they were

595
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,480
able to influence and con

596
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,840
that satellite

597
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,840
it's just a lot of arguing back and

598
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
forth on what really happened

599
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,679
on that but there was some some kind of

600
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,039
event that happened to that scotland

601
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,000
satellite now from a marijuana malware

602
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,600
standpoint

603
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,760
on the space station

604
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,280
that i'm uh but that i've been able to

605
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,039
find there was two events

606
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,799
where malware was introduced to space

607
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,559
station

608
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,960
one's from a thumb drive go figure thumb

609
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,400
drives in space

610
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,919
uh

611
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,760
you know we have problems with our users

612
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,760
on space apparently uh astronauts use

613
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,879
thumb drives as well

614
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,000
uh so and then another

615
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
infection was caused by a laptop that

616
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,480
got introduced into space

617
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,880
now it's not just a wild wild west out

618
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,360
there there are standards

619
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,880
international standards there's

620
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,799
organization the consultative committee

621
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,919
for space data systems

622
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,280
it's kind of like think of like itu ieee

623
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,280
where international bodies

624
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,080
they're right the requirements and best

625
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,400
practices for how space systems should

626
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,640
operate the protocols

627
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,720
however how everything should be

628
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,799
designed and built well they also go and

629
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,960
publish a great deal of documentation on

630
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,039
recommendations for how to secure these

631
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,440
spacecraft the protocols the systems

632
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,400
themselves so there are standards but

633
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,480
you just like everything else

634
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,320
you have to you have to go and implement

635
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,440
it and design it in in early and i try

636
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,280
to bolt it on later

637
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,960
and that's the problem we have is a lot

638
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,960
of these systems have been been in orbit

639
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,400
for many many years

640
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,000
it's hard you can't go changing now that

641
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,520
it's up in orbit but we can go and try

642
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,039
to implement better design up front

643
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,559
now if you're interested in space or if

644
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,039
you work for an organization that is uh

645
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,480
leaning toward getting involved with

646
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,640
space this right here might be this

647
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,480
slide might have some really good

648
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,919
references for you

649
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,120
uh

650
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,480
it's from all

651
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,720
everyone that i can find that has best

652
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,880
practices documented for how to go and

653
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,520
secure space systems uh in the at the

654
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,799
very bottom

655
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,159
germany recently released best practices

656
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,960
i i suspect that uh the european space

657
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,039
agency will be putting out some

658
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,520
references of their own uh but there's a

659
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,480
whole lot of references from

660
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,760
universities and government

661
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,679
organizations in the u.s like i said

662
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,280
germany et cetera

663
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,799
and i don't expect you to read this

664
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,240
slide i want you to know it's here if

665
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,000
you if you need this information if you

666
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
will reach out to me on linkedin i'll

667
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,320
send you a google drive link with with

668
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,840
all the slides all the information so

669
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,080
you can dig into this and

670
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,679
save you some time and research finding

671
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,760
it all

672
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
i was talking earlier about all the

673
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,480
different operating systems and

674
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,080
command languages and protocols et

675
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,760
cetera i thought i would throw this out

676
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,120
here for everyone's benefit

677
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,120
there's like 20

678
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,559
operating systems and actually i

679
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,240
discovered i've discovered another and

680
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,880
there's 21 that i've identified so far

681
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,200
of operating systems used in space most

682
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,120
of the new stuff is is a linux

683
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,559
derivative

684
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,000
uh so

685
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,520
so everything seems to be converging

686
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
toward linux

687
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,120
the new one i discovered here recently

688
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,120
was one that uh china uses for their

689
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,520
space systems called salex that's why

690
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,039
lix

691
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,200
it apparently is open source out on

692
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,159
github

693
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,280
and

694
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,960
in space chain

695
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,760
which is which is a blockchain

696
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,760
space operating system application

697
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,559
it's based on silex as well

698
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,919
and then there's like numerous of those

699
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,600
because there's like

700
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,120
20 other operating systems here

701
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,000
for you to check out

702
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,960
from a command language is of how you

703
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,159
communicate with satellite

704
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,640
in the research i have there may be more

705
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,000
i don't know how many of these are

706
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,520
currently in use

707
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,279
still today and what's being deployed

708
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,000
but

709
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,440
what i've been i was able to find in

710
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,760
research were 37 different command

711
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,279
languages and that's what one of my

712
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,159
thoughts were like some of the

713
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,679
satellites that i

714
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,559
threw up that that someone accessed it

715
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,480
and then they got kicked off pretty

716
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,039
quickly my thought is my thought on that

717
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,480
is is probably because of these comp

718
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,279
these command languages it's like uh

719
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,200
it's like someone that's a

720
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,440
a windows expert

721
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,360
they might can control the world with

722
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,039
power shell

723
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,120
but you go and get on uh if but that

724
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,440
same hacker that's a world-class expert

725
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,480
on windows they go get on an old vms vax

726
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,960
box they ain't gonna know where vms is

727
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,080
you know they're gonna be too young for

728
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,640
that you know or maybe an old uh an old

729
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
unix box maybe it's a

730
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,960
you know sgi maybe it's an sgi

731
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,480
derivative

732
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,159
you know or an old solaris box they you

733
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,279
know that that

734
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,960
windows person is not going to know

735
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,000
those old operating systems and

736
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,159
it'll be easier for someone to detect

737
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,600
and have time to get them kicked off

738
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,279
their system that's my thought process

739
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,720
and what might have happened

740
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,679
uh

741
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,039
without when i started figuring out

742
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,240
there's

743
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,840
that i've identified 37 commanding

744
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,279
languages

745
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,039
and from a protocol standpoint i've

746
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,720
identified right now

747
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,919
around 20 space network protocols uh

748
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,600
most of the cube sites that are up there

749
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,240
they use that cubesat protocol and the

750
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,760
ccs ds space communication protocol and

751
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,760
in europe

752
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,720
there's a european cooperation first

753
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,640
space standardization packet utilization

754
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,159
standard ecss pus which is the european

755
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,559
standard that a lot of organizations use

756
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,799
but then of course then there's there's

757
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,760
obviously ipv4 and ipv6 is being used

758
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,400
for like web one

759
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,679
spacex

760
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,080
the starlink constellation are all using

761
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,480
ip

762
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,120
there's quite a number of protocols out

763
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,240
there

764
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,159
so if you were to start going looking at

765
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,039
trying to build a threat hunt capability

766
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,400
one reason i put those slides there

767
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,840
showing all the operating system command

768
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,440
languages to give you an idea if we

769
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,799
start wanting to go and start doing

770
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,799
space thread hunting

771
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,640
there's a there's a whole lot of

772
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,640
operating systems and protocols and

773
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,159
command languages that we're going to

774
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,480
have to get tooled up for depending on

775
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,159
what our domain of responsibility is

776
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,960
if we want to start thread hunting

777
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,000
now

778
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,919
there is some encouraging improvements

779
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,559
going on with space here uh

780
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,320
this year

781
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,440
the slingshot satellite uh was put into

782
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,279
space and it's using that

783
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,720
software-defined

784
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,480
satellite technology i mentioned which

785
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,760
is basically

786
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,600
in the satellite is able to run virtual

787
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,360
machines and containers

788
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,039
just like what we run here on the gr on

789
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,799
the ground like you know docker

790
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,159
containers

791
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,440
so that gives you a whole lot of

792
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,520
flexibility with being able to change

793
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,080
vms add new applications if you just

794
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,559
discover there might be a a security

795
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,559
breach maybe you could go and pull back

796
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,080
a a gold version of that that container

797
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,480
and put it back in the operation and

798
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,960
take the suspect container out of

799
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,600
operation uh

800
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,120
intrusion prevention you know

801
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,720
everybody's got intrusion preventions on

802
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,960
their firewalls here on the ground well

803
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,640
this satellite is probably the first one

804
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,559
that i'm aware of out in the public

805
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,240
research that i've done that is

806
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,000
implementing intrusion production

807
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,679
intrusion prevention capabilities so i

808
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,960
thought that was pretty cool uh see

809
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,200
and they're also doing you know logging

810
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,960
and monitoring everything and they're

811
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,640
monitoring for commands

812
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,320
looking for commands to come in out of

813
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,799
order commands to come you know out you

814
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,880
know the wrong sequence the wrong timing

815
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,480
apply machine learning to that to look

816
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,399
for those anomalies in the commands that

817
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,080
are being seen so that they can detect

818
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,360
someone's trying to help them manage

819
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,440
their satellite so that

820
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,760
there's that's a great deal of progress

821
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,880
and like i said you know it's using

822
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,960
software to find capabilities

823
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,960
so that they can up they can upgrade the

824
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,890
satellite and change the configuration

825
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,039
[Music]

826
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,799
and also

827
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,279
the european space agency

828
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,200
and some other entities are working on

829
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,279
this satellite that they've deployed and

830
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,799
it also has some software-defined

831
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,080
capabilities it was put up in

832
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,399
july of 21

833
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,399
and one of the things i saw about it is

834
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,320
is it has a software defined radio

835
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,159
capability so if someone starts

836
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,000
interfering with the connection starts

837
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,440
jamming

838
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,520
that they can dynamically reconfigure

839
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,399
the satellite to

840
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,240
to protect itself against you know if

841
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,840
someone is intentionally or

842
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,840
unintentionally interfering with its

843
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,159
communications

844
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,840
so there's there's improvements

845
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,760
happening with some some good research

846
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,520
is happening and there's new

847
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,360
new satellites being put up there that

848
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,640
have cyber security focus on them

849
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,000
now

850
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,279
if you're interested in learning more

851
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,200
about space systems and satellite

852
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,360
communications uh want to do your own

853
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,279
research either you know just for your

854
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,760
personal benefit or for university or

855
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,080
your job this is your this is a good

856
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,559
slide for you to uh to help get you

857
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,720
started everything on here is open

858
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,000
source that openstack kit is from nasa

859
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,279
in the u.s

860
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,320
the cfs is a a cubesat

861
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,200
satellite operating system that flies on

862
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,919
a lot of satellites today

863
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,799
cosmos is a ground station from ball

864
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,480
aerospace and 42 is an orbit simulator

865
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,720
so that you can model and simulate

866
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,919
the uh

867
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,919
the orbit of the satellites and that's

868
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,520
all free and you can download it all as

869
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,279
a kit in the openside kit or you can

870
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,919
download it individually uh also there's

871
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:20,960
a

872
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,480
nos3 the nasa operational simulator for

873
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,640
small satellites that is another

874
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,559
satellite operating system

875
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,279
that you can fire up in containers vms

876
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,880
and operate in your personal network

877
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,279
and space chain os i mentioned earlier

878
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,799
space chain os is a blockchain uh

879
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,880
system that was developed by a company

880
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,279
in china of space chain os uh and it's

881
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,240
based on that salex os

882
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,039
both

883
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,240
it's also the the sylex os is

884
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,880
is uh used on my understanding is used

885
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,440
on the uh satellite systems from china

886
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,880
so in

887
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,399
what i could tell both of them are

888
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,559
available out on github

889
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,039
if you would like to try utilizing those

890
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,720
operating systems then there is the

891
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,240
artemis project

892
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,360
uh satnags those are interesting uh open

893
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,399
source satellite projects and uh

894
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,159
it is a

895
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,840
really interesting tool that came

896
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,200
available here recently is this tool

897
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,120
called icarus

898
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,080
that if you're interested in modeling

899
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,919
modeling and simulating these large

900
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,919
internet space constellations like web

901
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:28,799
one

902
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,440
and spacex learning more about how those

903
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,360
work and how uh

904
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,679
their vulnerabilities to like uh

905
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,919
denial of service attacks go check out

906
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,360
icarus it's free to download the

907
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,600
researchers publish that and it's free

908
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,399
and it's a very interesting tool

909
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,840
that you need to be aware of

910
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,600
so

911
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,679
that's what i had to

912
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,679
share with you share with you um i

913
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,760
believe i went over

914
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,440
but

915
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,799
anybody have any questions

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,720
any questions well if you're if you're

917
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,559
interested in the slides

918
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,799
or if you're interested you know any of

919
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,640
the old older presentations i've done on

920
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,000
network telecommunications if you hit me

921
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,080
on linkedin i'll send i'll send you a

922

link and you can download everything

923
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,080
uh including the space stuff if you're

924
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,120
interested

925
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,320
thank you thank you very much
