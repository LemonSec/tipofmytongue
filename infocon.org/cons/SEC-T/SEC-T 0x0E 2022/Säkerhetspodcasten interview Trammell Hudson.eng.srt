1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,180
all right welcome to uh the first

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,300
interview uh of uh the the first day of

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,760
uh secti uh we did some interviews

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,740
yesterday uh at the community at the

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,360
community night but but this is the

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,340
first real one and we have trouble here

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,160
and we just came off the stage uh

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,100
opening up SEC T

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,779
2022. in a true hacker manner yes

10
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,080
tinkering yeah and hopefully uh you know

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,240
hopefully a fun talk to you folks uh uh

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,980
thinking about uh security and reverse

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,880
engineering yeah not there's no uh uh no

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,620
world change in zero days got dropped

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,500
this was just a a fun uh thing something

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,820
to do with your home appliances and

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,320
classic Voyage board

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,660
yes yes exactly

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,719
um uh apparently uh there might have

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,020
been people from uh from the uh yeah the

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,940
vendors in the audience so that's pretty

22
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,680
fun I'm hoping to meet up with them and

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,719
Shout out later yeah cool

24
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,360
so you were you were sort of reaching

25
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,100
out a ham and saying you know I'd like

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,319
to see this you know become part of the

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,080
their their official offering and I I

28
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,240
think that's uh that's really cool I

29
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,619
think you know a lot of a lot of

30
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,820
companies would probably benefit from

31
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,740
making this available

32
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,460
and it's also something where uh the the

33
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,619
the people who are building uh Smart

34
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,020
Homes and doing home automation are

35
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,960
frankly nerds yes yeah and they're going

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,880
to be the early adopters who are who

37
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,340
will want to who would be interested in

38
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,400
hey there is a local uh rest API that I

39
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,799
can use to talk to my Appliance that's

40
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,900
actually a selling point for a small

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,000
percentage of the population yes but yes

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,119
I think yeah no but like a I don't know

43
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,040
like in Sweden nowadays the electric

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,840
bill is really really expensive so home

45
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,000
automation and monitoring of appliances

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,040
such as this is actually a thing now

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,360
like it's on the right like home

48
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,100
assistant like the open source home

49
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,780
assistant project has so many new

50
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,820
adopters you can see how many that

51
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,159
clones the Red Bulls and ESP home or

52
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,960
test mode that is like this open source

53
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,420
firmware those are a huge stream there

54
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,699
so I totally agree that that should be a

55
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,380
thing where you're able to sort of

56
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,780
integrate with a rest API or be able to

57
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,879
put an open source firmware on there in

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,400
order to serve your purpose right right

59
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,140
and the

60
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,140
um uh the the energy prices are also

61
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,360
really a driver for things like the uh

62
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,459
the power aware scheduling sure to say

63
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:29,220
let's not start the dishwasher Intel

64
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,800
power is cheap or available let's not

65
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,620
run the dishwasher while we're also

66
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,660
running the dryer these are things that

67
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,959
are fairly easy to do uh in in a home

68
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,300
automation system but are very

69
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,280
challenging to do in the vendor provided

70
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,599
apps especially if you have a dishwasher

71
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,900
from one vendor and a laundry from

72
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,239
another and the heater or the the what

73
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:54,840
the

74
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,599
water heater yeah or whatever you want

75
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,720
to so that's pretty cool and I think the

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,060
the arrow that is just getting started

77
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,800
like to be self-sufficient and be your

78
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,340
own producer and like like benefiting of

79
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,379
these spot prices when it's cheap you do

80
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,959
the laundry it's pretty cool so it's

81
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,420
actually you're you're you're in perfect

82
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,879
timing I guess for this I I think

83
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,280
there's a lot of interest yeah and you

84
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,739
know the uh the other thing that I think

85
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,560
is is really uh underrepresented in a

86
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,900
lot of the um home automation is the

87
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,000
accessibility aspect yeah the fact that

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,860
uh not everyone can can see a um a touch

89
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,019
screen and interact with it but all of

90
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,840
these devices are now coming with um you

91
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,280
know with capsense buttons everywhere

92
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,799
that you have to that sometimes change

93
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,040
their function yeah so being able to

94
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,340
build uh customized devices that then

95
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,920
interact with a wide variety of systems

96
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,599
I think that's very useful yeah I

97
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,580
thought that was a really nice nice take

98
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,040
on on the reasoning why you wouldn't

99
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,900
want to do something like this

100
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,200
because the the accessibility

101
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,080
it will I mean limit some people from

102
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,540
buying an appliance because they might

103
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,519
have a you know problem with their

104
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,680
eyesight or or something like that and

105
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,680
being able to to build a sort of a

106
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,139
control panel for them uh that's that's

107
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,660
pretty that's a cool aspect as well no

108
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,759
but I I'm guilty of that like when I

109
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,240
pick out a new Appliance in my home I

110
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,220
try to see if there is a rest API it

111
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,900
doesn't have to be on the actual Cloud

112
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,139
devices but can I Shane it so I can make

113
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,240
have like for example home assistant do

114
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,460
the queries yes and sort of run the app

115
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,280
but in a different context so that is

116
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,020
one way of going but this is this is I

117
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,000
think is should be an opt-in or out

118
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,520
thing do you want to do you want to

119
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,500
integrate to your own

120
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,139
um sort of thing great that will be an

121
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,300
awesome feature to have because

122
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,979
like

123
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,740
in aspects of security and breaking the

124
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,240
device that should not be the case

125
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,040
because you should be binary on which

126
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,080
functions you're able to sort of run you

127
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,800
can't put the centrifuge more than the X

128
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,620
amount of blah blah blah yes yes

129
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,759
apparently like you know what I'm going

130
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,320
like yeah it could be like you can build

131
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,759
your own integration using the

132
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,740
functionality as it's intended of course

133
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,360
you can break stuff then I think that

134
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,340
would be a cool way of doing it because

135
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,460
no one does that right and something you

136
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,500
mentioned earlier about you want to be

137
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,759
able to install your own firmware on

138
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,680
devices so things like tesmoto make that

139
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,660
possible with some sorts of things and

140
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,600
you know with uh with devices that have

141
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,500
large Motors or you know uh um uh

142
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,020
kilowatt sort of capabilities sometimes

143
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,720
we we might say well maybe we don't want

144
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,699
to install our own firmware there quite

145
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:45,900
yet yeah

146
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,000
um like yeah because things can actually

147
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
happen like reverse polarity and like

148
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,680
the models start to spin in the wrong

149
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,620
direction or yeah yeah it's shifting and

150
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,740
that could be exactly so they're like so

151
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,979
I I really like uh the ability to put my

152
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,539
own firmware on devices

153
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,940
um you know so many of my projects are

154
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,860
about that yeah right yeah the the

155
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,780
micropython for Ikea light bulbs

156
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,000
completely replaces the Ikea firmware

157
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,919
yeah 100 of it

158
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,880
um but the worst uh you can do is make

159
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,800
the light turn on and off that it's

160
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,340
there's really no yeah it's not getting

161
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,039
um uh three kilowatts of power coming

162
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:27,419
through there

163
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,039
um a heater on the other hand could

164
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,740
potentially yes exactly that

165
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,199
um and then in other cases like on the

166
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,060
uh the Magic Lantern firmware for the

167
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,120
Canon cameras there I didn't want to

168
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,280
replace the Canon firmware because it

169
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,400
did 95 of what I needed I just wanted to

170
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,319
make some small tweaks to make them

171
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,419
slightly more suited for what I needed

172
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,819
is that how it worked so it's sort of a

173
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,460
side card thing yes okay so you run it

174
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,900
on a memory card and then you have the

175
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,259
native ah yes okay so it was a

176
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,240
replacement but it isn't it it doesn't

177
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,520
replace sound okay so it um uh so it

178
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,060
actually uh the can the camera will boot

179
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,120
uh off the memory card yeah um and then

180
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,900
the Magic Lantern firmware uh hooks uh

181
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,699
uh some functions in the real firmware

182
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,860
and then jumps into into the real

183
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,080
firmware and then when when the firmware

184
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,580
reaches that stage during its

185
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,880
initialization this extra user code gets

186
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,220
called that then can create threads it

187
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,259
can create GUI elements it can interact

188
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:29,940
with the buttons and the hardware but

189
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,120
all of the uh the the OEM firmware is

190
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,120
still there in ROM unchanged that's

191
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,880
pretty cool that's cool yeah because

192
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,759
yeah they've done really good work on a

193
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,220
lot of it and now I know Peter I ran it

194
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,780
a couple of years ago that he's not in

195
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,819
screen but yeah the the more uh beard

196
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:52,319
videographer yeah yeah he has all the

197
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,220
stuff

198
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,620
yeah here he is now now there he is

199
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,259
yeah

200
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:01,440
um so you know I think there's there's a

201
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,300
um there's a whole spectrum of you know

202
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,860
completely open source firmware on the

203
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,580
device to uh running

204
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,620
um you know alongside the closed

205
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,319
firmware to totally close

206
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,039
now frankly I would love if uh if if

207
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,620
things like the menuing system on the

208
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,099
dishwasher and whatnot were um uh

209
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,020
perhaps fixable

210
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,580
um you know there's not so much in the

211
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,379
dishwasher but the uh the oven has some

212
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,060
frustrations where I would really like

213
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,880
to be able to add my own

214
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,399
menu elements yeah and right now I don't

215
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,500
have code execution on the device my

216
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,000
talk is purely about the communication

217
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,320
protocol but you know maybe uh do you

218
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,620
have foreign

219
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,260
so Siemens has uh they have a hack so

220
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,420
you're like a thing in Sweden is now

221
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,420
everyone is into pizza and you need

222
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,459
you've got to do a nice Pizza you need

223
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:08,700
to have a stone or a cast iron plate in

224
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,800
your oven yes but you want as high

225
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,860
temperature as possible and these uh new

226
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,399
fairly new ovens have uh what is it

227
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,260
called like the English word I don't

228
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,720
know but it's sort of Peter Liz where

229
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,779
you sort of it's super hot as a cleaning

230
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,779
functions

231
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,339
had it's a higher setting that you're

232
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,140
able to put on when you're going to make

233
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,760
your pizza right right but then some

234
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,880
smart person out there figured out how

235
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,580
you can enable the since the function of

236
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,380
burning everything off in the in the

237
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,480
oven is there how you can hack it so you

238
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,060
can get it a lot warmer which is perfect

239
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,860
for the pizza mode so that is actually a

240
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,720
hack out there there is a combination

241
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,940
that you have to do oh so you've got to

242
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,620
do up up down left right jump start

243
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,519
exactly like exactly that but so it's a

244
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,640
sheet code on your Siemens oven and it

245
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,200
actually works it's pretty cool but it

246
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,940
that's that's likely the same idea you

247
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,860
like this like body warranty but it is a

248
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,519
cool

249
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,680
to function someone is I need to have

250
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,600
this and they spend time figuring it out

251
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,000
but I think I think it's it's like you

252
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,040
know there's this this movement towards

253
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,740
you want to own your devices you want to

254
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,080
be in control you don't want your device

255
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,300
to be controlled by the cloud for

256
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,760
instance yeah and uh no but I think like

257
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,040
when privacy concepts are getting more

258
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,779
out there people know how data

259
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,240
harvesting or user data is actually

260
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,019
collected and sold yeah I think uh this

261
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,720
will be a tournament where but I guess

262
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,240
like we as sort of nerds or Geeks in

263
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,160
this field we already see that in home

264
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,980
automation uh when home automation is

265
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,959
not proprietary anymore we have the open

266
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,660
source stuff and we see like there is a

267
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,300
lot of adopters there so I think this

268
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,980
will sort of I think this is a natural

269
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,579
path I think

270
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,339
right right and the the other aspect of

271
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,200
um of this sort of openness is it's

272
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,600
easier to repair yeah and it's easier to

273
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,019
keep things going and yeah yeah as we

274
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,839
look at um sort of this desire to keep

275
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,779
uh appliances running longer to be able

276
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,000
to reduce the amount of E-Waste that

277
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,800
we're putting into the system

278
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,200
um that's actually a valid uh valid

279
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,399
point as well I didn't even think about

280
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,920
it E-Waste is actually probably a really

281
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,420
sound thing for the environment it's

282
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,820
just a screen that died so yeah good

283
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,420
yeah I've been checking both yeah so

284
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,180
being able to um uh to adapt them to

285
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,820
different needs or to uh you know

286
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,200
prolong their use

287
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,620
um you know and not big appliances it's

288
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,420
maybe less of an issue most people keep

289
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,040
their their dishwashers in their ovens

290
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,180
for many years

291
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,399
um uh the the one that we bought again

292
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,860
because it has the auto Open Door uh

293
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,720
replacement that had been in our house

294
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,839
for 15 years so that's that's a pretty

295
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,940
good longevity that's a good longevity

296
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,040
compared to it compared to a phone

297
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,899
um but a lot of our dashboards are built

298
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,760
out of around the house are built out of

299
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,240
old Kindles or old phones that uh

300
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,220
because we can install our own firmware

301
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,620
that then we can interface with our own

302
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,260
home automation suddenly they don't go

303
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,120
into the e-way stream that they they

304
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,180
find new life and this is uh I think a

305
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,640
really good reason for for being able to

306
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,720
build 100 I I did like the whole Rabbit

307
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,220
Hole thing with dashboards in my home

308
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,800
now so I have like this tablets and in

309
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,220
our fully where everything is more or

310
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,420
less integrated more like a display

311
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,160
thing but then you can sort of see if

312
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,899
the doors are open if the dishwasher is

313
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,180
running if the car is charging yeah yeah

314
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,459
and it it's so much more convenient than

315
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:48,899
pulling the phone out to be like and

316
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,399
strolling through six different apps yes

317
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,860
right yes yeah I think it's pretty cool

318
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,560
and yeah I said it yesterday as well you

319
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,019
get so I get so excited being at a

320
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:59,279
conference like this because there is a

321
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,320
lot of like-minded people it gives you

322
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,660
so much energy if you don't feel that as

323
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,279
lonely as you do no but yeah

324
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,019
talking with my wife about this she's

325
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:12,000
like I don't want to hear this but this

326
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,279
is like a nice input guys yeah it's

327
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,800
really fun yeah my partner uh is is

328
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,899
fully sold on the uh all of the the

329
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:19,980
automations

330
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,420
um that they they help write the the

331
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,579
Python scripts and to be to be fair like

332
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:25,380
she was so against it

333
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,600
not it will never work it will break all

334
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,279
the time I just want it to work but now

335
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,019
she's like she actually likes it and

336
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,180
it's but it's not that nothing is

337
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,100
dependent on it but it does

338
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,680
here to have yeah so it's pretty cool

339
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,959
like yeah the yeah

340
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:43,019
she learns to like it cool well drama

341
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:45,420
thank you so much for taking the time oh

342
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,620
question Peter yeah yeah like this line

343
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,660
here you were running animal

344
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,940
enumeration

345
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,500
[Music]

346
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,160
and what it says that the dishwasher

347
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,279
supported TLS null with neural with null

348
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,279
yes there was that question came up uh

349
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,920
during the Q a as well and I didn't

350
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,660
notice that until I put the slide

351
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,000
together and I never uh because that

352
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,440
that can't be good for

353
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,480
that it's rubbish so I'm going to go

354
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,820
back uh um actually I I could ssh in to

355
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,959
I could uh yeah do the uh set up the

356
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,820
wire guard tunnel get into our home

357
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,420
network and then yeah

358
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,660
because it's interesting like does it

359
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,240
even work yeah or if but it should work

360
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,620
but the Integrity of it should be

361
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,380
terrible yeah right right non-existent

362
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,240
but let's also consider what is the

363
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,519
threat model here yeah you know

364
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,519
um a man in the middle something

365
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,320
this is the same thing being offered

366
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,380
with that uh yeah okay so that is not

367
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,480
tested

368
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,560
um although I also want to point out

369
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,139
that uh different models of the

370
00:14:58,139 --> 00:14:59,459
appliances

371
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:03,300
um uh have HTTP interfaces instead of

372
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,100
https yeah

373
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,880
um but on the ones that are doing HTTP

374
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,300
they uh they are doing their own AES CBC

375
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,959
and hmac wrappers around all of the uh

376
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,519
the website

377
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,920
it's really good yeah yeah you say a day

378
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,139
yes yeah so it's not only CBC but yeah

379
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:25,079
decent German engineer it is you know we

380
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:26,000
can hope

381
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,459
we've seen a lot of times

382
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,680
it takes too much bite so let's just Pat

383
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,540
it with zeros because that's easier no

384
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,220
the the pattern algorithm looks good

385
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,380
yeah you know I'm uh they're doing

386
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,120
proper um

387
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,540
oh shoot I it's been a few months since

388
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,860
they they are doing yeah and uh overall

389
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,959
I I haven't actually seen any of the

390
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,519
code on the devices I haven't gotten

391
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,260
code execution on the appliances but all

392
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,839
of the stuff sort of around it makes me

393
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:57,360
feel that somebody who knew cryptography

394
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,399
at least looked at it and gave them some

395
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,500
advice we didn't ask this and I

396
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,660
the night but is it uh what kind of uh

397
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,820
of operating system is it have you

398
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,260
figured that one or is it a real-time

399
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,860
Roselle doesn't work oh uh is it oh I

400
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,820
should have I should have put a slide

401
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,459
about that um uh I don't know anything

402
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:23,880
about that but I do know uh

403
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,100
I think I think it's the their web

404
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,800
server is called nebula and I've been

405
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,019
meaning to do some searches to try to

406
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:32,820
see if that's like a an off-the-shelf

407
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,860
thing that they've bought or you know if

408
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,120
it's something maybe that they built

409
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,420
in-house I I don't know but that is the

410
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,399
um that one string is the only sort of

411
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,980
clue that I've seen as to what's inside

412
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,199
because Bush they do a lot of computers

413
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:48,300
like everyone that has sort of connected

414
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,579
into the car World know that they have

415
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:53,519
this amazing no not amazing amazingly

416
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,100
weird monolith structure with their

417
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,440
ecu's for example and that will be uh

418
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,060
would be like even if you get code

419
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,699
execution it will be terrible because it

420
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:04,740
will more or less be like a real-time OS

421
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,579
well my Canon camera stuff I I'm pretty

422
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,480
experienced yeah

423
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,419
like I would be like the the path of

424
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:16,679
reversing that and getting something

425
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,660
nice out of it is really hard if you

426
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,540
haven't looked at that yes yes they can

427
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,559
be

428
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,179
and especially because uh they're they

429
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,919
you can't look at the source code or

430
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:29,880
examples

431
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,559
um I I love pulling apart devices that

432
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:34,440
are running in Linux because uh I can

433
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,320
load that file system into uh into my

434
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,200
desktop machine I can poke at it and

435
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,640
typically Things are Written in a shell

436
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,039
scripts so it's something like oh my

437
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,140
channel is easy yeah

438
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,559
um yeah compared to yeah some uh rtos

439
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,320
that has to fit in 32 kilobytes of of uh

440
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,020
a flash that's a much more challenging

441
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,200
reverse engineering Target yeah and like

442
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,340
monolith structures where everything

443
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,320
just have their own sort of confined

444
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,200
space Enclave like here we do this and

445
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,059
then you can do telnet to this and here

446
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,740
we do that and blah blah it's really

447
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,900
hard to yeah yeah it is sort of

448
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,640
fascinating when you do get into the um

449
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,740
uh the static analysis with things like

450
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,120
ghidra

451
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,760
um you can almost start to identify

452
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,340
different groups inside the company that

453
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,140
wrote the different modules that there's

454
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,260
like style choices that that make it all

455
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,820
the way into the binary yeah that's

456
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,760
pretty cool um and so it's occasionally

457
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,620
uh I've seen things where I can

458
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,880
definitely say

459
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,940
this company bought a USB library from

460
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,760
someone they bought their fat file

461
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,919
system library from somebody else and

462
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,960
then they had two different teams you

463
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,480
know doing the GUI versus the threading

464
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,160
that's pretty cool so it's kind of cool

465
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,299
yeah

466
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:49,980
yeah but I guess that makes sense when

467
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,360
you looked at a lot of it like you see

468
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,980
like if you do like a graphical overview

469
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,960
or something and then you can sort of

470
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,419
see if how everything flows that would

471
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,039
be a lot different if you build file

472
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,320
systems a lot I guess they have a lot

473
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,660
more edge cases like if they're not sure

474
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,160
things and that would be sort of blocks

475
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,140
in your yes machine so that would be

476
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,419
visible that's pretty good that's pretty

477
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:11,160
cool yeah yeah and a lot of it shows up

478
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,840
like a lot of times they'll have like

479
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,280
different login libraries that they've

480
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,799
Linked In so you know the file systems

481
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,140
log in one way and the task management

482
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,600
logs in another way and so you can you

483
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,100
you get those sort of Clues that's

484
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,539
pretty cool yeah

485
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:28,080
okay yeah so let's let's wrap yeah um

486
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,299
thank you again for uh taking time to

487
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,120
talk to us and um enjoy the rest of the

488
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,640
conference yes it's wonderful to be uh

489
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,460
back in our Stockholm it's um after uh a

490
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,620
few years in the Netherlands um uh this

491
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,080
feels very three-dimensional yeah I

492
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,260
think I've climbed more Hills uh in in

493
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,700
