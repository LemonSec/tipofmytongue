1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,259
hi there we are uh almost live on the

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,620
SEC T stream here we with the the second

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,700
pair

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,980
um up today on uh sexy 2022 and uh

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,300
you have uh just come off stage

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,960
um talking about the the cyber cyber

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,500
warfare in uh in Ukraine

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,220
um

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,480
and um yeah we um we sort of saw your

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,899
your timeline in one of your last slides

11
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:38,640
uh one one of the things

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,180
um that I was I was thinking about was

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,120
it was was fairly obvious that that the

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,059
Russians hadn't prepared for the kind of

15
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,520
resistance or resilience

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,399
um on on the Cyber side from the

17
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,320
ukrainians what what are what are some

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,640
of your your thoughts on that

19
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,059
um I would say that

20
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:06,960
the Russians were not prepared for the

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,580
Ukrainian resilience period yeah

22
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,799
um it it we have to stop seeing the

23
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,860
Cyber War as something different from

24
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,200
what it's like they they weren't

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,740
prepared for the resistance of the

26
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,920
Ukrainian Air Force now it was the

27
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,240
totality of the Ukrainian are resistance

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,799
they

29
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,780
they hoped to break the ukrainians will

30
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,479
with the combination of fiscal attacks

31
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,220
and cyber attacks and paralyze them into

32
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,640
submission and it failed

33
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,380
I'm not sure whether we're you know too

34
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,020
of which part was the Cyber resilience

35
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,000
who much was the territorial Defense

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,479
Shooting up tanks and so on but the

37
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,880
totality of the Ukrainian defense of

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,100
which the Cyber defense was an important

39
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,960
part yeah

40
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,679
um totally shocked and we actually had a

41
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,040
an episode on a secular sport costume

42
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,160
where we discussed a cyber warfare uh

43
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,160
versus the genetic Warfare

44
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,340
we were thinking you know does really

45
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,739
cyber warfare I mean we're talking about

46
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,840
hybrid Warfare here but but does does

47
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,680
cyber warfare has to have a place in

48
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,319
once once you've rolled the tanks across

49
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,920
the border if you look at the way that

50
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,260
they planned it they it didn't seem that

51
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,540
they had very much in their Arsenal in

52
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,940
terms of a follow-up no exactly like

53
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,580
that sort of uh like that sort of sort

54
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,319
of we try to show like the last white

55
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,540
bird it did seems to have floss within

56
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,700
it yeah but also on my sort of even

57
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,440
though I I love computers and then

58
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,620
malware and analyzing it like

59
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,019
the Cyber is important all the way until

60
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:05,420
it's not important yes so like now

61
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,040
cyber sort of it's it's it's a part but

62
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,720
sort of that's not the whole game place

63
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,099
yes

64
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,680
yeah definitely say like a

65
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,180
it has downplayed I would say it's

66
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,760
importance now yeah and because there

67
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,760
are a lot of a lot of places around the

68
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,099
world and I I know some some companies I

69
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,420
work for

70
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,260
um we were preparing for massive cyber

71
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,140
attacks in sort of the wake of the

72
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,040
Ukrainian aggression from from Russia

73
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,500
but we haven't seen much of that no but

74
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,040
we were in in that

75
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,140
podcast we didn't do that we're looking

76
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,739
at the Microsoft report yeah and

77
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,720
maybe they're

78
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,959
they all data is skewed right yes but

79
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,299
but they were saying that the majority

80
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,640
of attacks they saw

81
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,519
were not actually on Ukrainian but but

82
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,580
on like NATO allies and such yeah and

83
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,980
most of those I would think are are

84
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,879
probably attributed to to activists I

85
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,920
mean there was like a lot of lessons to

86
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,599
learn from this sort of as a Defender

87
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,360
that sort of I mean defense is possible

88
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,880
even like even though you're targeted

89
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,320
quite heavily and even like you're

90
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,418
losing yeah but still Asian State actors

91
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,280
exactly but sort of by by having this

92
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,620
kind of resilience to to sort of strike

93
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,479
back and like okay you realize okay I'm

94
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,520
going probably gonna get hacked but how

95
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,139
can I restore quickly yes and that's

96
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,639
sort of that I think we're going to

97
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,440
learn a lot from what Ukraine has done

98
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,600
now that sort of yeah how to resist and

99
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,120
sort of come back but we yeah we argued

100
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,660
uh I mean Ukraine is probably the the

101
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,600
worst country to to Target with a with a

102
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,400
Cyber attack because you know they've

103
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,199
been constantly living with cyber

104
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,680
attacks since 2014. yeah yeah basically

105
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,360
yeah I mean that's yeah it's a Defender

106
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,520
yeah they developed a lot

107
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,400
we also have to you know be humble here

108
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,040
and say we still don't know all we know

109
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,280
is that in the initial Rush the initial

110
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,540
days

111
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,320
when hermetic wiper acid rain was used

112
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,320
to paralyze Ukraine's communicate

113
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,660
standard Communications and The

114
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,320
ukrainians Scrambled a form of Defense

115
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,340
um

116
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,740
it may take many years before we know

117
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,080
how close were the Russians to actually

118
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,479
succeed yeah maybe if zelenski had taken

119
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,680
the offer to get a cab out of keep to be

120
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,280
evacuated things would have crumbled we

121
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,460
don't know we it's obvious now

122
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,039
but we don't know how close they were to

123
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:53,100
succeeding right

124
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,720
um another thing I've been thinking

125
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,460
about is is you know cyber warfare is

126
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,419
heavily used and sort of a gray Zone uh

127
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,160
when when you don't have an open

128
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,600
conflict

129
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,600
um like when you're the attacks on the

130
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,479
Ukrainian power grid for instance yeah

131
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,180
when you're trying to destabilize a

132
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,300
government or a country uh or you're

133
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,780
trying to attack a specific capability

134
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,240
capability Within

135
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,060
country than then cyber warfare is a

136
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,520
very useful tool and and there's there's

137
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,979
always the plausible deniability by an

138
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,259
aggressor uh that you know you can say

139
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,840
oh sorry that wasn't us it's just some

140
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,840
activist that happens to live in our

141
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,520
country yes but I would say like with

142
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,840
Russia it's sort of

143
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,880
they like to do Lucky they want to have

144
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,919
deniability but like it does but yeah

145
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,860
it's not us but yeah it's us yeah kind

146
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,639
of like

147
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,740
us and Israel and uh oh yeah oh yeah

148
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,300
yeah

149
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,819
but but you're right you're right also

150
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,479
in in in noticing that

151
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:04,460
um

152
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,840
cyber war is kind of a One-Shot weapon

153
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,600
and it works best on those who are not

154
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,180
prepared and thought about it and them

155
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,440
and haven't prepared properly

156
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,440
and hopefully a more Consciousness but

157
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,599
at the same time also I would say that

158
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,020
you know

159
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:31,580
we've seen how the

160
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,160
Russian arms the Russian tanks and so on

161
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,380
there weren't quite as good as we

162
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,020
thought they were they obviously can't

163
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,819
match you know

164
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,160
um I don't know what would happen if it

165
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,319
was the U.S cyber command who were

166
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,020
trying to go after your country instead

167
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,240
of sandworm how much worse would that be

168
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,960
so maybe we may maybe they were just not

169
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,259
all as good as we have been told they

170
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:05,099
were yeah they they obviously like to

171
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:10,620
use our fear or sun worm to

172
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,639
um to as political too yes and of course

173
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,639
that that is uh that is part of the

174
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,020
propaganda War yeah

175
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,099
and

176
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:26,280
um you know there's there's I think it's

177
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,960
it's also

178
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,419
um important to see that there's so much

179
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,360
lack of knowledge

180
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,799
in

181
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,399
a society like our country what is a

182
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,799
Cyber attack journalists don't know

183
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,620
anything no they write cyber attacks

184
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,660
whether it's a DDOS attack

185
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,000
attempted Espionage break-in or a

186
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,760
forlorn cyber war attack it's all Cyber

187
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,220
attack and we note this especially on

188
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,580
January 14 attack

189
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,700
that it was the DDOS attacks and knocked

190
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,800
out

191
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,839
that was what ended up in

192
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,040
first page news even here

193
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,279
the real whispergate destructive attack

194
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:21,540
that was a page 10 footnote compared to

195
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,399
how much everyone's writing about these

196
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,519
DDOS attack as if that was the big scary

197
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,600
one

198
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,899
yeah

199
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,420
but the time is very much into can you

200
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,700
show it to a journalist and can you

201
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,500
explain it yeah

202
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,959
to a reader yeah

203
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,380
um it's it's like we need

204
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,200
I think that's an important part we need

205
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,620
more understanding of these things in

206
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,540
our society because that is part of

207
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,000
building resilience that people don't

208
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,019
fall for the easy scarce because as you

209
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:04,200
notice you know some sometimes the fear

210
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,959
of the Cyber attack is worse than the

211
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,320
actual attack yeah and therefore

212
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,040
building knowledge in society among

213
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,260
journalists but also about Ordinary

214
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,820
People about

215
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,720
what a DDOS attack is and what it isn't

216
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,080
so we don't fall prey to the fear

217
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,360
because that speak when we become afraid

218
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,580
of things we don't understand they've

219
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,860
already won that psychological battle

220
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,920
Yeah and and also I think it's important

221
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,680
to understand that that what what we as

222
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,680
Defenders can do to uh to be prepared

223
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,480
like like you mentioned in your talk

224
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,519
about

225
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,339
having that incident response capability

226
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:51,240
and and training restoring systems from

227
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,720
scratch yeah because that's and and of

228
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,459
course the the more

229
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,980
preventive measures like segmenting and

230
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,459
making it harder to compromise a large

231
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:05,459
part of your network yeah but but again

232
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:08,399
you know I also think that

233
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,120
um

234
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,320
like we still have the problem with the

235
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,980
stigma of being hacked even if even if a

236
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,100
major Bank

237
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,620
suffer a DDOS attack and banks are

238
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,720
uniquely

239
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,100
vulnerable to DDOS attacks because

240
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,260
people always get scared if they can't

241
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,940
access their money of obvious reasons

242
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,940
there there's still this

243
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,060
instinctive reaction to try and say as

244
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,800
little as possible

245
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,579
try to pretend it never happened hope it

246
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,800
doesn't make it to page one so we don't

247
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,040
have to even discuss it

248
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,800
instead of trying to own the information

249
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,040
space because if you say nothing

250
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,980
you are going to leave the information

251
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,860
space open to these hacktivists who have

252
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:08,579
everything to win by blowing up their

253
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:11,100
accomplishment way out of proportion yes

254
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,800
and and they own the narrative they own

255
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,000
the narrative

256
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,519
and they make money out of it and that

257
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,100
means they're gonna do it again yeah I I

258
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,800
think that's a very valid point that you

259
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,440
want you want to own the flow of

260
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,180
information when when you're hit by a

261
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,100
different attack yeah because you want

262
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,980
to be up front there perhaps even have a

263
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,420
press release

264
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,980
um ready

265
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,560
um yeah and think about that in advance

266
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,180
how do we handle the media how do we

267
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,040
handle public relations how do we handle

268
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,279
Communications with our customers yeah

269
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,899
um so yeah I think that's that's very

270
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,880
good yeah definitely but I would say

271
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,620
like awesome to look our our own

272
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,320
business in the sense of we not might be

273
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,180
more humble towards

274
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,220
the companies and organizations that get

275
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,139
hit yeah that sort of if they come out

276
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:00,899
okay they made some maybe some some easy

277
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,120
mistakes but still you know we shouldn't

278
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,800
ridicule them because they are victims

279
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,800
yeah and and I think we have a lot of

280
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,300
learn as well in the in so in this

281
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,880
business that okay there was a XP that

282
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,820
RDP like now it's like they're actually

283
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,320
a victim and yeah and we should treat

284
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,180
them as a victim and give the support

285
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,740
instead so that's right I think I mean

286
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,660
it's a bit like blaming a rape victim

287
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,120
for addressing you know provocatively

288
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,320
yeah exactly yeah you know but isn't it

289
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,639
one one

290
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,880
basic problems is that

291
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,700
invent it usually turns out that someone

292
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,740
was hacked for something simple either

293
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,180
someone somewhere

294
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,339
was full-linked downloading and clicking

295
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:49,200
on something bad

296
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,480
or it was a

297
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,779
remote access system with

298
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:59,339
however old vulnerabilities or it was

299
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,339
a bad account

300
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:05,779
but but the problem is like

301
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,160
like you are trying to produce something

302
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,779
you're trying to sell something you're

303
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,459
trying to do something

304
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,200
and you have

305
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,839
so many different systems

306
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,079
and in order to

307
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,880
be secure

308
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,100
yeah

309
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,220
you need to make sure that all of those

310
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,760
if the goal is to prevent the initial

311
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,420
attack yeah yeah and you need to be good

312
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,980
many different things

313
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,959
so it's it's why it's cooler to be a

314
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,579
blue teamer because you have to have

315
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,740
everything right or your teamer just has

316
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,560
to find one flaw yeah and they're like

317
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,899
yes I know I mean it can be like we also

318
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,820
work within that industrial security

319
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,560
space that's even a more challenge in

320
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,480
the sense like okay you can patch once a

321
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,839
year yeah yeah how do we secure it yeah

322
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,899
yeah exactly and that's why it's so

323
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:06,600
important to have

324
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,560
um a managed detect and disarm service

325
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,500
because once he's in

326
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,040
the script is flipped then it he who has

327
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,279
to just do one mistake and he's found

328
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:23,000
out yeah

329
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,660
yeah that's good

330
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,180
that's a good way of putting it

331
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,000
awesome well um I realized I forgot to

332
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,480
introduce you sorry

333
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,380
um

334
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,620
you uh you're from from trusick and

335
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,079
