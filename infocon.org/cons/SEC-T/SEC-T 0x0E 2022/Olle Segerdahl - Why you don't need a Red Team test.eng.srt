1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,020
okay so uh I'm gonna try something a bit

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,599
different here today because I didn't

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,460
prepare

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,799
um so instead of having slides I'm just

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,900
gonna talk I have some notes at least

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,880
but I'm not going to show you any slides

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,699
so you'll have to to look at me instead

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,460
or at the lovely invitation

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,039
that's up on the screen to the October

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,740
hack event that we are inviting you all

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,599
to

12
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,820
um there's more info

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,480
on the URL that the QR code leads to

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,520
all right fair enough what was I

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,219
supposed to talk about well

16
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,120
the title of the talk was why you don't

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,520
need a red team test

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,100
and while we at with secure pride

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,620
ourselves on being a European market

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,140
leader in those kinds of scenario based

21
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,140
red team tests we quite often have

22
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,879
discussions with clients where we

23
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,680
quickly understand that the value that

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,900
they would get out of such a test might

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,640
not be in comparison with what they

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,380
could get spending that money in other

27
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,119
ways and that's kind of what I wanted to

28
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,580
talk about here today so quickly I'm

29
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,580
going to go through

30
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,340
four different scenarios that we've come

31
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,460
across and try to explain to you why

32
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,119
that scenario might not be a good reason

33
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,479
to do a full-scale scenario based red

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,560
team test

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,060
so the first is that we encounter a

36
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,619
organization that may know that they

37
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,780
have internal problems with I.T security

38
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,520
they might have weak security practices

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,759
but what they think that they need is to

40
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,979
get more support from the leadership in

41
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,840
the company sometimes we hear stuff like

42
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,540
we just want to scare the sea level we

43
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,280
want them to understand that you know

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,899
this is serious stuff and we need more

45
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,880
budget or whatever

46
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,780
and while this may be and this is kind

47
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,780
of the hardest one for me to tackle uh

48
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,880
while this may be a good idea in some

49
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,038
cases you're spending quite a lot of

50
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,120
money for something with a very unsecure

51
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,580
uncertain outcome you don't know if that

52
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,099
thing that you present to the board will

53
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,300
actually make a really big difference

54
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,239
and at the same time you may have spent

55
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,160
a lot of money that doesn't go directly

56
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,099
into improving the situation

57
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,520
um so what I would perhaps propose in

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,879
those situations is that you look at

59
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,700
doing something a bit more uh tightly

60
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,860
scoped maybe start with The Insider

61
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,060
scenario if you're a big enough

62
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,160
organization you'll have some kind of

63
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,200
understanding from leadership that you

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,620
know there could be an Insider who wants

65
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,540
to do something bad and work from there

66
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,080
and kind of move from a compromised

67
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,379
workstation to one important Target and

68
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,360
then that kind of compressed scope would

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,340
give you the same kind of visibility

70
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,640
into ID security problems as a

71
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,879
communication aid but for a

72
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,640
significantly reduced budget the other

73
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,640
thing that we often hear is that we just

74
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,040
want you to hack us and tell us how you

75
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,480
you hacked us so we can fix all the

76
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,700
problems and that kind of goes to a

77
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,560
fundamental misunderstanding of what a

78
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,900
scenario-based red team actually is and

79
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,840
and what it can do for you so if what

80
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,700
you really want to do is get a better

81
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,200
understanding of what the

82
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,000
vulnerabilities may be in your

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,599
environment and what attack paths there

84
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,940
are from A to B then there are

85
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,159
significantly cheaper options than doing

86
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,319
a scenario based red team full scale

87
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,959
end-to-end cyber exercise

88
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,560
such as working together with the it

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,379
organization in like a white box I

90
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,060
really don't like that term but I don't

91
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,459
have an alternative

92
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,580
type of Engagement where

93
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,120
your Consulting partner would kind of

94
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,840
through through interviews and workshops

95
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,019
with the IT department get a quick

96
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:08,220
quickly get an understanding of the

97
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,080
scope of the situation and then try out

98
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,720
many more attack paths than you would be

99
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,000
able to do within a scenario based red

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,220
team test so that you get better

101
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,339
coverage and broader results instead of

102
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,079
just getting okay we hacked you this one

103
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,860
way

104
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,139
uh because that doesn't give you enough

105
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,000
information to understand what other

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,979
things may be in the environment that

107
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,139
also would provide an attacker a means

108
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,840
to get to their goal

109
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,040
the other thing that we often hear is

110
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,080
that we we want to confirm our detection

111
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,880
capabilities we've invested lots of

112
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,139
money in this sock function or we've

113
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:45,479
contracted with a security solution

114
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,580
provider service provider that does

115
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,199
detection for us

116
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,360
and we just want to know that you know

117
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,919
will they catch you when you try to hack

118
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,120
us

119
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,720
um

120
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,880
when it comes to validating detection

121
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,500
capabilities there are much more

122
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,020
efficient ways to do that as well and

123
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,840
again working together with the people

124
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,340
who are working on the blue team on the

125
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,500
defending side actually gives them more

126
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,840
value and gives them more opportunities

127
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,259
to learn and improve than if they are

128
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,300
totally unaware that there's an exercise

129
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,820
going on and you're just hoping that

130
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,860
they will catch something or that they

131
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,720
will get good feedback after the

132
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,759
exercise that will allow them to to

133
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,740
improve I actually heard some really

134
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,199
horrible stories about that kind of

135
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,060
thing happening and the blue team just

136
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,520
getting you know a report 18 months

137
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,960
later telling them that something

138
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,940
happened 18 months ago and you need to

139
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,500
do better next time which isn't really

140
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,120
helpful

141
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,520
um the other thing that we hear uh

142
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,580
sometimes is well it has to be a real

143
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,340
Attack you have to uh you have to do an

144
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,199
attack like a real attacker would do

145
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,840
with the same uh you know methods and it

146
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,020
has to be kind of an end-to-end scenario

147
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,780
and while that there may be some Merit

148
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,320
to that it also is something that can't

149
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,080
be fetishized to the point of you know

150
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,120
it being

151
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,780
um

152
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,240
uh contrary to the objectives of the

153
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,120
exercise so what we often see is that

154
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,979
you know there are limitations to what

155
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,199
you can do in a consultant engagement

156
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,500
like a scenario based red team exercise

157
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,699
for example there's always a time limit

158
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,340
we can't spend you know half a year

159
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,900
waiting for somebody to click on a

160
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,819
phishing link there has to be another

161
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,460
way of doing it we can't

162
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,419
perhaps you know use a real exploit

163
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:37,380
against your VPN box because you know we

164
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,360
can't wait until the next vulnerability

165
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,520
comes along and we don't have you know

166
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,860
time and money to spend on kind of

167
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,419
researching zero day vulnerabilities so

168
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,100
we can use the same methods that an

169
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,600
attacker would there are much better

170
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,360
ways of doing something that gives a

171
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,860
realistic scenario but skipping these

172
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,800
limitations in an intelligent way so for

173
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,440
example when it comes to making use of

174
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,680
exploits to gain access through an

175
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,960
internet exposed VPN server we could

176
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,660
easily kind of play out that scenario by

177
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,340
saying well what would an attacker gain

178
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,340
if next year your pulse VPN box is

179
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,560
vulnerable again what would an attacker

180
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,060
gain if they exploited that well they

181
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,940
would gain access to this network here

182
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,160
okay so give us access to that Network

183
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,139
through another host and then we'll move

184
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,440
from there as if it was a zero day

185
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,599
attack

186
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,180
um so the kind of solution here that I'm

187
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,520
trying to get to is that there are many

188
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,580
different steps in in end-to-end

189
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,120
scenario based red team test that

190
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,720
can actually be exercised in isolation

191
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,539
if you're more focused on getting better

192
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,699
detection then maybe focusing on

193
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,639
detection and validating the data

194
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,139
sources and Analysis you have with those

195
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,880
data sources might give you better

196
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,819
results in terms of more Improvement for

197
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,319
the amount of time and money you

198
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,840
invested into it so

199
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,759
I said that you know we pride ourselves

200
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,120
on being Market leaders in this segment

201
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,319
why am I saying you shouldn't buy a red

202
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,880
team test from us well what I'm saying

203
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,800
is that there are other things that

204
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,139
might give you value but there's other

205
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,879
things that a red team test can do that

206
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,160
you won't get from those types of more

207
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,280
collaborative purple team exercises

208
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,819
um

209
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,680
the question that a red team test

210
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,240
scenario based red team test actually

211
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,779
can help you answer that many of these

212
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,880
other ideas that I talked about really

213
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,659
can't help you with is the response and

214
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,179
eradication part of the process there's

215
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,820
an unhealthy obsession with detection in

216
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,640
the industry right now I think

217
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,860
whereas what really matters it can you

218
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,080
evict an attacker a determined attacker

219
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,959
from your environment before they reach

220
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,000
their goal before you get ransomware

221
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,100
before your IP gets stolen whatever it

222
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,660
might be that their goal is

223
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,300
and that is something that a red team

224
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,480
test can help you answer because what it

225
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,420
does is it gives you a scenario based uh

226
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,180
test of your organization as a whole not

227
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,040
just detection not just the prevention

228
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,920
aspects not just your response but

229
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,980
everything together and gives you an

230
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,620
opportunity to understand

231
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,940
where people aren't working well

232
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,920
together where processes aren't in place

233
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,640
to help that kind of flow work smoothly

234
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,980
and that's something where a red team

235
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,080
test actually can provide a lot of value

236
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,200
but talk to your provider don't just ask

237
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,600
for red team test and insist on scenario

238
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,399
based red team testing if what you

239
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,620
really want is to improve your security

240
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,620
posture then have a discussion about

241
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,620
what you might be able to do before you

242
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,320
go to the full-scale scenario based red

243
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,180
team test that that was all I had to say

244
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,519
if you don't agree with what I said

245
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,080
please come see me afterwards I'd love

246
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,600
to hear your perspectives on this if you

247
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,899
do agree buy me a beer

248
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:05,279
feel free to talk to me afterwards and

249
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,240
thank you very much for listening

250
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,399
[Applause]
