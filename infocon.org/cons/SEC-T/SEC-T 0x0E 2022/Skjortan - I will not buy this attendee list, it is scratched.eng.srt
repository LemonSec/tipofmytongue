1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,880
um and we actually have

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,820
um a thing at SEC T that if you're on

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,700
the the committee on the organizing

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,700
committee or if under review board you

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,740
cannot do any talks including lightning

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,440
talks so I'm gonna break that tradition

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,760
here today

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,160
I'm gonna have to break it uh because

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,439
this year we had a lot of sponsors that

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,240
were released like oh my God guys you

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,340
have been hacked you you have been

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,539
hacked we have like people that are

13
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,180
selling all your attendee list

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,860
um so so this lightning talk is going to

15
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,680
be very short I'm going to disclose the

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,620
content of all our stolen attendee lists

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,140
I Was preparing slides because I did a

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,640
similar talk at Black Cat where I

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,320
actually bought all the at the new list

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,719
for Black Cat and figured out that they

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,620
were indeed just scraped off of LinkedIn

22
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,760
but I was very curious because we we the

23
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,100
Run sector we're very privacy oriented

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,559
and you can buy your tickets with

25
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,600
Anonymous email and we don't keep any

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,640
emails we don't keep any receipt from

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,159
stripes we don't keep any data so it's

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,360
like how did they hack us so via five

29
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,939
different proxies I asked them I given

30
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,020
people a spending limit of 999 dollars

31
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,080
to buy the second attendee list and as

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,880
you can see on my slides

33
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,540
this is all we got uh so so basically

34
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,479
the Cyber criminals nowaday they they is

35
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,320
like

36
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,200
it's a just-in-time delivery so first we

37
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,939
email everyone's like oh would you like

38
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,460
to buy the attendee list for SEC T then

39
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,079
if you get some people that do want to

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,180
buy them then you Outsource the hacking

41
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,880
to actually get it or the scraping and

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,979
we got Sierra replies I used five

43
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,720
different proxies to actually buy that

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,220
in the list

45
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,079
um so I just want to say you can rest

46
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,899
well assured sekti does not store any

47
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,939
personal information about you or your

48
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,399
purchases and we keep the email

49
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,259
addresses until the conference is run

50
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,520
then we delete everything each year and

51
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,020
if someone wants to sell you that in

52
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,000
English then you think that it will make

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,860
sense to buy it

54
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,879
um

55
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,459
don't buy it it's scratched it's really

56
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:17,819
bad quality and literally we got cro uh

57
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,160
things back so that was just the the

58
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,770
content of my lighting dock

59
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,029
[Applause]
