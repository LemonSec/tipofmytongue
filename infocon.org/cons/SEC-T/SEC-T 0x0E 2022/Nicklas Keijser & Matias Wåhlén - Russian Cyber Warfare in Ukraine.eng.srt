1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,020
[Applause]

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,400
thank you

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,120
um in this business we often like to

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,000
talk about War Stories

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,960
well this is real War Stories

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,760
and this is also I think one of the most

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,180
important stories of our time

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,679
the story of the Ukrainian people

9
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:34,079
defending their independence and freedom

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,020
against Russian aggression

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,840
and it is about

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,040
cyber conflict when it's a part of real

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,719
war

14
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,480
and some of the things you've learned

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,700
about

16
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,460
defending against cyber attacks

17
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,739
has to be thrown out the window because

18
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,860
there is a new set of rules altogether

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,099
my name is William

20
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,040
so I spent

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,820
most of my working life in Swedish

22
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,139
intelligence 30 years

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,780
before two years ago I joined true SEC

24
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,140
as threat intelligence expert and my

25
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,119
colleague my name is Nick class caser I

26
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,820
also work at trusick I do a little bit

27
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,740
of everything my analysis is one of the

28
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,220
things and ICS security as well

29
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,140
um I would say it's humbling so many

30
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,060
people here like

31
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,700
I wonder the combined amount of segment

32
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,220
faults has been pushed by this audience

33
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,840
here

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,320
yeah thank you for coming

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,400
so

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,899
like all good stories uh this story

37
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:54,799
needs an enemy

38
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,680
and this is what we're going to talk a

39
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,820
lot about

40
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,119
the gru unit

41
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:07,560
74455 known to most of us as sand worm

42
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,239
that is the Russian Armed Forces cyber

43
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,700
warfare unit

44
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,420
um they have a headquarters in chimki uh

45
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,099
suburb to Moscow

46
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,980
and they have been active in Ukraine

47
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,440
since 2015.

48
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,560
when the ukrainians say that the war

49
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,599
didn't start 24 February it started in

50
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,020
2014.

51
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,020
the activities of sand worm is one of

52
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,640
the reasons

53
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,440
this is just a quick list of the attacks

54
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,599
attributed by Western intelligence to

55
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,340
sandworm black energy the first

56
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,580
large-scale attack against

57
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,739
the Ukrainian electricity grid was

58
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,480
actually two waves of attacks not petya

59
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,280
the most destructive

60
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,640
um Cyber attack probably ever

61
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,480
French elections Olympic Destroyer

62
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,959
Attack trying to sabotage the uh the

63
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,980
opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics

64
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,599
and the attacks against the Parliament

65
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,379
of Georgia in 2019

66
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:31,140
there's also another opponent here an

67
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,500
unidentified your unit called Amber bear

68
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,620
it is also likely a Russian army cyber

69
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,580
War unit

70
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,360
possibly it's probably subordinate to

71
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,640
sound warm it could be

72
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,440
um a military District the lower the

73
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,540
Next Level under the Central Command in

74
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,780
Russia organizing their own it could

75
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,739
possibly even be tied to the Belarus

76
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,299
Armed Forces

77
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,760
and they have been active in Ukraine

78
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,540
since at least 2021.

79
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,840
The Defenders the underdogs in this

80
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,379
attack is the state service for special

81
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,780
Communications information protection of

82
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,478
Ukraine or cert UA

83
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,199
located in cave established in 2006

84
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,919
and tasks of Defending

85
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,599
the Ukrainian cyberspace

86
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,580
the first of three major waves of

87
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,580
attacks that we're going to discuss

88
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,380
uh began already on January 14th

89
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,580
this is before the war actually started

90
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,880
this is an intimidation attack

91
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,400
this is when the Russian army had

92
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,860
deployed all around the borders of

93
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,300
Ukraine

94
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,680
there were intense political pressure on

95
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,880
the ukrainians and

96
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,380
Russia basically demanded submission

97
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,600
and they were probably going to invade

98
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,360
regardless what ukrainians did

99
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,060
from what we understand

100
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,680
but

101
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,199
the task here was to scare

102
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,120
ukrainians to basically give up without

103
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,360
a fight

104
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,539
the same day this attack we're going to

105
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,820
describe happened

106
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,539
um

107
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:47,460
and Russians arrested 13 members of the

108
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,580
our evil ransomware guy

109
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,139
first of all it's important to know that

110
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,180
at that time our evil was basically

111
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,820
defunct they had stopped their

112
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,820
operations they were they were gone

113
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,199
but

114
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,660
the fact that they were arrested on the

115
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,840
same day was obviously part of the same

116
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,180
Russian diplomacy

117
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,500
hey

118
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,620
you have a choice now in the West

119
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,100
you can look the other way and we will

120
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,320
help you we will arrest all those pesky

121
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,120
ransomware gangs you've been complaining

122
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,380
about

123
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,979
or

124
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,419
will let low sound worm

125
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,380
look more specifically at the January

126
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,380
14th Cyber attack this time it was Amber

127
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,380
bear the smaller unit

128
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,100
they were targeting government and Banks

129
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,419
they used one wiper tool called whisper

130
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:51,199
gate but they also

131
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,120
amplify this attack with DDOS attacks

132
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,400
web defacements

133
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,180
things that really doesn't constitute

134
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,419
the serious breach but it gets attention

135
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,240
it gets news

136
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,080
it tells people that oh it's scary our

137
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,139
systems it works actually better

138
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,639
than the real destruction

139
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,860
um and the objective as I said

140
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,560
intimidation

141
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,620
send the message that we own your

142
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,620
networks resistance is futile

143
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,880
so yeah looking at the sort of technical

144
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,220
running the wipers

145
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,460
I'm over here but some technical issues

146
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,380
so there's just you have to trust me

147
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,880
when we run it it's going to look like

148
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,860
this

149
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,259
on reboot uh

150
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:49,020
so you have this kind of fake ransomware

151
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,199
note once the computer starts and it's a

152
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,960
fake ransomware note it's not real this

153
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,060
is from the wiper and we got another

154
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,500
like a little bit of a technical Deep

155
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,699
dive into this one uh to touch base this

156
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,160
is sort of the general feeling from it

157
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,160
um what's interesting they use uh

158
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,099
the compiler I mean GB which it's I

159
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,660
haven't seen I don't see it that much

160
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,560
but sort of looking at at the wiper this

161
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,860
is the the main program

162
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,139
uh and it actually it's a quite crappy

163
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,919
wiper but uh what I want to show with

164
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,840
this picture is like this is more or

165
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,180
less the whole program and this is what

166
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,560
it takes to make because it's actually a

167
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,240
cyber weapon when you're looking at it

168
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,640
you know from a from a sort of

169
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,919
computer analyst point you just see the

170
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,958
bits and bytes but if you back out it's

171
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,640
actually this is a weapon that has been

172
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,679
used for destructive measures and that's

173
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,899
then you kind of understand the

174
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,120
seriousness about it

175
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,779
but if we jump a little bit into the to

176
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:55,500
the the wiper itself but but does it do

177
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,860
first it use the API called create file

178
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,720
I have a point I actually have two two

179
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,160
screens let's see if we can do this

180
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,779
because I can't point that if I point

181
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,779
here you don't see no here so uh if you

182
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,880
use create file let's see over there as

183
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,060
well uh there and what create file it

184
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,580
doesn't sort of it also opens a file but

185
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,920
what it does it opens the row access to

186
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,899
the disk

187
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,360
and sort of what it sort of what wants

188
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,019
to write is hidden within one of the

189
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:28,080
resources and that's the top resource

190
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,839
and you can see the resource what's sort

191
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,120
of written down here and that's the fake

192
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,040
ransomware note that sort of that's

193
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,839
going to be written into the master boot

194
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,160
records I will show the later on but

195
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,779
that's sort of that's baked within

196
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,540
within the binary resource there

197
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,080
and sort of once it runs it writes

198
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,660
straight to the disk at the MBR starting

199
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,899
at zero so to the let's see now to the

200
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,700
left this is sort of a normal

201
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,580
functioning MBR

202
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,080
to the left let's see is it to the left

203
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,779
or to the right to the one

204
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,220
I don't know what love to write yeah

205
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,279
that pointing that direction uh that

206
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,959
that's the normal functioning one and

207
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,000
this one this is a corrupt one after the

208
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,360
wiper is run and you might notice you

209
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,760
see here your hard drive has been

210
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,279
encrypted uh

211
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,380
do the people the people over there see

212
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,680
when I point there or should I yeah

213
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,180
so there you see that fake fake

214
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,459
ransomware note that that's sort of

215
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,040
shown to to the user

216
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,860
and sort of when I was digging into this

217
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,140
I actually sort of had to okay how does

218
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,240
the masterbook record work and I was

219
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,100
sort of how to give an interesting

220
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,360
lecture I thought that let's you know

221
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,560
share a little bit to what I learned

222
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,060
from the master boot record and they're

223
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,880
probably you know sort of Deep dive uh

224
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,680
reverse to say that this is like it is

225
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,600
for breakfast but for the rest of us I

226
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,860
thought this was a sort of good what

227
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,019
we're looking at and as you remember

228
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,760
might have noticed on the first this is

229
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,160
sort of the things how it looks like

230
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,200
um the top one is the master boot

231
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,600
routine and that consists of the master

232
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,240
boot code and the error message

233
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,920
and if you remember the error message

234
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,380
that was the fake ransomware note but in

235
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,420
a proper one it says

236
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,720
uh portion loading operation system

237
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,640
missing so that's why they brought their

238
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,440
fake ransomware note

239
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,660
after that you have the portion table

240
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,600
and then you have the master boot

241
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,540
signature five five AAA in the bottom

242
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,579
down there so that's sort of if you see

243
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:27,720
that that's the master boot record

244
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,500
signature

245
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,060
uh I do quite a lot of Melbourne

246
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,360
analysis and I'm a big fan of cyber chef

247
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,360
and you can actually load this kind of

248
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,140
this this opcodes into cyber chef and

249
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,820
you can they have this super nice

250
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,300
function called disassemble it's 86 and

251
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,360
it turns these op codes into assembly so

252
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,279
this is actually the master boot record

253
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,440
program sort of I think it's a nice

254
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,459
feature

255
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,260
here's a little tip

256
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,360
and if you look on the sort of this the

257
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,279
portion table that stuff that sort of it

258
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:05,760
writes over it it sort of

259
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,120
that's the signature eight zero here uh

260
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,820
that indicates this is a bootable sector

261
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,700
and then it goes down here to the zeros

262
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,019
here that says it's not the bootable

263
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:16,940
sector

264
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,019
and uh

265
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,500
part of this big string you have the the

266
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,880
portion type and then you have the

267
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,380
starting sector but this is sort of

268
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,760
that's the whole thing this white

269
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,440
products it overwrites everything that's

270
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,540
why it becomes corrupt

271
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,180
uh but you can actually pull this into

272
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,240
zero one zero the the hex editor which

273
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,320
is a

274
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,640
super dupe if you're going to buy one

275
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,440
program that's the one you should buy

276
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,300
and I have no sponsorship yeah just like

277
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,519
the stuff and it actually parses the

278
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,260
whole Master boot record things out for

279
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:50,040
you for free so just a little tip

280
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,740
foreign

281
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,540
we are focusing on the wipers but they

282
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,600
also had some other nasty stuff uh when

283
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,899
they did it sort of one of the things

284
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:02,339
wiper they also did sort of because that

285
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:04,200
destroys the computers but they also did

286
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,959
ransomware and it is you know sort of

287
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:09,060
two-stage thingy and this is the stage

288
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,899
number two uh which had this

289
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:15,000
something.exe I don't read Russian uh

290
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,480
file that sort of was a fake file and it

291
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,000
was a net file

292
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,040
and maybe a little bit too small but it

293
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,800
had this kind of down x x low x x I

294
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,779
think you want to download something and

295
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,820
it downloaded a picture from uh well

296
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,320
claimed to be a picture from a Discord

297
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,320
Channel but that picture was actually

298
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,139
not a picture it was an e well it was a

299
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:41,519
file let's say like that it was a file

300
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,700
the stage three looked like this

301
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,860
and

302
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,959
does anything anyone see here what it is

303
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,339
it says like it starts to say like

304
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:52,820
cooler and something something something

305
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,440
said m in the bottom

306
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,220
so it's a it's a MC file backwards that

307
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,600
what should pull down they're kind of

308
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,600
they try to hide their exe in sort of

309
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,060
turning everything around so it's an exe

310
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,339
so it's a relocation and uh so this is

311
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:10,620
and this is the malware also not malware

312
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,540
they ran somewhere they spread off their

313
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,339
after the multiple records they like

314
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,940
these kind of double destruction

315
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,100
back to Matthias

316
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,360
yeah

317
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,380
so how did Ukraine respond to this first

318
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,940
attack

319
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,459
well one thing that we will come back to

320
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,380
over and over again

321
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,000
is that Ukraine has been under attack

322
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,079
for eight years by a very highly

323
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,079
qualified state sponsored actors

324
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:47,699
and they've realized that when you given

325
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:50,519
the text of technology today and give it

326
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,420
the capacity of threat actors like the

327
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,600
Russians like sandworm

328
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,440
Total Protection is not possible

329
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
you also need

330
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,260
strong response you have to have people

331
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,139
that can quickly go in and restore

332
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,079
what's been damaged

333
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,839
I can't just count on always being able

334
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,019
to stopping it so that's one of the

335
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,519
things they're doing

336
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,459
but the rest of their response because

337
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,220
this was there was a not a military

338
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,579
attack there was a political attack is

339
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:32,779
to get a political response

340
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:36,240
identify the attacker make sure that

341
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,120
everybody knows this was not ransomware

342
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,579
this was a state-sponsored threat act

343
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:43,500
that it was the Russians going after

344
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,300
that and it's also reaching out

345
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,820
to allies to try to build

346
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:57,620
find uh others there's a lot of both

347
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,720
private and state actors from the rest

348
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,480
World who's trying to

349
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,899
uh want to support Ukraine and they

350
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,720
start to build and I said that something

351
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,000
more than just your own capacity

352
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,740
for the real storm

353
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,579
that is coming

354
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,880
and the real storm

355
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,740
that came

356
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,320
the Strategic coup

357
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,720
if you wish

358
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,779
was February 23rd

359
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:36,420
hours before The Invasion on the 24th

360
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,579
Russia had planned

361
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:41,759
as we know now a lightning Invasion a

362
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,820
kind of Russian version of shock and awe

363
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,360
when they would just go hell for leather

364
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,639
from all directions

365
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,639
paralyze

366
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,800
Ukraine

367
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,579
and

368
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,560
decapitate the leadership

369
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,619
and just take over before the ukrainians

370
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,959
really managed to organize the proper

371
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,319
defense

372
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,540
the Cyber attack this time was the

373
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,079
threat actor San worm their target were

374
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:23,299
government and Communications

375
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,240
tools hermetic wiper and acid rain two

376
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,760
wipers one aimed at

377
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,200
government Communications sites like or

378
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,380
or like TV and so on

379
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:42,000
the other acid rain aimed at knocking

380
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,799
out

381
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,539
the

382
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:47,880
satellite routers used by the Ukraine

383
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,559
both the Ukraine Army and the government

384
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:53,720
for emergency communications

385
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,220
the aim to paralyze when the tanks

386
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,980
Russian tank roll over the Border

387
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,520
the Ukrainian leadership would not even

388
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,600
be able to give issue commands to their

389
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,840
forces what to do and hope that that

390
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,400
confusion would add to the fear

391
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,660
the overwhelming might of Russia so the

392
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,880
ukrainians would just lay down their

393
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,039
arms

394
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:31,640
cut the head of the opponent

395
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,039
so yeah now they bring out the big the

396
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,640
big guns uh this is sort of me trying to

397
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,380
run the Viper with a movie that's not

398
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,200
functional so it's gonna looks like this

399
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,900
uh once rebooted actually this one

400
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,419
reboots itself

401
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,260
and um

402
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,299
if you start looking at this

403
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:55,380
this uh wiper it was actually digitally

404
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,700
signed

405
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,700
but uh with a certificate from this

406
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,260
company called hermetic uh something uh

407
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,880
digital Limited

408
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,299
and that's a company in Cyprus that

409
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,580
there there's a computer gaming company

410
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,780
but he's

411
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,240
uh this was an interesting article uh

412
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,640
that sort of he is actually a he writes

413
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,559
scripts for computer games so he's not

414
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,780
like not a programmer he's a

415
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,059
scriptwriter and he had no idea that

416
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:25,740
they had registered his certificate in

417
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,380
his company's name

418
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,880
and this was actually registered in

419
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,760
April the year before so this was like

420
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,280
that sort of indicates that uh

421
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,559
this was gone this is like a cyber

422
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,539
weapon they had on the shelves uh for

423
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:42,660
you know for a rainy day

424
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,340
and if you start looking at this this

425
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,460
the Hermetic wiper uh it has some

426
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,200
interesting features if you look at the

427
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,660
resources it yeah this the sort of the

428
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,880
the symbol with this kind of gift wrap

429
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,900
package

430
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,360
but also within it they had this sort of

431
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,140
four drivers

432
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,419
and those drivers were sort of utilized

433
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,880
but sort of what kind of stuff was that

434
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,860
drivers and they were also digitally

435
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,260
signed by this the Chinese company

436
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,539
Chengdu Juve Tech

437
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:14,700
development

438
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,500
and if you took out those drivers and

439
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,320
then if you run them in virus total uh

440
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,840
you get seven hits but sort of from all

441
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,919
minor minor sort of Av endings like how

442
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,720
come sort of this sort of this

443
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,280
discrepancy

444
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,360
it turns out actually that this driver

445
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:37,020
is this he also's portion master

446
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,200
driver utility so it is

447
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,240
a valid program that's very popular in

448
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,120
China but they had baked this thing

449
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,039
within this wiper that they're going to

450
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,200
utilize later on so by itself it's not

451
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,220
malicious

452
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,380
but sort of it's it's good for for

453
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,900
threat hunting for instance sort of we

454
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,059
threat hunted for these drivers in our

455
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,220
customers like if you have it you know

456
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,320
it might be affected but maybe not but

457
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,419
sort of it gives an indication but yeah

458
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,580
it by itself it's actually to completely

459
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,660
legit program

460
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,720
uh yeah but this Viper it won't really

461
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,900
destroy everything so one of the feature

462
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,419
it disabled the the volume Shadow copy

463
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:19,679
so

464
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,620
uh sorry it disabled the crash dump so

465
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,500
you have to sort of try to remove any

466
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,780
sort of

467
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,280
assistance in in restoring stuff

468
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,140
forensically

469
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,900
because yeah if if it crashes stuff can

470
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,820
end up in the in the in the in the crash

471
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,780
dump and then data might be saved there

472
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,120
uh it also did this thingy this was also

473
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,919
a movie that's it's not functional but

474
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,780
the the Malwarebytes did an interesting

475
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,720
Discovery before the wiper starts it

476
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,520
does a lot of a lot of i o operations

477
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,500
and what it does is sort of is

478
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,659
defragment the disk sort of so it

479
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:57,480
spreads out the data so before the the

480
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,000
wiper is is running it sort of spreads

481
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,400
out the data which makes it harder to to

482
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,440
restore stuff as well so

483
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,539
it takes every measure it can to just

484
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:09,179
make it hard to restore any data it's

485
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:10,320
going to wipe

486
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,840
uh later on it's also just disabled the

487
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,900
volume shutter copy so if it will be any

488
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,720
sort of that will be there try to remove

489
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,120
that as well so as I said aiming for for

490
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,520
a complete destruction of this uh of the

491
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,780
computer

492
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,140
uh and then it actually saves this

493
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,020
driver after that uh after the disable

494
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,320
all these checks it saves this driver

495
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,440
from eosus to the disk and it creates

496
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,740
this service uh called SS

497
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,039
and and then before that it has two two

498
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,860
random letters and in this case it's

499
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,320
called tt.dr but every time you run it

500
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,220
it's called something else Dr dot sys

501
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,580
and before it wipes it actually uses the

502
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,880
the crypty API yes to generate noise

503
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,480
and then it uses this disk drive utility

504
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,200
to write to the disk with this random

505
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,020
noise data yes to destroy it

506
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,140
and it goes both for the master boot

507
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,179
record but it also goes for the mft as

508
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:18,419
well so really aims for Destruction so

509
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:21,600
to the left it's a normal mft and to the

510
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,260
right

511
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,480
it's sort of after the wiper is run and

512
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,380
it's just

513
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,280
noise yes scrambled aiming for yeah

514
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,900
trying to

515
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,500
destroy all data possible in there

516
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,659
it also had another feature within it

517
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:39,120
it's not in this presentation it says it

518
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,700
could actually spread also over the

519
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,559
another program but it was same with the

520
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,059
same digital signature so we could

521
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,960
spread over SMB and VMI as well so

522
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,679
within the environment sort of push this

523
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,480
Viper over the network as well aiming

524
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,820
for as I said complete destruction

525
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,220
and then parallel to this it also they

526
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,740
released this acid rain was also a Viper

527
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,559
but targeting more and more modems and

528
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:11,820
and uh satellites satellites yeah so

529
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,100
sort of this is as we speak like yes

530
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,960
before the 24s tried to disable as much

531
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,760
destabilizing as much as possible before

532
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,900
the forces are moving in

533
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:28,320
so this well-planned

534
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,840
well executed uh wiper that aimed at

535
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,299
basically make it impossible

536
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:39,600
for the Ukrainian leadership to even

537
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,780
give orders to their troops

538
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:47,120
uh how did they respond what did they do

539
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,740
well I think

540
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,980
all of us in here who have had any type

541
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,740
of interest in what's happening in

542
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,900
Ukraine it's probably seen a version of

543
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,659
the clip there you see

544
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:03,360
Vladimir zielinsky the president of the

545
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,600
Ukraine with some of his closest

546
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,360
advisors taking a selfie for Instagram

547
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,580
telling

548
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,000
people of Ukraine we are here

549
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,600
we are fighting please fight with us

550
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,419
and you know it's a great piece of

551
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,700
social media history

552
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,659
and you know one of those awesome

553
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:30,059
rah-rah moments on YouTube

554
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:33,240
but it's also

555
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,580
a way for a very media Sami president to

556
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:42,360
reach out to his people where normal

557
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,020
Communications are wrecked by this

558
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,220
Russian Cyber attack

559
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:52,980
they're using social media whatever they

560
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,020
can get handle

561
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,919
there is a report of Ukrainian Force

562
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:02,159
commanders knocking doors on civilian

563
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,120
homes begging to borrow their

564
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,200
uh civilian iPhone so they can try and

565
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,380
get FaceTime with high command because

566
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,980
their satellite communication is wiped

567
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,900
and done

568
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:24,980
so they but because of social media

569
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,260
phones what apps whatever they can get

570
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,700
hold of they managed to establish

571
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,860
Communications and give orders anyway

572
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,279
even though what is carefully planned to

573
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:39,299
be used

574
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:43,919
is wrecked by this Russian Cyber attack

575
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,620
this is also

576
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,620
in a very early where most of us me

577
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,900
included thought I was a question of

578
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,220
days

579
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,220
before the Russians had over on Kiev and

580
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,919
forced the government to flee

581
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,299
or be captured

582
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,720
you know we in a modern world you know

583
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,419
we might talk well it's a country still

584
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:15,299
a country if it's occupied you can also

585
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:17,700
say is a country a country it's a

586
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,799
government a still a government it's all

587
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:23,299
its data is captured

588
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,020
um suddenly it became a raise to save

589
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,100
the data

590
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,340
of the government of Ukraine all their

591
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,059
Ministries their population registers

592
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:37,860
whatever it is and all the date that are

593
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,120
together makes part of the Ukrainian

594
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,020
government

595
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,200
and up until that moment

596
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,320
they had followed the old rules the

597
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,299
rules for cyber security how do you

598
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:53,220
protect important

599
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,980
National Security data

600
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,320
well first of all

601
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,200
never store it outside the borders make

602
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,159
sure that you keep it in in a safe place

603
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:08,340
and you don't you don't use you know the

604
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,260
cloud things like that because that's

605
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,840
bad because you can't control who has

606
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,880
control over your data

607
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,539
so you bring it into a safe server

608
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:20,820
somewhere in the capital where it has

609
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,659
both physical and digital security

610
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:27,960
excellent well except

611
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,659
one cruise missile could hit that server

612
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:33,120
Hall and it'd be gone

613
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,860
what do we do

614
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,620
get into the cloud as fast as

615
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,779
possible

616
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:43,679
because saving that data

617
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,260
is more important than worrying whether

618
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,960
well you know if it's in the cloud

619
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,419
technically the Microsoft and then maybe

620
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:53,880
FBI that could be bad you know we don't

621
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,980
have time for that

622
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,500
we have a Russian army that might March

623
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,400
down the streets of Kiev tomorrow and

624
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,919
um it's another story it's not my story

625
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:08,460
to tell but there was actually an

626
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,500
international effort with both

627
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,380
government and private people where two

628
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,240
sick paid a tiny little part in the

629
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,880
edovich

630
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,580
assisting the Ukrainian government to

631
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,220
save their data out of the country

632
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,860
because that was suddenly you know the

633
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,120
way to

634
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,299
have some continuity to save there was

635
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:33,059
now to get it outside the country move

636
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:35,399
it to the cloud now

637
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,260
very different from what national

638
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:41,000
security is in peacetime

639
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,360
so I hope you like me look at that image

640
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,539
in a slightly different way now

641
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:51,120
it's still

642
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,559
an ultimately cool media Sabi president

643
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:58,620
who's probably born for this moment but

644
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:02,640
it's also like a desperate measure when

645
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,880
everything else was probably down from

646
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,659
this Cyber attack

647
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:11,460
but

648
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,940
As We Know

649
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,700
Ukraine persisted

650
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,820
Russia got bogged down militarily and

651
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,840
eventually had to retreat from Kiev

652
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,500
and realized that their plan to just

653
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,899
overwhelm

654
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:34,940
Ukraine almost without a fight had gone

655
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,200
badly wrong

656
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,559
and now they were in for Total War

657
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,039
a war where it was no longer enough

658
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:46,799
to try and pick off

659
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,620
the leadership or knock out the

660
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,120
community challenge

661
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,080
they were started the the methodical

662
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,419
work of actually trying to destroy

663
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:01,159
Ukraine

664
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,100
destroy its infrastructure

665
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,279
destroy the very idea that there is such

666
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:11,659
a place as Ukraine

667
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:16,799
and they used

668
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,799
Mass artillery

669
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:25,639
and they also used new Cyber weapons

670
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:30,419
the April 8th Cyber attack was the first

671
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:34,200
of these the threat actor was again Gru

672
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,559
unit 74455 sound worm

673
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:40,799
and the target was the energy grid

674
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,179
to try and force Ukraine into submission

675
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:49,440
by simply destroying the energy grid

676
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,020
and really you know if even if they

677
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,279
succeed

678
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,220
probably be worse for the civilians than

679
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,659
for their military

680
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:00,960
the military they they trained to

681
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,059
operate without off-grid

682
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:05,399
people not

683
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:09,120
the tools were caddy wiper a new wiper

684
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,260
and in Destroyer to malware specifically

685
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,620
to destroy industrial Control Systems

686
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,580
used in the energy grid and this time

687
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:25,158
they'll be activists destruction

688
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,039
so yeah the caddy wiper was actually run

689
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:34,380
first at some governance and then later

690
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,659
on it reappeared attacking the

691
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:39,840
electrical grid and this is sort of how

692
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,360
it looks like when first it blue screens

693
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,419
and then it boots after you run the

694
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:47,220
wiper

695
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,980
it looks like this and if you go deep

696
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,279
type into this one uh it has very few

697
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,620
functional calls to start with

698
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,320
but because that's why they use they use

699
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,960
this thing called stack strings which is

700
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,820
these kind of store data in in bytes so

701
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,299
then they can resolve it upon running it

702
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:11,279
and this is the kind of let's say

703
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,260
an obfuscation it's not hard to

704
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,320
de-obiscate but it's sort of

705
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,059
I would say they probably did it in a

706
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:21,740
haste this is a way you have to you know

707
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,840
maybe get around AV but yeah if you

708
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,140
defuscate it uh there's a excellent two

709
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,539
excellent tools by the people of mania

710
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:33,720
one called floss one called

711
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,320
uh Kappa and then you can actually

712
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,299
unravel them quite quickly and that's

713
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:41,340
sort of what's what I've done here

714
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,440
and see what and then start mapping

715
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,419
different functional calls to different

716
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:47,480
functions within there so

717
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,059
uh but yes just to see like yeah they're

718
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:54,059
trying to hide one interesting call they

719
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:56,340
did this this one is uh

720
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,480
and what it checks is if it's on a

721
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,960
primary domain controller it terminates

722
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,000
which indicates

723
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,320
they probably leveraged

724
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:14,099
a domain controller for the attack so if

725
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:15,960
they would run the Viper on their own

726
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,940
computer they don't want to destroy

727
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,040
themselves so to speak that's the guess

728
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,619
but they're kind of using this kind of

729
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:25,500
pushing it with the group policies

730
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,500
pushing these these wipers out from the

731
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,300
domain controller like using the same

732
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,359
tools ways that ransomware actors do

733
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,480
not to sort of sow off your own branch

734
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,339
is that the thing in English or is it

735
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:44,580
just it's a swinglish yeah Maybe

736
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,540
someone knows there yeah maybe Works uh

737
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,699
and then what it does is sort of it's uh

738
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,560
after it's done this it prefers for for

739
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,899
Data Destruction

740
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:58,020
and what it does it loops loops through

741
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,680
all the partitions so it starts at C and

742
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,520
goes to Z but it also goes to said plus

743
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,099
one that's down there or let's see I

744
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:10,560
think I don't see I think it's there so

745
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,180
it's set plus one which sort of

746
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,980
I think this is a program mistake I'm

747
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,800
not sure but it's sort of uh also

748
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,660
another indication that this was sort of

749
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,180
they went from from the this kind of

750
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,040
yeah we're going to take Ukraine within

751
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,540
a couple of days let's bring the big

752
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,640
guns the Hermetic wiper they're like oh

753
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,520
holy crap this is a war we don't have

754
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,960
any more cyber weapons let's create

755
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,599
something quickly and

756
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,220
and then sort of that's why we see

757
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,680
probably programming errors and this

758
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,079
kind of obfuscations things because

759
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:46,940
this was not prepared not playing around

760
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:50,640
uh and what it does this to wipe this

761
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,560
one they actually use this uh i o

762
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,480
control disk set Drive layout

763
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,660
functionality which is sort of it's a

764
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,640
portion manager but this one also sort

765
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,520
of wipes instead of you know portioning

766
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,800
it sort of gives you just you know trash

767
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,500
and back two but yes yeah so the

768
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,920
Ukrainian responds to this uh as I said

769
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,880
before the ukrainians have long

770
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,780
experience with dealing with Russian

771
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:26,220
cyber war and again as I said before one

772
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,140
of the things they learn is it's just

773
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:32,220
not enough to do your best to protect

774
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,280
your system you're gonna get breached

775
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,099
eventually anyway especially when you

776
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:40,859
have some really qualified data

777
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:42,540
activists after you

778
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:47,040
so a lot of the job is trying to

779
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,400
increase resilience

780
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,579
minimize the impact of the breach that's

781
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:55,859
bound to happen

782
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:59,060
one thing is I did it is that they have

783
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,980
segmented the networks they don't have

784
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,520
their whole electric grid in one network

785
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,280
they have several smaller networks so

786
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,599
that if one gets

787
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,900
breached they can only do local damage

788
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,200
by this time they had managed with help

789
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,480
from

790
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,040
allies

791
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:26,700
to get better detection capabilities and

792
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,180
they were quite very quickly discovered

793
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,940
when the Russians started move in the

794
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,040
system

795
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,480
and again

796
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,400
rapid response not just have a detection

797
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,579
but having people ready to go bam within

798
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:47,820
minutes of them receiving the warnings

799
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,900
the ukrainians rapid response were in

800
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,060
the network

801
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,859
isolating

802
00:37:54,859 --> 00:37:59,339
stopping and trying to kick out

803
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:02,160
and the result of this effort on their

804
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,900
page meant that

805
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,099
this attack actually didn't do all that

806
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:11,760
much damage there were localized power

807
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,780
outs in the few hours

808
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,000
and that's it

809
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,940
then the enemy was kicked out and then

810
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,240
they quickly restored from backups and

811
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,460
were up and running again

812
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,680
and I think that is

813
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,160
that is all uh one of the many lessons

814
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,160
of this cyber war that protection is

815
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,140
good

816
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:41,339
but for resilience be able to resist

817
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:43,680
this type of cyber War you also need

818
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,780
detection

819
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:50,400
and response to be able to go in quickly

820
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,680
kick them out because they're going to

821
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,760
get in

822
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,420
we all know who sit here know enough how

823
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,320
much

824
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,800
the technology today is stacked in the

825
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,579
attack of favor

826
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,119
yes so they're actually they use this uh

827
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,579
in uh

828
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:18,960
combination within Destroyer too which

829
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,540
was targeting targeting uh the energy

830
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,300
grid and yeah there's I don't have that

831
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,680
Insight but

832
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,839
whatever for what I know they actually

833
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,780
succeeded to run the end Destroyer uh

834
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,240
and take a limited power outage but

835
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,460
ukrainians are very resilient I mean

836
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,599
that's I think that's a big lessons

837
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:40,260
learned that restore very quickly and so

838
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,640
yeah that's that's a great good write-up

839
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,920
from from the Ukrainian search which I I

840
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,720
admire they do a fantastic job if

841
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,880
someone is here you know my Applause to

842

846
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,180
most clever guy I know uh he he did an

847
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,160
excellent write-up on and Destroyer too

848
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,740
and you can also download a pcap from

849
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:08,520
the in Destroyer to crappiness so if you

850
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,280
if you're like me or like Eric who loves

851
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,200
Bioshock and t-shark can you know well

852
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,940
that all that goodness in a peacap you

853
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,619
know you can download that and learn

854
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:20,520
from to you know protect ourselves

855
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,040
and then like sorry for a Shameless plug

856
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,320
I actually wrote A Blog about the the

857
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,780
the caddy Viper it's on the true SEC

858
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,820
homepage there's a reason why I'm doing

859
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,320
this is sort of it's not just to promote

860
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,460
myself the there's a genre rule I put in

861
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,420
there

862
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,720
and one of the things I like to do when

863
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,720
as a malware analyst is try to use

864
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,740
the bad guys stuff against themselves so

865
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,800
in this case they actually they used

866
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,920
stacked strings to access

867
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,920
the rower hard drive disk which is like

868
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,920
uh if you're a legit program that

869
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,660
doesn't make sense why are you hiding

870
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:04,440
that API call to the raw disk so if we

871
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,320
sort of uh if you put this sort of this

872
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,380
op code into cyber Chef you can see that

873
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,560
accessing the raw disk and if we put

874
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,740
this into a yellow roof looks like this

875
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,540
looks like a lot of lot of op codes but

876
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,300
this is sort of this is accessing raw

877
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,859
disk with stack strings and yeah I know

878
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,180
this actually has been run on some some

879
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,940
garments actually so for protection but

880
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,099
sort of yeah used they're trying to hide

881
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:34,020
but by by hiding you know they become

882
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,000
more visible so hunt for that kind of

883
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,359
behavior because that sort of a big way

884
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,280
of finding let's say threat hunting and

885
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,500
finding what the bad stuff they're doing

886
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,660
sort of

887
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,839
foreign

888
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,880
just to finalize and

889
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,220
go a little bit beyond the original

890
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,619
we're also going to talk a little bit

891
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:03,960
about uh the Russian hacktivism that's

892
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,720
been directed both at Ukraine

893
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,480
and

894
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,119
other countries like neighboring

895
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:15,079
countries and so on

896
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:18,060
and the title money and Mother Russia

897
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:22,920
means that as you will did know

898
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,940
um this is uh as much for money and fame

899
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:30,740
as for patriotism really

900
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:33,960
we picked just one of them there are so

901
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,060
many that picture one on random the

902
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:40,140
August 17th DDOS attack against Estonia

903
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:44,280
um partly because Estonia has been

904
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,099
one of the first recipients of big DDOS

905
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:50,099
attacked back in order in 2007.

906
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:53,339
so they have proper defenses and

907
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:56,220
didn't really happen

908
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,480
excuse me

909
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,920
the threat actor was one of the largest

910
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,300
Russian hacktivist gangs called killnet

911
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,740
cool

912
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,800
targeting Estonian government websites

913
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,140
some banks or some other things

914
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:18,720
the tools killnet uses is the their own

915
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,260
version of the Mirai botnet it's an iot

916
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:27,240
botnet Capital producing L4 L7 DDOS not

917
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,260
much to say there except the fact that

918
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:31,859
um

919
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,099
modern DDOS protection is not DDOS

920
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:37,760
protection unless you also have L7

921
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,099
defenses because every serious attack

922
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:46,740
these days to L7 IE HTTP based so just

923
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,980
just protection from sin flooding is not

924
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,319
enough anymore

925
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,980
objective I would say infinite Fame and

926
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,540
donations

927
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,380
this is kilnet's telegram Channel where

928
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,220
they solicit donations from their fans

929
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:08,720
in Bitcoins Monero

930
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,760
so who are killnet

931
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,640
they actually started out as a criminal

932
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,440
deidos botnet

933
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:19,560
in January the month before the war

934
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,140
started they launched

935
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,839
um a darknic page offering their

936
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:28,980
services to sell didos attacks or you

937
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,280
could rent their botnet for DDOS attacks

938
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,859
and pay money for them

939
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:36,180
but

940
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:41,099
After the War Began they switched and

941
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:44,220
became hacktivists they realized that

942
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,220
there was a pretty good gig here what

943
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:51,540
you do is you start ddosing someone and

944
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:54,900
says oh we are the cybers BET snots of

945
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,839
Russia see there and then you screenshot

946
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,760
that you know

947
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,000
Lockheed Martin's home page is down see

948
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,339
we hacked Lockheed Martin hey they make

949
00:45:05,339 --> 00:45:09,920
the F-35 fighter look how awesome we are

950
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:15,900
works because the media buys it how many

951
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,079
times have we read that the media says

952
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:21,660
ooh Cyber attack this and then and it's

953
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:25,079
a DDOS attack and yeah I mean annoying

954
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:27,900
home page is down for

955
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,140
half an hour and then it's up again

956
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:33,180
nothing's damaged behind that but they

957
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,119
managed to recruit around

958
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:40,200
140 people who are volunteers

959
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,800
working for them using their you can see

960
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,260
the the

961
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:50,000
even have a a

962
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:53,420
smartphone app you can use for

963
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:57,000
controlling DDOS attacks divide them

964
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,420
into squads use kind of semi-military

965
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,040
language to sound even cooler

966
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,760
um their leader has their initial

967
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,540
founder and leader has been

968
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:14,520
Talks by now that's the dude over there

969
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,260
in the corner

970
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,680
looks very much like his pet snots

971
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,180
um

972
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,960
there's cyber criminals turn Patriots

973
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,300
well yeah maybe

974
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,640
see I'm I haven't quite been up my mind

975
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,760
now whether this is actually should fall

976
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,780
under hacktivism or cyber fraud because

977
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:39,300
obviously they're using they're doing

978
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,119
these attacks and they know they have to

979
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:44,040
be smart enough to know that they're not

980
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,680
really doing anything they just garnish

981
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,940
Fame by doing pretty pointless attacks

982
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,760
not not even trying I mean if it's if

983
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,060
it's real state sponsored actor was

984
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,240
being smart about using DDOS as a weapon

985
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,240
to try and Services they could

986
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,180
probably do a lot of damage

987
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,760
but these guys they don't they they

988
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,280
don't care they just want the screenshot

989
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,020
hey it's down we hacked them raw raw us

990
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:18,060
donate money

991
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:21,000
and we know that they have gotten tens

992
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,700
of thousands of dollars in donations

993
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,440
from fans

994
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,960
so this is

995
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,760
crowd-funded hacktivism

996
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,980
and I said you know you could probably

997
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,020
look at it as a form of cyber fraud too

998
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,940
because these people probably think that

999
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:39,740
they give money for a worthy course

1000
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:48,599
so some final conclusions up at the top

1001
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,220
there

1002
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:53,819
we have the timeline first Russia

1003
00:47:53,819 --> 00:47:57,000
prepare for the invasion execute the

1004
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,940
invasion they're forced to retreat and

1005
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:03,000
forced into a war they were not prepared

1006
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,300
for

1007
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:09,020
we have a number of cyber attacks

1008
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,099
whisper gate

1009
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:15,780
during the preparation phase trying to

1010
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,480
undermine Ukraine's morale

1011
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,599
we have the day of the invasion where

1012
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,619
cyber attacks a time to coincide with a

1013
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:27,960
battle plan that's been

1014
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,680
agreed in advance planned in detail

1015
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,839
except

1016
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:36,720
doesn't quite work because the

1017
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,180
ukrainians are simply too resilient and

1018
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,920
too resourceful

1019
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,140
and then you have a third

1020
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:46,140
when the war on the ground has failed

1021
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:49,920
they have to rethink and plan B Plan B

1022
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,300
fast

1023
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,119
and that the same thing that happens in

1024
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:57,060
the Cyber War you have the caddy wiper a

1025
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,040
much less

1026
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,160
smartly prepared

1027
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,819
cyber weapon than the Hermetic wiper

1028
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:08,400
and as backgrounds you have the

1029
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,720
hacktivists

1030
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,760
and that is important because that is

1031
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,579
another list it's probably obvious to

1032
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:16,460
most people who

1033
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:19,980
knows about hacking that perhaps not

1034
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,319
always obvious in the political sense

1035
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:27,060
that a cyber weapon is not a cannon

1036
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:30,900
you can't fire gun boom boom boom a

1037
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,720
cyber weapon is a rocket you build a

1038
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,420
rocket you fire it and you hope it does

1039
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,680
damage

1040
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,380
but then everybody

1041
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:42,119
immediately start building signatories

1042
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:45,119
detection and so on and if you use the

1043
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,819
same weapon again it will be much less

1044
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:51,599
effective you have to build a new rocket

1045
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:56,099
and that second rocket was built in with

1046
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:58,079
much greater haste

1047
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,839
and it wasn't as qualified

1048
00:50:00,839 --> 00:50:03,420
and the ukrainians managed to stop it

1049
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:08,780
much more efficiently than the first one

1050
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,880
that

1051
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,380
is

1052
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,859
the end except

1053
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:22,260
um I would personally like to dedicate

1054
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,060
this

1055
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:24,900
um

1056
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:29,640
presentation to the brave Defenders of

1057
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,000
Ukrainian cyberspace and their leader

1058
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,540
our friend Victor Jora thank you thank

1059
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,720
you

1060
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,040
yeah thank you Matthias Nicholas um

1061
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,420
what I was thinking I mean first of all

1062
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,040
they're clearly they are doing a good

1063
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,400
job fending off these attacks then so

1064
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,040
uh is your primary source for the

1065
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,900
binaries and stuff is that from Cirque

1066
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,180
Dua or is there better sources for

1067
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,700
people who want to dig through this it's

1068
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:05,160
a combo but yeah now they are all three

1069
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,380
wipers are available at uh malware

1070
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:10,559
Bazaar so I can if everyone is

1071
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,059
interested you know I can I can point

1072
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:14,040
them in that direction all right and for

1073
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,839
other information I mean is this a

1074
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,760
primary source of information also the

1075
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,339
Circ UA for when stuff happened and what

1076
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:22,319
was the response and how long it took or

1077
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:24,660
do you have friends there well it's it's

1078
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:27,839
a combo I mean it's a combo some of it

1079
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:31,400
is open source uh some of it yeah we had

1080
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,720
uh certain uas uh Victor shora visiting

1081
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:40,319
uh Sweden and talking to True SEC so we

1082
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:41,700
had a little bit of Ironside information

1083
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,579
there but again because Aura has all

1084
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:47,220
since then also given uh interviews

1085
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:50,460
openly so it's a lot of different

1086
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,859
information bringing together now it

1087
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,119
looks like you're okay are you getting

1088
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:56,359
your fingers dirty helping out as well

1089
00:51:56,359 --> 00:52:01,619
uh awesome okay all right interesting

1090
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:04,500
um okay we have some intelligent and

1091
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,240
some non-intelligent questions from the

1092
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,500
audience

1093
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,380
um so I'm gonna I'm gonna start with an

1094
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:13,260
intelligent uh question which is do you

1095
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,540
think it actually had an impact and

1096
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,160
would it have changed if the satellites

1097
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,740
weren't attacked did actually well this

1098
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,140
cyber warfare did it actually impact the

1099
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,859
war in general

1100
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:31,920
um he I would say yes it did I think it

1101
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,059
established the fact that cyber is now

1102
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:40,380
a part of Modern Warfare now you can't

1103
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:43,020
say cyber warfare some people would say

1104
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,420
you know cyber warfare is everything you

1105
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:46,559
know you don't even have to send

1106
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,359
detained the tanks anymore you just

1107
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:50,280
press a button and turn everything off

1108
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,280
and boo you win that's not true that's

1109
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,200
not happening

1110
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,059
but you can't either say it doesn't

1111
00:52:57,059 --> 00:52:59,160
impact anything

1112
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,780
like

1113
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:01,579
um

1114
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:06,059
Ukraine managed to overcome

1115
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:08,579
the Russian attacks just like they

1116
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:10,559
managed to overcome I mean Russia

1117
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,839
managed to stop

1118
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,839
the tank rush to keep

1119
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,760
but you can't say that

1120
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,460
the Russian tanks moving over the Border

1121
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,619
didn't have an impact on the war of

1122
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:25,740
course it did just because it didn't

1123
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,380
ultimately succeed of course it had an

1124
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,740
impact

1125
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:33,720
okay that that makes sense uh the next

1126
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,180
question which is really relevant you

1127
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,280
talk about all these apts but but what

1128
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,920
about the deliver mechanisms how does

1129
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,140
that work in this case in in this case

1130
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,839
what was the normal delivery of all

1131
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,579
these apds

1132
00:53:47,579 --> 00:53:50,760
um I would say that from my perspective

1133
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,420
as Nicholas already mentioned a lot of

1134
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,740
it is

1135
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,020
they had pre-planned of course they had

1136
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,920
access uh we don't know exactly what

1137
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,619
access but it's the standard ones uh

1138
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:06,240
either you you manage to steal

1139
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,859
credentials or you'll find a

1140
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:10,140
vulnerability and you you have a back

1141
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:11,540
door in

1142
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:14,720
uh and then it is

1143
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,280
standard

1144
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,460
ransomware 101 privilege speculation

1145
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:23,760
take over the active directory a use

1146
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,880
group polishes and boom you're out

1147
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,220
okay another good question actually

1148
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,079
which is who comes up with these really

1149
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:34,020
cool names uh for all these apt groups

1150
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,599
and and the malware exploits and what

1151
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:38,460
happens if the APD group is not happy if

1152
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:41,460
they're like cuddly bear examples so can

1153
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,440
you apply for a new name and how does

1154
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,619
that work basically

1155
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:51,800
the major mostly American

1156
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,839
threat intelligence companies crowd

1157
00:54:54,839 --> 00:54:58,099
strike fire eye and so on they all have

1158
00:54:58,099 --> 00:55:02,520
their own uh naming convention one of

1159
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:06,260
them for example is the animals

1160
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:10,400
bear means Russian Panda means Chinese

1161
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,200
kitten means Iranian and so on

1162
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,780
that's true so you can say yeah fancy

1163
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,780
Bear yeah that's Russia

1164
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,780
uh and others use the APT one two three

1165
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:32,220
four five and up uh Microsoft uses

1166
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,000
um the um

1167
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,339
the uh elements like oxy and nitrogen

1168
00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:41,960
helium blah blah blah

1169
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:45,540
and they all use their own and nobody

1170
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:48,119
everybody agrees that it's stupid where

1171
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:50,640
they have five different names for the

1172
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,640
same thing but nobody wants to uh give

1173
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,559
up their own system but I would say

1174
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:58,200
that's like for the for the malware I I

1175
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,540
would say like okay I'm a blue team I'm

1176
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,579
super duper blue uh

1177
00:56:02,579 --> 00:56:04,260
I would like them to give a ridiculous

1178
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,359
name because you know these are

1179
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:09,119
so we shouldn't embrace them I mean we

1180
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,920
should just ridicule them because they

1181
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,380
are very bad people doing bad stuff so

1182
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,300
that's that's my opinion anyways they

1183
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,220
just rename the gold one yeah

1184
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:20,280
crap crap crap why we want crap Retreat

1185
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,260
so yeah that's not that through the

1186
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:25,980
convention yeah I'll get recorded code

1187
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,920
but yeah so you have to be here

1188
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,760
the gru unit

1189
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,800
74455 that is what the Russians call

1190
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,800
their own cyber warfare unit so but we

1191
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,900
don't know the size of the unit main

1192
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,280
Center for special technology or some

1193
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,900
non-descriptive thing we don't don't

1194
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,760
know the size of that unit

1195
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,339
uh

1196
00:56:50,339 --> 00:56:52,200
uh well

1197
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,319
not that I can say but I would I would

1198
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:57,900
say if there are in I would guess that

1199
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,280
there are

1200
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:04,319
well somewhere between 100 and 400 Maybe

1201
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,240
okay thank you very much do you have any

1202
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,819
more uh questions from the audience let

1203
00:57:08,819 --> 00:57:11,779
me come with a mic

1204
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:18,900
so let's say I'm a threat actor and I

1205
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,300
really want to obfuscate my code

1206
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:24,440
uh how good this obfuscation in 2022

1207
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,780
like is can you always beat the

1208
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:30,380
obfuscation

1209
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,520
uh eventually yes I mean it's usually a

1210
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,319
matter of time I mean that's

1211
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:38,160
so many ways of obfuscation I mean it's

1212
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,220
at runtime you you you populate it you

1213
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:43,800
use different kind of Packers or

1214
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,319
compression or you know there's loads

1215
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:49,680
and loads away so yes you can but I mean

1216
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,280
usually the blue team wins in the end

1217
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,680
I would say also like I was a little

1218
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,119
shout out we have like a war room down

1219
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,000
there and some of the stuff we talked

1220
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,920
about might be valuable for the tech

1221
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,839
Geeks to you know just have a look there

1222
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,540
I just say sorry for the pitch

1223
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:09,059
hi uh regarding this hermetic wiper

1224
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:12,859
right you told uh it is using defragment

1225
00:58:12,859 --> 00:58:16,319
and also using MBR it is infecting it

1226
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:17,240
right

1227
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,800
MBR and uh

1228
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,800
diffract command yeah on harmonic weapon

1229
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,660
right

1230
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:26,400
but don't you think that is for old hard

1231
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,579
drive not for the SSD or GPT partition

1232
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:32,460
right GPT partition yeah it is

1233
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:35,460
protective MBR do you think some motive

1234
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:38,880
is there to use hermetic wiper for the

1235
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,640
old hard drive not new hard drive it

1236
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,559
might be because it had actually it has

1237
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:46,500
even a like a XP driver that is utilized

1238
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:49,319
so it had this kind of checks what

1239
00:58:49,319 --> 00:58:51,000
operating system am I on like before

1240
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,040
they use the driver all the way back to

1241
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,160
to XP computers so so that there was

1242
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,799
some indication that yeah

1243
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:02,099
did I answer the question correctly or

1244
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:03,720
yeah okay cool

1245
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:07,440
okay uh then thank you very much and uh

1246
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,460
we are ready for lunch and lunch is

1247
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,839
being served wait
