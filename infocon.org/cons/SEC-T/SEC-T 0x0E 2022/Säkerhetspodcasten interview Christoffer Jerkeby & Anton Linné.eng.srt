1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,280
hi so we're here at the SEC T at the

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,800
community part of the the conference and

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,719
we're here with Anton and Christopher

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,420
who just gave us the the last talk for

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,420
the evening and it was quite a bombshell

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,779
all right thank you

7
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:23,460
last but not least last but not least

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,980
that's for sure yeah sure yeah well it's

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,460
pretty cool like are you you sort of

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:32,579
introduced a new bunk class but at the

11
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,620
same time not really introduced but sort

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,219
of showcased a method of sort of shaming

13
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,520
a bunch of already known classes can we

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,500
just do like a short excerpt for those

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,360
who didn't watch the talk of the stream

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,600
it's super short elevator pitch yeah

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,840
elevator pitch well you're able to uh

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,600
assert a lot of bad stuff into something

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,840
you think is good yeah yeah and this is

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,620
about JavaScript we're talking yeah and

21
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,420
JavaScript tend to have methods for

22
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,099
input validation that we think we can

23
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,799
bypass yeah that's a good gist of it

24
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,720
right yeah yeah so

25
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,299
um we were looking at like obviously you

26
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,040
guys are you I think you did a really

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,360
nice like

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,640
pretty like ah this is not that bad it's

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,100
like you had a pretty like

30
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,740
a nice way like a cool attitude of

31
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,960
addressing it and I don't really think

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,000
that everyone actually got that it's

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,740
this could potentially be really really

34
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,060
bad uh yeah you had some like you did

35
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,659
your move the famous move right yeah

36
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:37,579
yeah

37
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:40,920
which is pretty cool it's uh yes maybe

38
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,380
it's a bigger thing that I mean uh for

39
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,180
me since we we've been working on this

40
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,840
over a year yeah for us it's not like we

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,460
we've been through this so many times

42
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,640
now yeah yeah uh and then I mean at

43
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,280
first uh during the research we we

44
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,259
actually didn't find any res other

45
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,320
research on this for almost a year so we

46
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,420
thought like this is this is something

47
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,479
really new and then just maybe I'm like

48
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,520
a couple of weeks ago where we found out

49
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,560
that there was more there was more there

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,300
was something on this that we hadn't

51
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,520
found and I mean that's an issue itself

52
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,860
because I we found something and there

53
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,680
we couldn't find any research about it

54
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,680
so it was something but then we also

55
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,080
realized well it was I mean it wasn't

56
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,599
that Downer but it was more like oh

57
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,640
we yeah right now there's some other

58
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,379
research on this that we trying to

59
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,120
introduce is something completely new

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,580
because it's not like completely new

61
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,379
it's just that nobody knows about it

62
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,180
yeah but being in the field of security

63
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,280
you have to be sort of humble right sure

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,280
if you walk in and you yourself Define

65
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,040
that this bug class is the bomb this is

66
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,140
the worst thing that can happen and it

67
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,700
turns out that you're wrong you're gonna

68
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,620
gotta get a lot of flash because you

69
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,480
cannot exaggerate these things and

70
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,340
that's dangerous as well like that would

71
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,959
not be inclusive they're in the

72
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,519
community right right so if you dictate

73
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,900
the terms of something that you don't

74
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,180
really know yeah that will backlash we

75
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,760
didn't have much to back down on until a

76
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,500
few weeks back when we find found that

77
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,660
other reach the research by Aaron hammer

78
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,780
and he said this is devastating yeah and

79
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,360
then uh when we started posting

80
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,220
pre-posting saying that okay this is

81
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,500
coming up on SEC t on Twitter there was

82
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,300
people replying is this the same thing

83
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,040
as this research and we're like what's

84
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,319
that research

85
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,640
so you actually got valid input from

86
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,280
that yeah yeah it wasn't Associated to

87
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,260
the topic or was it completely different

88
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,140
yeah so we talked about

89
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,180
a bug class today that's called HPA

90
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,120
that's uh hidden property abuse that bug

91
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,239
class was presented in 2020 I think at

92
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,440
black hat

93
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,720
but the guy who runs that Twitter

94
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,159
account and he's been pushing that

95
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,599
research hasn't got a lot of attention

96
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,879
for it but that's so we had missed it

97
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,099
completely but that bug class have

98
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,440
almost identical type of attacks around

99
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,620
it as to answer and that was inspiring

100
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,720
us to be able to start defining how bad

101
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,040
can it get

102
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,840
but I have to ask

103
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,480
because this is you spent a year on this

104
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,840
yeah how did it start no but I have to

105
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,760
stop we have to we have to we have to we

106
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,680
have the day deeper

107
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,798
having focused for a year yeah with no

108
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,918
Google results yeah and just like a

109
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,720
couple of Frameworks so how did it start

110
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,400
like you you mentioned you did a black

111
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,620
box thing you found something you called

112
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,620
The Wizard of JavaScript

113
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,120
looked at it and you sort of combined

114
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,759
forces like this is bad but

115
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,100
you didn't have that much to go on right

116
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,040
yeah yeah like you you reached out and

117
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,620
you said like um this must be something

118
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,699
right yeah like yeah this this

119
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:45,780
yeah exactly this has to be something

120
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,440
right and I said like no it's it's not

121
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,300
and I mean even though we've been

122
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,520
working on this for for a year we

123
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,199
haven't been uh dedicated 100 already

124
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,780
yeah but it was it was like uh like

125
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,759
searching for because everything ended

126
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,919
up in what's called prototype pollution

127
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:07,740
which is a different thing yeah it's not

128
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,740
the same thing at all no and uh that's I

129
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,960
mean that's how it all started we tried

130
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,360
to do prototype illusion and I was like

131
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,259
I was we wanted to yeah to do it and I

132
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,540
was I didn't understand I was like I'm

133
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,759
doing everything right this should work

134
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,620
yeah and it's not working what the hell

135
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,500
yeah okay yeah okay yeah then you can

136
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,940
yeah so

137
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,759
you try like just to to jump it down I

138
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,800
guess like so you're trying one attack

139
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,500
record like one concept of an attack and

140
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,360
it's failing but it shouldn't be failing

141
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,460
actually and then you store that that

142
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,199
will be like the rabbit hole then so

143
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,180
that's where you dig deeper and sort of

144
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,699
came to the conclusion that Holy

145
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,759
something this is something else yeah

146
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,520
and the funny thing that I find really

147
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,160
really weird is that we found this in in

148
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,500
a package called Joey we found this in

149
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,419
that package it's in a lot of other

150
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,280
packages like we confirmed a bunch of

151
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,220
others too but it all started with joy

152
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,720
for the other researchers as well when

153
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,639
we found other researchers they also

154
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,340
found exactly that bug too like in 2019

155
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,620
that's interesting I think it's a

156
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,419
problem because it's a very famous

157
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:16,340
Library

158
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,720
yeah that's the one you use and it

159
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,039
should so it's supposed to be and

160
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,780
everyone's everything everyone thinks

161
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,520
it's secure I mean it has The

162
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,979
credibility of of this guy Aaron Hammer

163
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,020
who did a lot of research on it and they

164
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,160
don't mention this vulnerability

165
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,440
anywhere on site they don't have any

166
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,240
recommendations to how to really use it

167
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,400
to avoid vulnerability and that means

168
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,080
that everyone's doing it wrong yeah yeah

169
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,660
and I think I mean it's it's sad that

170
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,639
when you uh when you check the package I

171
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,199
mean the the joy package doesn't have

172
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,440
any vulnerabilities at all

173
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,759
that's weird though yes it's really

174
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,680
weird so they that I mean they they

175
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,539
found the vulnerabilities and they just

176
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:54,020
said no

177
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,100
we're not going to do anything about

178
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,780
that it's not going to be reported

179
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,160
anywhere and people don't know about

180
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,580
this yes they confirmly and I mean yeah

181
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,440
so

182
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,479
um and yeah that was just the start of

183
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,539
the rabbit hole um have you maybe you

184
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:11,160
don't want to answer this but you yeah

185
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,960
I'm gonna ask it anyways have you tried

186
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,100
to just

187
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,560
like my idea is like

188
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,380
shoot and automate everything and just

189
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,000
shoot wherever and see what would you

190
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,460
get back yeah I guess like for fun it's

191
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,780
a relevant question and that's a

192
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,919
question that a lot of people are asking

193
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,599
and I know that others have we've been

194
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,639
asking about the people selectively yeah

195
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,259
to investigate this and they found

196
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,599
practically nothing because random brute

197
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,340
forcing doesn't get too much very far

198
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,080
okay so you have to you have to have the

199
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,460
source code you don't need to know what

200
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,780
you're exploiting so you need to be

201
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,099
aware of the application because you

202
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:42,860
need to know what prototype to replace

203
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,840
but however there are yeah sure because

204
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,580
it's yeah okay yeah but then you have

205
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,520
like the the common Keys like try with

206
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,500
e-balk uh like uh command CMD like the

207
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,020
so you could kind of Brute Force this as

208
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,419
well uh we haven't drilled it on that no

209
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:04,259
no no yeah there is like there is like

210
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,080
it's the request way like like sending a

211
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,460
request back and forth the other way is

212
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,819
to blindly just recursively look through

213
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,280
repositories looking for like a sink

214
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,380
yeah because that that could be like two

215
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,360
string for example for example like you

216
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,220
can yeah that could be a thing yeah

217
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,900
maybe you could automate pretty quickly

218
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,300
so we wrote a blog post about how we

219
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,520
would go about to do that okay yeah that

220
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,199
we published today and in that blog post

221
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,879
we mentioned that right please find the

222
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,880
blog uh on my website jacob.sc come on

223
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,260
Boom yep

224
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,899
so if you go there there is examples of

225
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,458
things that you could search for in code

226
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,640
ql for instance a sync defined to go for

227
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,860
these are the inputs and these are these

228
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,480
are the sources

229
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,580
cool eh yeah because that that like for

230
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,200
the bug Bounty community that would be

231
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,760
pretty nice yeah this is this is what

232
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,320
you need and if you have code assisted

233
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,959
Scopes though yeah it's yeah

234
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,200
um but you if you do have a few exploits

235
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,720
that you have found using code scanning

236
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,580
you can blindly search for those

237
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,740
exploits in applications that seems to

238
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,080
be using those libraries oh yeah sure

239
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,420
because yeah it's because you have a

240
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,440
reference yeah

241
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,240
so then then you can then you can just

242
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,240
do this with the unknown Mass everywhere

243
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,680
that's pretty cool that's pretty cool

244
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,440
yeah so for example in in the Qs Library

245
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,779
the crazy Library I mean the fixed

246
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,000
protocols yesterday in February yeah

247
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,459
this year not everyone's patched no no

248
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,200
no of course not so that that's of

249
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,240
course something you uh you would search

250
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,640
for like yeah the previous version of

251
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,040
the package yeah uh it's pretty cool

252
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,320
yeah I feel like I should mention that

253
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,660
in HPA there is in that research if you

254
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,779
go and look for the paper called a

255
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,899
hidden property abuse there is a tool

256
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:49,860
and that tool has have made a a scanning

257
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,600
engine for scanning code with symbolic

258
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,339
execution where you can scan okay

259
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,560
behavior in JavaScript I would indicate

260
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,560
that you can overwrite

261
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,060
values in properties it doesn't go for

262
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,060
for for

263
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,200
Prototype poisoning because he wasn't

264
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,860
aware of that at the time but we got in

265
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,360
touch with him recently and maybe that's

266
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,860
a feature that could be added to that

267
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,300
tool so we could have a combine make

268
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,880
sense search for all three of these bug

269
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,100
classes or maybe do it in cold curl

270
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,420
potentially I mean this is the

271
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,399
conceptual thing now the thing is when I

272
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,140
look at you you did like this graph

273
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,940
where you sort of we're here now like

274
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,820
this roadmap thing uh I'm not really

275
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,279
sure how it's different yet for the

276
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,019
class classes that you mentioned I don't

277
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:33,779
like I know the idea of it yeah but I

278
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,420
can grasp the concept how it's different

279
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,660
uh I mean everything goes it's just like

280
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,760
a flavor yeah everything goes yeah it's

281
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,320
kind of this how are you send in the

282
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,600
input yeah so the input object let's say

283
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,760
the input object is always Json yeah or

284
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,399
not yeah I could well for the sake of

285
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,220
this it always is so in our case we are

286
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,380
writing the word Proto and setting the

287
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,240
proton we're setting its members that's

288
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,100
what you do in poisoning and that means

289
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,519
that you will set it in run time uh it

290
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,980
will be certainly run time in Prototype

291
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,680
pollution uh it's set in a different way

292
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,160
where you have different variables where

293
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,160
you have to be very lucky frankly to

294
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,200
find three different variables or three

295
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,120
different levels of variables and and

296
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,160
replace those with Proto and the name or

297
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,079
double Pro to if you want to go higher

298
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,120
in the hierarchy and and the value of

299
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,339
what you want to poison it with and in

300
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,980
the last case with HPA you don't bother

301
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,440
with prototypes at all you simply just

302
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,540
type in the thing you want inside of the

303
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,339
inputs you have username password and

304
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:38,760
then debug so you know and uh that

305
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,399
seemed to work uh well as well for for

306
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,079
the people behind that research so

307
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,760
they're doing things like searching for

308
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,000
underscore ID or Constructor colon name

309
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,680
that seems to be things that makes

310
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,839
things crash so yeah so that that's

311
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,160
probably the same thing you can do here

312
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,380
but you put it in the the Proto yeah

313
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,260
Proto object instead yeah because that

314
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,540
that should possibly work that's pretty

315
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,459
cool how does this feel though like

316
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,240
exactly yeah

317
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,980
Frontier opening up really I mean we

318
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,740
we're recently realized that you can

319
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,540
combine these three bug classes like

320
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,940
three musketeers of the pain really

321
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,040
because that means that you can change

322
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,019
the control flow in different places in

323
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,240
the application could potentially be

324
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,820
really impactful like I've known this

325
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,120
for

326
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,019
and I sort of like hmm this is like I

327
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,459
don't want to give you like all the

328
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,560
credits and all the balloons and Glory

329
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,779
but it looks pretty solid and it looks

330
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:39,540
like how has that this not been detected

331
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,640
before looks like why it could be nasty

332
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,220
no but why is that JavaScript is

333
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,839
everywhere why

334
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,540
I think there is one thing that we need

335
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,339
to talk about and that's the fact that

336
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,200
there was a prototype poisoning sure

337
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,899
reports in 2018 that never went public

338
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,660
because they were going towards uh the

339
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,560
node.js bug Bounty program and they paid

340
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,540
for having those reports not disclosed

341
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,959
okay and that that's shitty yeah so it's

342
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,180
just uh it's a the language is broken

343
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,399
that that's also what what uh Aaron

344
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,200
Hammer said like the the language is

345
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,480
kind of broken it's it's just the way it

346
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,180
is yeah yeah but sure we have said that

347
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,100
about cross-site scripting and then the

348
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,860
like like whatever right so we have but

349
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,300
it's like

350
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,240
there's probably a way I guess yeah sure

351
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,120
yeah I I think that was the thing I

352
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,260
mentioned about the back Bounty I don't

353
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,360
want to blame

354
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,740
that could be a reason for sure

355
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,899
go about this in a more sort of Academic

356
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,180
Way and actually document this bug class

357
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,459
properly that would mean that others

358
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:42,720
could search for it to find the

359
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,220
information for us it was pretty hard

360
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,360
because people were using the wrong

361
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,399
names uh all the time a lot a lot of

362
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,100
times when people do prototype poisoning

363
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,540
they write prototype pollution because

364
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,160
they don't know that poisoning exists or

365
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,959
what the difference is no because that's

366
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,420
my idea now from like just a grasp of it

367
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,620
I don't really know the difference and

368
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,260
that's I think I'm not alone in that I

369
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,399
think that's pretty common for everyone

370
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,300
yeah so we need maybe a good SEO and get

371
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,279
a lot of people to sort of get into this

372
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,320
and so yeah yeah so I think it makes a

373
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,880
lot of sense for you guys to sort of

374
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,920
we're here and we can so you sort of

375
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,320
dictate that we can shame these but they

376
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,240
are not the same yeah I think that is a

377
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,639
really good input for the presentation

378
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,820
of this class yeah uh in order to sort

379
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,000
of set the go read the the blog post

380
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,980
okay because we try to Define it and

381
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,899
distinguish it even though we realize

382
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:33,540
that it's very very hard to to get the

383
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,279
grasp anyway it's it's a load of text

384
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,560
frankly I mean it's hard for me to grasp

385
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,260
either one of these yeah and and seeing

386
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,360
presentations about it it's like you

387
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,680
have to understand the language you're

388
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,300
working with and that's not funny for a

389
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,000
pen tester no not at all no no no but

390
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,519
it's to be frank that's that's true

391
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,980
I want a tutorial I want an example yeah

392
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,899
and I want to make a proof of concept

393
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:56,940
quick eventually we'll get there there

394
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,519
will be there will be ways of doing this

395
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,800
quicker there will be pre-made exploits

396
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,779
probably around this that will make it

397
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,220
easier and there'll probably be much

398
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,839
better research the one with it but you

399
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,519
have to give like the foundational

400
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,980
research for a new bug class is always a

401
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,680
door opener into sure a Shane of things

402
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,420
that defines things more in stricter

403
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,720
ways so so where do you think will be in

404
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,360
like a year from now when it comes to

405
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,459
researching this hopefully we'll see a

406
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,820
lot more like reports and uh

407
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,459
like here for off prototype poisoning

408
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,920
and not just say that this is for

409
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,660
example prototype pollution when it's

410
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,880
not uh that's something I really want to

411
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,779
see like we're getting actually reports

412
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:42,060
you also to like make the the people

413
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,519
who's using enjoy aware that this

414
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,320
vulnerability exists if you don't fix it

415
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,839
it will it's it's gonna be there yeah uh

416
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:50,399
because right right now I mean the

417
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,139
latest version is still vulnerable yeah

418
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:53,820
and the documentation says nothing about

419
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,760
it no exactly so they have to have they

420
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,500
have the help right there I mean they

421
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,899
have written the library to help you

422
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,839
born that's there and you can use it but

423
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,579
they don't refer to it so it's not so

424
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,560
easy to find it it's not it was simple

425
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,720
patch but also combining these

426
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,579
vulnerabilities together like the even

427
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:12,899
though they're the kind of the same

428
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,180
stuff but they're not uh obviously it's

429
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,940
like setting up a CTF uh for this uh

430
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,639
before this presentation and I just took

431
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,100
a random Library uh which I just wanted

432
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,079
to like do some basic stuff with it and

433
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,360
I realized I both have

434
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,880
prototype poisoning and prototype

435
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,880
pollution in this application yeah so in

436
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,519
that case I mean uh you're using both I

437
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,699
haven't tried like the HPA yeah yeah but

438
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:41,180
they're probably something yeah

439
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,199
in the same

440
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,259
um in the same way so uh I think we'll

441
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,240
see hopefully we'll see like more

442
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,880
reports using these together because I

443
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,459
mean often the the product type

444
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,680
poisoning which we presented today is a

445
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,300
way in to get these other

446
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,160
vulnerabilities because you're like

447
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,980
you're you're sending in like keys that

448
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,060
shouldn't be there it's that little

449
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,099
wedge that you you know put in the

450
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,319
cracks yeah yeah but I think it's a it's

451
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,839
a it's a nice door opener yeah all

452
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,720
together I think that this is uh

453
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,740
I think I really prefer this kind of

454
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,480
disclosure of a class because it's like

455
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,000
it it is not common if you think about

456
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,359
it like this this is just my opinion but

457
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,939
it tends to be a lot of high horses that

458
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,439
needs to be ridden when you sort of

459
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,480
found something like this but then you

460
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,240
sort of I I really get that but that it

461
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,039
comes from experience I guess for you

462
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,260
guys that not claim anything that you

463
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,480
can't back up right now yeah and be

464
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,980
humble about the knowledge that you

465
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,440
actually gained about this which I think

466
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,059
is really aspiring which is really cool

467
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,039
no but it actually is yeah because you

468
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,179
tend to

469
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:51,299
I really like this kind of change in our

470
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,760
community because when I started I agree

471
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,400
it was really not uh we didn't include

472
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,799
anyone if you were in the league one so

473
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,360
you need to sort of earn your spot and

474
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,460
you're doing the complete opposite and

475
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,860
that is awesome sharing what you have

476
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,539
and I write but it needs to be said

477
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,160
because we have been talking about it we

478
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,840
have been talking about trying to be

479
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,299
part of that change and one part of it

480
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,039
is great I think it's awesome and you

481
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,480
should really hear that oh thank you

482
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,520
thank you and like sharing yeah this is

483
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,260
good yeah I mean sharing the knowledge

484
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,600
for free is one uh also having

485
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,900
references to our priors the people who

486
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,280
actually inspired us and that's

487
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,679
important as well yeah that's that's one

488
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,260
part of it and uh and trying to

489
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,000
contribute to the solution I know we

490
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,679
haven't done it much yet but we try to

491
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,840
