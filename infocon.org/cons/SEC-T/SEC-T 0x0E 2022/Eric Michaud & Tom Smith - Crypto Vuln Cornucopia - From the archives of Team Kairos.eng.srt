1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,880
so I want to say thank you to the SEC T

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,379
family and crew

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,300
um for hopefully making me look good but

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,679
hopefully I'll make them look great uh

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,660
by providing great research and content

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,199
but uh good afternoon everyone uh

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,359
thanks um let's just get this kick

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,279
started so

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,820
uh one note for the talk uh Tom Smith my

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,500
CTO and co-founder could not make it

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,199
today uh family stuff was going on so he

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,699
had to stay home in the states so it's

13
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,260
just gonna be me today so I know I've

14
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,399
heard that might be a problem because

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,780
they have like little bumpers on the

16
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,399
bottom of the video feed and they'll say

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,780
two names and it might drive them crazy

18
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,000
so I apologize up there

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,520
all right

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,820
so how many of you are focusing on the

21
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,620
security of blockchain cryptocurrency

22
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,460
web 3 are other topics around that

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,039
I I assumed is very little and that's

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,260
correct hopefully today after this you

25
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,480
might uh find some interest and start

26
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,039
um applying your skills from the

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,239
information security industry

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,620
vulnerability research industry over

29
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,840
here because the impacts we're finding

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,860
are

31
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,540
um you know directly correlated to

32
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,340
actual material loss not like you lost

33
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,840
your photos or you know what is the

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,939
database worth of a customers names and

35
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,600
credit cards but actual cash so this is

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,560
a sample of exploits we developed at my

37
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,180
company where I'm a co-founder of

38
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,280
unciphered where we exclusively focus on

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,340
cryptocurrency Rescue and Recovery

40
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,400
um so anyway let's get started so my

41
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,100
name is Eric Michelle I previously spoke

42
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,259
at SEC T before I gave a talk on

43
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,360
exploiting um hidden service addresses

44
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,520
on tour how to enumerate all of them

45
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,960
um years ago but it was an unrecorded

46
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,880
talk because we were worried about

47
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,560
showing you know how it all works so

48
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,299
this will be my first recorded SEC T

49
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,000
talk so hopefully it goes really well

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,220
um a little bit more background

51
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,299
um I'm the

52
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,000
uh one of the co-founders of tool Us in

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,500
o4

54
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,780
um worked at Argonne National Laboratory

55
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,600
my first job and last W-2 job out of

56
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,280
college for three years I was in nuclear

57
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,439
engineering I had a communication arts

58
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,840
degree and a failing GPA and everyone

59
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,940
had a PhD in physics but I was on the

60
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,619
vulnerability assessment team we got to

61
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,260
hack tempor evident devices voting

62
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,319
machines lock stuff before that I had

63
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,239
invented an attack for the Medico M3

64
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,860
multi-lock interactive at the time so

65
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,900
that was publicly never done I was the

66
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,340
first and they thought that was cool so

67
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,739
learned a lot there

68
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:28,200
um I also co-founded the hackerspace I

69
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,180
founded the hackerspace computation won

70
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,099
one of the largest in the US now 12

71
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:33,420
years later it's still going I didn't

72
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,440
realize

73
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,360
um and Rift Recon

74
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,440
um there's a few other things in between

75
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,180
but refereecon was a for eight years

76
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,480
from 2012 to 2020 a full offense red

77
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,099
teaming Products company for the most

78
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,319
part I found red teaming for physical

79
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,260
for Consulting wasn't so good unless

80
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,959
you're doing web app pens so

81
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,340
um also I completed my first ultra

82
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,140
marathon at Burning Man uh the other

83
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,120
week uh 50 kilometers and I'm looking

84
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,379
for the next challenge so if anyone here

85
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,360
is uh going into Ultra marathons or

86
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,459
already doing them hit me up afterwards

87
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,260
I'd love to talk more and I recently

88
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,879
just got inducted to the macgyvers union

89
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,400
and a member of 554.

90
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,360
um if you don't know what that is

91
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,620
finally after I think all of you can

92
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,060
apply and get in

93
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,900
um Tom Smith my CTO uh 20 years doing uh

94
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,640
high performance Computing fpga

95
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,860
development and uh glitching attacks

96
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,819
actually a whole slew of different

97
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:21,959
things

98
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,819
um but really who is in Seifert and so

99
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:25,200
it's really an amalgamation of people

100
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,180
I'm just representing like one only one

101
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,980
attack was really mine in the next four

102
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,480
we're going to cover

103
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,280
um it takes a whole village to make all

104
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,540
this happen in a whole lot of different

105
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,560
disciplines

106
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,560
team Kairos is our engineering team uh I

107
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,060
mean I'm one of the members but really

108
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,099
there's cryptanalysts Hardware hackers

109
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,599
and a whole slew of different talent and

110
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,220
people there that where most of this

111
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,319
work actually came from and uh recently

112
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,540
we founded team goo Liquors which is

113
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,519
actually an anagram of CoreLogic and we

114
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:52,799
won first place in the street division

115
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,360
at the Defcon password cracking

116
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,340
challenge with three three team members

117
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,799
technically two and a half Zonk was also

118
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,060
working on the tele challenge so it

119
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,560
really wasn't paying attention but we

120
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,640
did pretty good

121
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,560
so we look at ourselves as the World's

122
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,480
First Institutional cryptocurrency

123
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,760
rescue and Recovery company and what do

124
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,560
I mean by that there's a lot of people

125
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,420
out there who crack wallets in different

126
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,819
ways I was doing on the side on of Rift

127
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,820
for a few years but February last year

128
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,079
um I talked to my CTO about a hardware

129
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,600
wallet he said I fixed it after two

130
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,220
weeks I'm like what do you mean like I

131
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,220
saw the attack on Kraken blog and 50 of

132
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,680
the time it wipes out the crypto and

133
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,000
that attack stopped working after a

134
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,759
patch a few years ago so we've

135
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,820
modernized modernized it made 100 uh

136
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,259
reliable and we moved on to other

137
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,120
devices in software

138
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,840
um

139
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,120
for institutional we now have the

140
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,620
world's first know your customer like

141
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,220
Bank like a exchange kyc every customer

142
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,540
that comes in because we're making

143
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,400
exploits we're not Shameless about this

144
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,620
we're a vulnerability research company

145
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,560
um when we have a customer come in after

146
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,240
they go through a kyc we know who they

147
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,800
are we doing any money laundering check

148
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,479
check the public key to see if it's been

149
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,160
stolen or known stolen among other

150
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,139
things

151
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,220
they get to come in if we know we're

152
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,600
going to be able to do the work and when

153
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,400
we return the money like uh recently we

154
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,720
return over a million dollars to someone

155
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,520
and they were crying on the phone

156
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,919
and so I feel really good about you know

157
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,300
putting liquidity back into the market

158
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,740
but also getting people their life

159
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,600
savings back so I'm we're Shameless

160
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,759
about we make exploits to help people

161
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,440
and I don't know there's been many

162
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,940
opportunities in any of our Industries

163
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,259
for a long time

164
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,639
um but the Nexus of a few things where

165
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,080
people are keeping you know millions of

166
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,340
dollars under their mattress effectively

167
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,440
and they forgot their passwords and we

168
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,820
found a way where we can feel really

169
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,100
happy as white hats ethical hackers to

170
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,740
really help people and not others so

171
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,759
anyway

172
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,440
um moving forward here's a sample of our

173
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,720
Hardware lab we have about a five

174
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,979
million dollar silicon reverse

175
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:45,360
engineering lab we have scanning

176
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,120
electron microscopes focused ion beams

177
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,259
um you know to see a risk you're

178
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,600
inspecting machine inspector machine we

179
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,280
have a diamond lapidary a lot of friends

180
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,820
in uh chip re like to use nitric acid

181
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,139
lick their finger like my friend Chris

182
00:05:58,139 --> 00:05:59,940
ternovsky and then put it on the sander

183
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,160
and he has all these scars

184
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,720
um you know we do high Precision

185
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,120
reliable work now these photos are not

186
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,919
of our lab because my CTO is kind of

187
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,919
well known and we have serious concerns

188
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,419
about life safety because if you follow

189
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,800
cryptocurrency you see there's a lot of

190
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,900
kidnappings for crypto so most of our

191
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,820
teams for various people especially the

192
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,820
partners are not public except for me so

193
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,919
um but it's it's very well stocked and

194
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,139
uh maybe some point in the future we

195
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,120
will allow that but we have offices of

196
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,759
San Francisco San Diego DC

197
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,340
so recently we brought on weld Pond who

198
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,440
knows Chris Wise Opel weld Pond loft

199
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,340
loft crack anyone

200
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,539
remember we're in Sweden here so very

201
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,340
few people like to be the first who

202
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,080
remembers The Loft heavy Industries

203
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,120
hacking crew in the 90s see there's a

204
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,380
lot more here Chris is one of the

205
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,240
founders he's now an advisor and he was

206
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,940
on a call recently he said after I said

207
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,840
um for some of the problems we're

208
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,060
finding eventually in a long enough time

209
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,919
Horizon every crypto wallet becomes

210
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,080
vulnerable now so cryptography never

211
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,639
gets stronger it only gets weaker so

212
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,560
once you make your keys

213
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,660
um you know you can't patch that and

214
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,919
that's what you're going to see is a lot

215
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:06,479
of the stuff through here that we're

216
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,940
finding because uh once you create your

217
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,400
wallet and you create that key pair

218
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,960
um you can't you can patch the the

219
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,940
wallet software that created it but then

220
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,860
you got to actually move the assets from

221
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,620
the old key and so anyway

222
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,780
moving forward so today we're going to

223
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,559
talk about miracles

224
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,440
do they remember this Insane Clown Posse

225
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,880
where they have the whole yep there we

226
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,680
go we got someone over there

227
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,880
um now we're not talking about this

228
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,380
miracle but if you're curious how

229
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,300
magnets work look up B fields and

230
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,220
magnetic flux density if you were

231
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,120
curious

232
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,060
so at work we call uh exploits Miracles

233
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,440
because that's what people say when they

234
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,580
get their money back it's like it's a

235
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,960
miracle

236
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,639
um and so that's the thread we're going

237
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,599
with here

238
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,940
so in the Saint Val Kilmer played Simon

239
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,500
Templer a reformed Thief I don't know if

240
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,880
any of you've seen it highly recommended

241
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,860
he States the line in the film that to

242
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,419
become a Catholic saint you must perform

243
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,759
three Miracles today we're going to show

244
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,220
four vehicles our exploits so the first

245
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,020
one this is really the only one that I

246
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,880
worked on in this batch but let's just

247
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,620
say that of these four there's vastly

248
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,759
more that we're working on especially

249
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,919
through disclosures right now so if any

250
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,039
of you remember remember cassatious coin

251
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:15,599
um where they would pre-load crypto like

252
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,340
I think it was like 2011 or so it

253
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,539
started

254
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,460
um me and friends at Defcon actually

255
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,960
figured out with like uh acetone

256
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,340
actually was my work from argon that I

257
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,020
learned a lot of this um in Goo Gone you

258
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,419
can peel off the Tamp Revenue layer and

259
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:28,979
uh get the private key put it back and

260
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,060
give it to a friend and then take the

261
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,680
money later

262
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,360
so

263
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,279
Cold Storage coin does not do the

264
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,299
private key

265
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,740
um with money so you gotta load it

266
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,299
yourself so let's see if this video

267
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,120
slides

268
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,760
okay we're gonna do a quick run through

269
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,740
of how one would potentially compromise

270
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,440
a cold storage coins private key oh

271
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,660
sorry one thing really quick

272
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,700
um this is the attacker developed in

273
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,260
2000

274
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,140
I think it was 18 I disclosed to the

275
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,640
vendor

276
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,339
um and they haven't changed it so I have

277
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,860
responsibly disclosed many years before

278
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,240
um so if you go to Amazon to buy these

279
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,339
things you can go test this yourself so

280
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,740
this is the attack I came up with then

281
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,300
um which does not require any chemicals

282
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,060
I think you'll get a kick out of it

283
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,180
okay we're gonna do a quick run through

284
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,220
of how one would potentially compromise

285
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,760
a cold storage coins private key so you

286
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,040
can order these in Amazon online this

287
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,620
one was ordered a few weeks ago and I

288
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,720
have uh images of me doing the attack

289
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,420
directly after receiving it uh this is

290
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,120
the same unit so uh but if someone

291
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,580
needed this to be retested in a

292
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,080
completely fresh environment that's not

293
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,279
a problem

294
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,399
anyway so the idea is that when you get

295
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,380
one of these coins

296
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,320
that they are perfectly sealed and

297
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,779
tamper evidence according to the website

298
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:54,300
so

299
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,100
basically what you would do is you'd get

300
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,740
this in the in in the actual

301
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,720
retail packaging

302
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,980
um as we all know in Tampa Revenant

303
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,320
World retail packaging isn't very strong

304
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,420
um there's a lot of philosophies around

305
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,700
this but basically

306
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,160
um it doesn't really hold up I spent a

307
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,420
lot of time at Argonne National Lab

308
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,820
doing a lot of this work which taught me

309
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,680
a lot of this and uh we saw this problem

310
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,060
a few years ago and hasn't been resolved

311
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,880
again this coin was uh picked up a few

312
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,459
weeks ago on Amazon

313
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:25,200
delivered directly I repeat myself all

314
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,300
you basically need is a microscope

315
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,080
camera for like 50 bucks online or some

316
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,060
other you can actually get a mobile

317
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,820
phone with a with a lens

318
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,000
um a knife and uh

319
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,760
that's it that's all you need so

320
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,740
um what you would do is carefully slip

321
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,200
the package open

322
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,380
now again this one has been pre-opened

323
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,820
but that's not really the main point

324
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,660
here

325
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,600
main point is you take it out

326
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,040
and the idea is that you can you can

327
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,959
actually observe the package and it

328
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,060
actually doesn't have any known

329
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,160
tampering and we've done that before and

330
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,500
I will happily do that again uh you take

331
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,640
the coin out

332
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,800
now as we can see here under the

333
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,779
microscope

334
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:10,380
um

335
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,800
you know there isn't any actual

336
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,380
exposure

337
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,540
um to the

338
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,579
private key which turn on the line now

339
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,079
what I'm going to do is I'm actually

340
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,220
going to take the glove off here but

341
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,260
because these are not so great vinyls

342
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,820
but what we're going to do is I'm just

343
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,040
going to actually rub my finger

344
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,579
around the edge of the coin

345
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,019
which we have done on this coin before

346
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,680
so you see in the video actually uh the

347
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,420
um the the numbers weren't coming

348
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,440
through but if we actually now go back

349
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,600
look

350
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,540
what is that we can see X

351
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,220
so that's the private key you're seeing

352
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,380
by me just rubbing my finger on the foil

353
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,959
it's self-impression take an l and then

354
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,100
with that key you can spend the money

355
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,920
off or give it back to your friend

356
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,120
basically steal the money just continue

357
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,160
continually wipe around and at the end

358
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,079
we would wipe it off with alcohol

359
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,019
and put the coin back into the storage

360
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,000
unit like so

361
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,140
and then back into here

362
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,399
obviously you want to orient it

363
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,079
vertically so so it matches its

364
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,100
orientation

365
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,079
uh then we would actually glue it back

366
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,420
together again we've done this many

367
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,760
times cool

368
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,620
um anyway that that's the first miracle

369
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,540
that's first exploit which is is you

370
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,800
know In This Crowd you're like maybe

371
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,540
it's not so cool but you know you can

372
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,399
load a billion dollars on there

373
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,680
or one dollar you know you can do a

374
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,200
whole range of things

375
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,380
uh okay so uh next one ethereumwall.com

376
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,600
I don't know if many of you uh remember

377
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,339
it or recall it it was only around for

378
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,740
20 in 2017.

379
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,660
um late last year one of our Engineers

380
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,000
uh was looking through internet archive

381
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,279
and looking at uh JavaScript libraries

382
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,980
for what they call non-custodial wallets

383
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,660
um who does not know what a

384
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,279
non-custodial wallet is in

385
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,899
cryptocurrency

386
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:06,000
everyone knows what a non-custodial

387
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,279
wallet is here I see Americans raising

388
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,200
their hand come on there you go I see a

389
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,639
hand up here first okay could more

390
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,700
swedes come on yay all right it's true

391
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,100
thank you Matthias for giving that tip

392
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,019
earlier

393
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:20,579
he's dying over there

394
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:23,160
um so anyway uh non-custodial wallet is

395
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,019
you you have your wallet file it's not

396
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,820
at a coinbase a crack in a binance it's

397
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,620
like you know Bank of Sweden Bank of

398
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,060
America they hold your money that's

399
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,760
custodial non-custodial is USB stick or

400
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,339
on your laptop and so this website would

401
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,740
allow you to go to the website uh say

402
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,839
generate wallet and on the client side

403
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,120
it would actually generate you uh your

404
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,860
wallet your Wildfire keys and you

405
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,880
download it and you can add a password

406
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,100
or no password and then you can load

407
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,740
your ethereum on it very rapidly at

408
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,540
about the end of the year they said

409
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,820
quick uh download all your money they

410
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,220
sent an email out with a link

411
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,260
um and anyone without a password had no

412
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,060
problem anyone with a password there was

413
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,200
a bug in the code and no one could

414
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,700
download their wallet and a lot of

415
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,339
people uh have this link with a hash

416
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:08,040
fragment in their email and so um for

417
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,180
years and read a post people were like

418
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,560
how do I download it I said go to this

419
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,720
page on internet archive and it's sort

420
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,620
of worked and it only work for people

421
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,839
without passwords so

422
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,399
um basically there's a lot of stranded

423
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,899
money out there

424
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,160
um so

425
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,260
one of our first clients came in uh Bob

426
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,200
Gourley uh and he's allowing me to say

427
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,459
his name we're actually treat ourselves

428
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,380
like a financial institute

429
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,540
um take a customer privacy and

430
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,800
confidentiality extremely seriously

431
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,300
unlike a lot of people who publish

432
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,040
people on YouTube

433
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,720
um especially as we're applying Bank

434
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,880
secrecy act have to follow a fin stem

435
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,800
rules because we're moving large sums of

436
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,120
money and we want to make sure we don't

437
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,779
follow those laws as we move forward so

438
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:52,620
while came in early last year and one of

439
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,880
our new Engineers looked at the code

440
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,079
he's like that fragment looks a little

441
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:56,880
familiar and so

442
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
um got the code realized there was a bug

443
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,440
rewrote our own implementation and then

444
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,899
found a flaw uh in several versions of

445
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,820
the software so

446
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,060
um we recorded I think around 1400 and

447
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,940
change keys in version one

448
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,920
um and those were loaded uh and I don't

449
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,060
think it's too public

450
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,579
um but they had about 15 000 ethereum

451
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,500
that transited through the wallets we

452
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,260
recovered in the beginning of the year

453
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,360
um after discovering uh the flaws and

454
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,560
the code which may have been why they

455
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,660
shut it down we don't know

456
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,579
um there was only seven each left in the

457
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,019
version one wallets but we found out

458
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:34,339
that the key space was about 33 bits

459
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:37,560
instead of uh you know 180 so we just

460
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,560
generated every single key pair and then

461
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,660
checked which one was loaded that was it

462
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,180
so all of a sudden we're like opening up

463
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,740
bank accounts left and right here we're

464
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,240
finding so like a lot of the things we

465
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,420
look at here when we're auditing uh you

466
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,100
know cryptographic implementations no

467
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,360
one's doing that here and there's very

468
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,500
little experience and a lot of people

469
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,420
are just forking projects and this was

470
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,620
actually forked from a project called

471
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,060
crypto kit which was formerly Rush

472
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,079
wallet

473
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,579
um eventually it was fixed

474
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,500
um but not in this time frame so there

475
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,360
were four versions of it

476
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,860
um there's the Legacy wallets which are

477
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,680
version one and it had a CRP uh prefix

478
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,019
for the URL fragment the hash fragment

479
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:15,779
or Anna had an r d and a queue

480
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:16,560
um

481
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,660
so

482
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,980
I'm going to skip because my time's

483
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,620
running a little uh fast here so

484
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,360
basically

485
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,560
um

486
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,240
once we figure out these particular

487
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,339
problems we were able to start

488
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,139
generating all the keys now for version

489
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:32,399
two three and four we actually need the

490
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,779
hash fragment

491
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:34,980
um and so I'm going to show a quick demo

492
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,220
we had a password list for the client

493
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,459
um and so it's gonna be very quick

494
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,620
um and this this is 60 000 in I think

495
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,360
less than a second

496
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,420
all right ready I think I'm gonna

497
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,699
that was it

498
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,199
so

499
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:53,579
um no one else has this code publicly

500
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:54,720
we've been actually trying to reach out

501
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,160
to people say like hey we can fix this

502
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,019
we've also been trying to reach out to

503
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,720
Vincent uh or Sir Anthony sorry wrong

504
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,540
person Anthony diorio the co-founder of

505
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,699
Jax and decentral because we have emails

506
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,640
at the end from the Jax wallet support

507
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,459
system on zendesk and we realized we can

508
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,720
help all the people of version two three

509
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,799
and four wallets and we're trying to get

510
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,179
in touch with them but we don't have

511
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,099
there's the site's gone and so if anyone

512
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,780
knows those people which I think in this

513
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,480
audience maybe not but uh we really want

514
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,559
to get in touch with them so we can

515
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,000
actually start helping them recover

516
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,919
their assets

517
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,299
so

518
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,880
um another fun one is electrum wallet

519
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,620
um Electro mall is one of the most

520
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,960
forked uh Bitcoin and actually

521
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,400
variations of different crypto

522
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,559
blockchains wallets out there

523
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,059
um it's supported on every single major

524
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,460
OS and mobile including Tails so if you

525
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,740
install Tails uh this is the default

526
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,500
wallet that comes with Tails

527
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,200
um so we found out that there was a

528
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,780
problem in their bip70 implementation so

529
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,700
yep 70 actually just means like I can

530
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,400
scan QR codes and so that got introduced

531
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,840
into crypto wallets quite a few years

532
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,880
ago

533
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,700
we found out that they used a python

534
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,559
open statement and didn't sanitize input

535
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,299
from the QR code normally it'd be like a

536
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:08,760
URL once we discovered this we're like

537
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,440
oh this is a glaring problem and we

538
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,299
checked and the vulnerability existed on

539
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,980
every release since I think it was I

540
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,160
think if I recall April 2015 around the

541
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,980
time frame I may have the date in here

542
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,500
um and so what we did was for Windows in

543
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,780
about a week we fashioned a full windows

544
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,820
rce on Windows 10 fully passed in

545
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,400
January and so we had to go to a URI on

546
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,919
the local land so when you scan it it

547
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,100
automatically connects out or SMB on a

548
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,260
fully patched you know vanilla Windows

549
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,059
system to somewhere on the network and

550
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:41,340
so we got responders set up we've got

551
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,080
the username and then cracked the hash

552
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,880
and then we're able to connect back to

553
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,520
the system at at the same user level as

554
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,320
the application and have read write

555
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,780
executed shell so if you have an LPE you

556
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,419
can escalate or steal the wallet and so

557
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:56,100
we contacted them and said this is a

558
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,419
serious problem realized there's

559
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:58,679
millions of people that use their wallet

560
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,240
software including a lot of the Privacy

561
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,280
Community with Tails but also a lot of

562
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,780
people forked it that are major they

563
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,039
have their own major distributions of it

564
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,720
but it's identical code so we had a

565
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,980
coordinated disclosure with them before

566
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,140
this early version of this talk in June

567
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,299
happened and off the chain a conference

568
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:13,919
I co-founded I think it's like pretty

569
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,480
much the world's first blockchain

570
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,179
security conference exclusively so

571
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,280
please take a look at that later but we

572
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,780
we showed them this

573
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,520
and we find a lot of people in the

574
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,200
cryptocurrency community

575
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,940
weren't aren't from information security

576
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,740
so they don't understand attack chains

577
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,360
very well and that's okay it's just not

578
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,460
their area but when we say this is part

579
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,600
of something like well it's not so

580
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,980
serious I'm like well I mean when I'm

581
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,780
penetration testing like this is part

582
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,760
just part of you know the normal flow of

583
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,880
things so they did patch it it was great

584
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,500
um patched a number of different uh

585
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,960
Forks which I'll cover uh later

586
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,940
um but anyway here's a quick well

587
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,840
actually I don't know if the video is

588
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,340
quick and one other thing I was told

589
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,679
that if I ran a copyrighted soundtrack

590
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,299
it would take the YouTube channel down

591
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,460
so it's like much more boring I had

592
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,380
evangelists um like from Blade Runner

593
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,940
put on there because he passed when I

594
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,799
cut this but

595
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,900
um here's the video

596
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,500
and the video is not the best for a demo

597
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,660
um we just didn't automate it but I'll

598
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,600
walk you through it really quick so

599
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,980
and actually the problem is when I'm

600
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,660
using the sexual

601
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,400
sorry

602
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,179
I apologize

603
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,179
um the video is kind of long so I may

604
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:29,760
skip through it but there's a we have a

605
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,640
the window on the left is a attack

606
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,380
machine on the same network

607
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,260
uh the QR code is our loaded uh QR code

608
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,620
with a malformed URI

609
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,200
and so what you're going to see and I'm

610
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,179
going to skip because I'm really short

611
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,600
on time

612
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,080
actually what I may actually do just to

613
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,000
Skip Along here sorry I'm going to fix

614
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,860
this really fast you don't change your

615
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,179
demo live

616
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:59,660
uh uh

617
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,020
main display

618
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,620
nope

619
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,699
that's not what I wanted

620
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,580
foreign

621
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,360
perfect

622
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,299
great awesome

623
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:20,840
so

624
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,080
here we go so

625
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,460
um we actually generate a wallet

626
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,260
and there's our private key it's hard to

627
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,120
read here terrible demo but I promise

628
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,820
you it works there's the QR code

629
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,740
we're about to use the webcam to scan it

630
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,840
we're going to scan it there we go

631
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,539
it triggers now on the left that's

632
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:51,360
that's our attack system kicking off as

633
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,159
you can see there's a username and a

634
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:55,520
hash

635
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,960
and we brute force it because it's Mt

636
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,240
lamb and V2

637
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,780
and I'm going to skip through this a bit

638
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,919
the video is online if you want to watch

639
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:09,080
it and we use PS exec to connect back

640
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,620
and we're in

641
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,039
and now let's go to the money shot

642
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,360
so we're now in the directory we see a

643
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,120
change directly over to the wallets file

644
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,260
um and as you can tell like we have

645
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,480
rewrite execute already

646
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,520
and we download the wallet and here's

647
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,000
the money shot

648
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,740
so as you can see here

649
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,600
the last four like uh 1f eh CJ

650
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,679
and I'll just tell you if you can't see

651
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:42,120
it here go watch the video it matches

652
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,340
and so we were able to steal a wallet by

653
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,539
QR code

654
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,240
I thought it was pretty cool

655
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,840
all right

656
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,280
[Music]

657
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,020
so these projects were great to work

658
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,220
with electron wallet the main project

659
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,200
and all the other ones and these were

660
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,840
the affected versions that they had

661
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,940
patched the same day before uh we went

662
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,039
live with the talk

663
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,720
so and also we worked with Kraken

664
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,640
security if any of you remember

665
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,500
um spider Labs trustwave Nick percocos

666
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,179
the CSO there good friend

667
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:13,200
um he helped get us in touch with the

668
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,419
right people and helped coordinate this

669
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:16,500
disclosure

670
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,960
so treasure Hardware wallets uh the last

671
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,659
exploit here um as I say on the websites

672
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:22,980
go to Amazon the most trusted Cold

673
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,360
Storage wallet

674
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,039
I don't know if many of you know I think

675
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,860
you are of fips 144 uh the US Federal

676
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,360
standard for

677
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,640
um you know Hardware security devices

678
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,740
and they have like levels one two three

679
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,940
four

680
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,140
um you know level three being like an

681
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,880
iron key or apricorn or other similar

682
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,620
devices these none of these devices

683
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,539
actually you know have applied or even

684
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,159
would meet the standards but people are

685
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,039
storing vast sums of money on them so

686
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,080
everyone's already seen or maybe not

687
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,460
here seen

688
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,200
um the old exploit like three or four

689
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,480
years ago now but here's the modern one

690
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,260
so

691
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,059
I was told no product pitching this is

692
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:58,980
my art film

693
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,720
some people have said

694
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,720
that is a demo of us doing this and cut

695
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,280
down from 30 minutes to three minutes so

696
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,960
you give us a cold device we'll crack it

697
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,539
in less than 30 minutes

698
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:12,020
of a fully patched current trezor system

699
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,919
now there's some tweaks that would need

700
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,360
to be done for a treasure T but the

701
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,799
attacks after you extract the firmware

702
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,280
at the same

703
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:24,840
so this is when we were we were doing

704
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,460
some work remotely

705
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,080
um for the company uh one of our

706
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,900
partners one of our partner yeah one of

707
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,880
our colleagues rented a Corvette and

708
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,200
it's if you're if you follow anything

709
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,360
cryptocurrency Bitcoin blockchain into

710
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,520
conferences everyone's Lambo Lambo Lambo

711
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,260
well why not American Muscle and that's

712
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,980
kind of our clap back

713
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,820
so that's me over there as you can tell

714
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,740
same shirt and talk

715
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,580
um

716
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,679
and and this I mean this is all single

717
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,120
shot because I put this together quickly

718
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,400
but this is from end to end about 30

719
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,080
minutes and so I just chopped it all

720
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,159
down

721
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,159
foreign

722
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,260
so what we did for improvements on this

723
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,820
because we're going to skip some of the

724
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,740
major details but um you know glitching

725
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,760
is definitely one of the things that

726
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,340
were used before but on the new systems

727
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,720
that

728
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,460
um they'll wipe a lot easier so you'll

729
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,820
be we have to be much more precise

730
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,220
um so we actually uh there's some

731
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,020
changes to that uh changes to the

732
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,240
firmware attacks that we perform

733
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,340
um and also everyone you may see if you

734
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,559
look online for this solders we stopped

735
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,059
doing that entirely because sometimes

736
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:31,620
it's a little unreliable unless you're a

737
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,600
pretty solid engineer who does soldering

738
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,059
a lot so we actually just engineered a

739
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:39,299
custom socket for an stm32 so as you

740
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:40,740
when you get to that we get to the next

741
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,720
step we just drop it into the socket

742
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,000
after we remove it from the board and

743
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,860
everything's already pre-wired

744
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,179
um and so we know it's gonna be reliable

745
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,760
every single time

746
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,760
now uh last year I think it was early

747
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,279
last year Satoshi Labs updated their

748
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,600
file system they actually added file

749
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,520
system encryption they used Cha-Cha

750
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,980
which I had never heard of at the time

751
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,200
um my CTO had to explain this to me

752
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,340
um but that prevented people from

753
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,460
brooding the uh the the PIN code that

754
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,659
people set

755
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:12,480
um easily and there was only one uh

756
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,400
brute forcing tool online it was in

757
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,779
Python so if you're running it on your

758
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:17,760
CPU you're getting about 20 Keys per

759
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,260
second

760
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,840
um and so we wrote Our Own open well

761
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,240
custom opencl implementation for this

762
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,820
and so we um we'll take the firmware and

763
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,419
upload it to our GPU form

764
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:33,000
courageous Warriors against Crime and um

765
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,440
you know we're doing millions and

766
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,460
millions and millions in very

767
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,140
parallelizable millions of keys per

768
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,039
second

769
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:40,260
Atomic batteries so any digit PIN we're

770
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,520
cracking about you know

771
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,620
[Music]

772
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,299
or the length of Batman coming down to

773
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:51,740
Poland driving off

774
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,120
it means a little longer and if there's

775
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,740
a passphrase we can also crack those

776
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,539
because it's it's not really that hard

777
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:00,059
it's just it's the next step

778
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,679
um we posted this

779
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,860
online and uh

780
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,500
remember no promotion

781
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,299
um we published this online Satoshi Labs

782
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,400
is like but passphrase security and

783
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,020
we're like we just opened a million

784
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,220
dollar wall for a client and they had a

785
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,480
passphrase they completely forgot they

786
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,940
had or even had a passphrase and in two

787
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,039
hours we got their money back so you

788
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:20,820
know some people have different

789
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,460
perspectives on how this works so anyway

790
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,360
um

791
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,159
and cypherd is a company we do

792
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,600
vulnerability research and are very open

793
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,179
about that we're really here to help and

794
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:32,039
we're good we're here to get back people

795
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,320
what is loss and Bitcoin maximalists

796
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,360
they're like no no no we want to hoard

797
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,500
all the money but the problem is you

798
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,419
know and you know just general economics

799
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:42,059
liquidity adds value to the network and

800
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,460
so that's what we're doing

801
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,140
um we're trying to provide a standard

802
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,760
for the cryptocurrency and blockchain

803
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,100
industries and what three Industries as

804
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,600
to what responsible disclosure is

805
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,860
because they're not most people aren't

806
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,960
from it so coming to them would say we

807
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,700
have a problem we have a vulner an

808
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,220
exploit they're like but they're writing

809
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,620
code that is securing billions and

810
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,880
billions and billions of dollars for

811
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,440
customers and as you're seeing it's

812
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,419
getting you know stolen left right and

813
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:07,860
center and bad code actually wipes it

814
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,539
out or locks it up

815
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:12,960
um and this brings me to an uh A New

816
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,640
Concept that we've been working with our

817
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,799
advisor Stuart Baker who just wrote on

818
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,720
lawfare blog an opinion piece on

819
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,760
something called responsible rescue

820
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,740
last year when we started doing these

821
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,960
things we were generating key pairs from

822
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,320
effectively thin air I mean you know

823
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,419
figuring out the math and how to reduce

824
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:32,880
the key space we're generating other

825
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,440
people's money and we have no clue whose

826
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,179
it is most of the time this is the

827
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:37,080
problem when you're seeing like The

828
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,299
Nomad hacks or the Solana hacks

829
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:40,919
um you know that public key you know

830
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,840
it's a hat it's you know it's a hash on

831
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,779
a you know a blockchain database

832
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:48,419
but it doesn't say Eric Michelle's money

833
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,840
if you go to a exchange you'll do a kyc

834
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,000
uh and if you're honest it's like your

835
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,260
your information and everything else

836
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,419
then they know but the whole thing about

837
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:00,659
decentralized currency and assets and

838
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:01,980
privacy

839
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,360
um the vast majority of people aren't

840
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,580
known and so when we're generating

841
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,840
wallets we're like oh no this is

842
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,580
actually someone's money and we

843
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,960
discovered this before an attacker did

844
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,720
and as of June um Bob Gurley at ooda

845
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,120
Loop has a air table that uh oh one

846
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,320
minute there we go

847
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,840
um has a air table that said 64 billion

848
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,700
has been stolen hacked or lost because

849
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,860
of bad coding errors actual money not

850
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,320
not like Equifax got hacked what's how

851
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,760
do you evaluate the value of their

852
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,460
database this is real cash or crypto

853
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,500
which can be exchanged for you know

854
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,140
Euros one

855
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,059
rubles dollars or for another another

856
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:39,000
crypto and so we're having a really big

857
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,380
problem right now

858
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,000
um philosophically because responsible

859
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,640
disclosure has failed uh in this context

860
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,980
and this didn't exist before so if we

861
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,659
find a vulnerability we go to a lecture

862
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:50,039
wallet and we say hey we have this

863
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,200
problem they can patch up because it's

864
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,240
an rce but what if they have a bad key

865
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,580
generation uh system and they can patch

866
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,220
the code for new keys but now Grandma's

867
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,960
money and legitimately Grandma's money

868
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,260
is vulnerable until it is moved and so

869
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,919
we have this you know issue where we're

870
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,340
now finding large problems with people

871
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,779
who do not know how to implement

872
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:15,179
cryptography correctly and a lot of

873
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:16,799
wallets in the past and you're seeing

874
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,899
online and in the news these these

875
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:20,820
heists and we're seeing problems that

876
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,380
are now already bigger than a lot of the

877
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,399
ones you've already seen and we're

878
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:25,140
trying to figure out if we go to the

879
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,059
vendor and they tell people someone's

880
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,140
going to figure it out and then go steal

881
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,600
the money so what do we do and so we're

882
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,860
noodling on this concept called

883
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,140
responsible rescue

884
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,539
um so um because because Patch Tuesday

885
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:38,279
doesn't work anymore you can't patch a

886
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:39,779
crypto wallet with a bad key remember

887
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:42,000
like Debian uh back in the day everyone

888
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,919
had to roll their keys same exact issue

889
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,960
but now there's real cash on the line so

890
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,000
and if we move the money we're gonna and

891
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,860
we're an American company we have people

892
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,539
that we work with abroad but like you

893
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:54,000
know cfea or Computer Fraud Abuse Act

894
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,200
that's a federal felony that's prison

895
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,059
time if we move the money so we're now

896
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,279
talking with people in DC to try to

897
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,899
figure out how do we you know when we

898
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:02,340
find innocent people are not innocent

899
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,899
people's money

900
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:06,240
um how do we get through that so we get

901
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,919
authorization and not go to jail and

902
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,440
actually save people's life savings

903
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,539
so this is an interesting con concept

904
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,039
for you we've been like Stewart

905
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,600
introduced it last Friday we put a blog

906
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,279
post on it I'd like to talk with a lot

907
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,240
of people here in Industry about

908
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,399
responsible rescue

909
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,039
um because we're now at a huge Tipping

910
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,960
Point where billions to tens or hundreds

911
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,159
of billions of dollars are up for the

912
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,020
stealing and we're ahead of the curb

913
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,919
right now at the company because we're

914
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:32,039
full of analysts and cryptographers and

915
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,559
Engineers where we're focusing on doing

916
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,679
free white and black box code audits of

917
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,179
every crypto wallet software firmware

918
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:42,120
hardware and uh web Library out there

919
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,679
and we also have the world's largest

920
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,480
database that we that we can tell which

921
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,860
we have thousands and thousands of

922
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,419
versions of software that we're now

923
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:49,919
about to do static code analysis across

924
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,899
plus our own proprietary

925
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:53,700
um you know research and finding those

926
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,320
problems so we think we're about to open

927
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,779
uh Pandora's Box and we want to make

928
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:01,080
sure that we secure these systems ahead

929
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,059
of time so if anyone wants to discuss

930
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:04,620
this that's my email

931
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,260
please contact me find me afterwards

932
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,419
um and uh yeah thank you for listening

933
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:10,980
to my talk I want to say thanks to team

934
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,740
Kairos Tom Smith Jerry Maguire Max Cohen

935
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,720
Tony Beretta and virus that's the real

936
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,279
virus from Defcon so if you head out

937
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,659
there say hi

938
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:20,100
um I want to thank a few more people my

939
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,080
business partner Elizabeth Dell

940
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,940
um I moved to LA briefly in 2020 I did

941
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,559
the most La thing possible I opened an

942
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:27,659
entertainment production company

943
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:29,700
so we help uh make sure on screen

944
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,620
hacking and crime is accurate and period

945
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,059
correct and in person and we've actually

946
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:34,980
worked on our first uh finally got our

947
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,179
first film out that we worked on called

948
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:38,279
masking threshold last year Serene who

949
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:39,720
wrote snowflake for tour she's doing her

950
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,100
own thing called snowstorm now she wrote

951
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,020
the soundtrack and a few of our other

952
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,220
partners

953
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,320
and that's it thank you so much I hope

954
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,060
it wasn't too fast

955
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,980
[Applause]

956
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,419
cool thank you very much Eric
