1
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:06,720
so hi we are here on the SEC T stream

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,660
with the second sport custom and now we

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,700
have Lucas with us who just came off the

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,320
stage thank you very much good to have

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,619
you back in about oh yeah when you have

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,420
season two yeah I don't know hopefully

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,779
we will get

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,320
you well it was a Shore to to record it

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,359
was yeah yeah it was weird you can get

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,640
it but now we're back we're back and but

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,960
you are back that's the most important

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,960
before we start I just have to say that

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,940
if you didn't like you were watching the

16
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,040
stream now you yeah you not the one in

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,320
the back you have to watch this talk if

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,180
you don't know anything about the thing

19
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,739
you presents it doesn't matter because

20
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,440
he has the best slide deck of

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,780
secretary's history it's like it's

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,239
beautiful it's art like you should have

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,579
you should have an award thank you they

24
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,260
are so nice to look at yeah thank you

25
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,820
like rendered and stuff you have to tell

26
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,559
me how it works later but yeah it was

27
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,140
really cool uh can you give us just a

28
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,060
quick elevator pitch

29
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,700
um all right so uh Cisco switches which

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,180
have a specific protocol that allows you

31
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,119
to deploy switches faster so if you have

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,939
a switch and pull it into a big Network

33
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:19,560
and you have 500 switches you want it to

34
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,240
be going like this yeah new

35
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,680
configuration that is called smart

36
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,840
install yes sure now

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,119
what if someone found not a

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,619
vulnerability but a way to actually

39
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,780
abuse the smart install to download and

40
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,939
upload configuration files as well as

41
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,759
reflash the firmware

42
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,979
and that was found by by dosnetiskov I

43
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,979
think his name was in Russia 2016. yeah

44
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,380
where he presented which almost broke

45
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,180
into it right yeah yeah definitely yeah

46
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,119
definitely no it's exposed I mean you're

47
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,860
not supposed to expose this and it's

48
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,899
exposed meaning you can download

49
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,240
configuration files and upload and do

50
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,619
whatever

51
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,479
it's pretty devastating right yeah

52
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,740
that's what it's called the you know

53
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,960
decide for Horsemen cyber wolf and the

54
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,000
fourth yeah

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,219
one night that it takes five minutes to

56
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,259
ride it 10 minutes execute it and we

57
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,520
have a winter

58
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,099
that's insane yeah yeah and now we are

59
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,020
in a better State than we were for

60
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,120
instance 2016 when this was announced

61
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,540
now because but still people yeah sort

62
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,540
of deployed deployed I don't know what

63
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,080
is going on they deployed we had 320 000

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,180
2016 and the number was probably even

65
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,200
higher

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,959
before I talked to John Madeline showed

67
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,739
him to actually have the port yeah yeah

68
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,540
so it could be indexed and what yeah

69
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,959
it's pretty

70
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,420
don't you it's like where are we going

71
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,819
it's like it's a sad world that we live

72
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:51,180
in where we have this tip of the iceberg

73
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,519
sort of do the right thing but yeah the

74
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,280
greater masses don't no exactly so but

75
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,260
okay give us the but be careful the

76
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,239
research here how how many hours did you

77
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,980
put in before you you showed a lot of

78
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,019
nice this yeah this started like way

79
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,879
back when I was doing the mqtt as well

80
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,319
so this was going on in the background

81
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,300
yeah since I got this script from about

82
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,000
it I needed help optimizing it and was

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,800
it a client found it used it and then

84
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,080
it'll hit me like can I do this

85
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,900
on the internet of course yeah

86
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,180
like every time it's like can I do this

87
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,599
then yeah but this was I mean we're

88
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,900
talking two three years of

89
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,959
constant pain yeah

90
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,780
finding sources that had configuration

91
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,000
files online that I downloaded and went

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,980
through right

93
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,819
um

94
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,640
and what I've seen there it would would

95
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,958
crush a man's heart

96
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,440
yeah but I mean it's it's it's you know

97
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,060
this seems to be a repeating pattern

98
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,140
that vendors are you know trying to

99
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,019
implement functions to facilitate easier

100
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:02,900
management

101
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,080
but why don't they do the you know go

102
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,220
the full

103
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,939
and 10 yards and and really protect that

104
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,280
yeah in a sound way I mean only a

105
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,858
username and password will say stop yeah

106
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,720
even if that one was used by multiple

107
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,399
switches and sources it was a stop if

108
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,860
it's exposed yeah so that is that is one

109
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,180
thing to do it

110
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,360
but what is really like the saddest

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,919
thing is that Cisco put this as an

112
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,759
informational so this vulnerability is

113
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,000
abuse there we go is informational which

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,400
means that it bypassed all the ideas the

115
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,820
idps and the filtering and the the abuse

116
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,740
parts that will flag you if you're doing

117
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,240
something nasty

118
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,220
so when I scan way back to see how many

119
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,800
vulnerabilities how many were vulnerable

120
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,560
I got zero emails back nobody reported

121
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,840
this abuse usually I get like tons yeah

122
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,600
like Angry Housewives or whatever no but

123
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,400
but you get you get like the the

124
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,259
standard I'm gonna block your IP I'm

125
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,580
going to call the internet police you

126
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,740
know the standard yeah yeah it was

127
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,199
crickets yeah that's that's weird yeah

128
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,960
yeah but I guess yeah it's a Management

129
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,199
Port it's not but it's like it's like

130
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,000
since you can actually query it to get

131
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,460
everything back yeah of course that they

132
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,479
uh the uh the hashes are encrypted but

133
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,520
that's better now than it yeah I I guess

134
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,199
it used to be really bad no but I get

135
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,720
suspect you yeah thanks

136
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,320
made like

137
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,720
the likely Berlin an awesome guy uh he

138
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,139
made Cisco's life terrible and like he

139
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,120
is like one of the forefathers of like

140
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,220
hacking Network appliances Google it

141
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,039
it's insane uh and I get flashbacks of

142
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,259
that now like it's like what the hell is

143
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,120
going on to make it to make it even

144
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,560
worse

145
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,660
um do you know what csgo password 7 is

146
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,960
yeah yeah around 80 to 90 of those

147
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,259
classroom yeah

148
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:00,600
that is um that is like reversible even

149
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,280
if you have the password equipment

150
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,780
remember you cannot upload configuration

151
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,940
files let's add our own user with our

152
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,160
own password and let's enable SSH yeah

153
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,120
boom

154
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,919
and that gets deployed as well without

155
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,919
any authentication yeah

156
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:15,479
so it's like immutable repository of

157
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,160
configuration yes

158
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,840
so bad

159
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,759
it's horrible so hopefully this doesn't

160
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,440
go down

161
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,020
I mean it's doable it's a one-liner you

162
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,340
can do this in one line and I hope the

163
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,720
internet doesn't go down tonight yeah

164
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,860
it's like big gam PLS or bgp and DGP oh

165
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,740
yeah I mean we have backbones we had

166
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,580
weapons manufacturers armies government

167
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,520
entities backbones of internet but how

168
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,419
do you go about it do you do

169
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,580
responsibility do you mail them say like

170
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,340
or do you try to communicate but you get

171
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,560
no responses how many did you reach out

172
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,840
to I mean for the last three months I've

173
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,880
been focusing on this yeah

174
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,060
um I reached out to hundreds uh got

175
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,280
response for 20s and then I thought I

176
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,139
can't manage this and manage my own

177
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:02,759
company at the same time right so I need

178
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,500
to focus in-house so focused here at

179
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,080
Sweden to actually call people up to

180
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,000
LinkedIn and connect to get them too

181
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,440
high I'm not trying to sell you

182
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,240
something I just want to make you aware

183
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,060
yeah I just want to make you you know

184
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,460
secure your yeah exactly that's

185
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,380
that's the approach you want it's like a

186
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,220
big finger coming up saying dude dude

187
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,380
but um you should take this uh video

188
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,599
like the stream now and just send them

189
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,060
the video look at this yeah they call me

190
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,479
later yeah call me later yeah exactly

191
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,340
yeah yeah definitely yeah definitely but

192
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,960
speaking of that tell us what's going on

193
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,539
in your life oh wow

194
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,120
um I have a dog yeah and his name is

195
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,440
Loki yeah Loki no he's watching yeah six

196
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,419
yeah

197
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:49,979
no but I've started my own company right

198
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,080
so um cold

199
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,500
skull key yeah so I started this with

200
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,660
the goal of actually as cliche as it

201
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,620
sounds to make the world a little bit

202
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,539
more secure than it was and to make

203
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,699
money yes but that's not the main goal

204
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:06,060
just to to add more value than to the

205
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,919
standard pen testing reports that we get

206
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,720
that you'll say here you go fix it I'll

207
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,639
call you later bye-bye I want to be

208
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,780
there with the client and help them get

209
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,000
to the bottom because 22 plus years in

210
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,199
IIT security

211
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,940
it's the same vulnerabilities they only

212
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,919
Shift Place sure so we need to attack

213
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,479
you from another point of view and that

214
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,400
is actually getting some processes in

215
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,259
place how boring that even sounds but

216
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,539
still to get that whole flow going yeah

217
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:30,360
so it's been 100 focused on that focus

218
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,219
on my health a little bit

219
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,219

220
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,200
