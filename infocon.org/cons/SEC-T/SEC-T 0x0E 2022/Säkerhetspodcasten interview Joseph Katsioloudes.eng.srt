1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:08,039
so we are here on uh the Friday of uh

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,580
second 2022 and we have Yusuf here from

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,820
uh GitHub and you just came off stage

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,119
talking about code ql and I have to

5
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,160
admit before this conference I've never

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,820
heard of code ql but it's really awesome

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,800
thanks so much for that and you are not

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,500
the only person there uh someone in of

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,779
the speakers Jonathan yesterday asked

10
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,640
how many of you have played with code 12

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,500
before yeah and you have five people or

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,760
something exactly you were one of them

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,520
so four yeah yeah all six okay yeah so

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,980
adding mat Yahoo didn't I like raise his

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,660
hand yesterday let's say like six seven

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,300
people in the whole conference outside

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,940
of 1200 people yeah and absolutely today

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,980
you see way more hands up and I hope

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,960
that more and more people are playing

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,940
around with it and joining our community

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,100
yeah for sure could you just give us

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,980
like a quick elevator pitch of what Q

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,199
what problem it solves with QQ

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,260
absolutely

25
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,780
yeah Swedish hey what's going on to make

26
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,119
it easier code stands that stands for

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,420
quote query language yeah allows you to

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,659
query your code as if it was data in the

29
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,240
same way that you can use SQL to query a

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,280
database you can use codeql to query

31
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,439
your code so the problem that it solves

32
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,680
it's finding the way we use it is to

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,680
find security vulnerabilities in the SAS

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,340
way the static analysis way yeah and uh

35
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,560
what is what would you say is the hard

36
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,960
thing of implementing this oh the hard

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,479
thing is that you have false positives

38
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,060
which is something that all people are

39
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,479
suffering in the world of sust yeah to

40
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,240
avoid this from happening we try to work

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,759
more and more on our technology uh

42
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,040
culture is a tool that is 13 years old

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,060
therefore over the over the years we

44
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,560
abandoned being just a tool that

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,960
navigates an abstract syntax tree that

46
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,420
is your code now in the form of that

47
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,759
tree being transformed to be able to get

48
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,660
searched but we also use AI in the form

49
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,940
of machine learning to radiate false

50
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,739
positives and at the same time we have

51
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:16,140
our community based on the community

52
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,239
contributions and the work we do we

53
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,599
polish the queries of this language into

54
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,379
the level to not have false positive as

55
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,300
a hard thing but turn it into an

56
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,520
opportunity for more and more people to

57
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,620
see it as a benefit that we have yeah so

58
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,120
talking about the community how does

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,879
that work is a security researcher can

60
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,060
actually submit

61
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,519
a sort of patterns or my own proof of

62
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,280
concept in code ql or how does it work

63
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,560
that's one way yeah you can be part of

64
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,480
the community yeah like you are a Buck

65
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,239
Hunter you are interested into submit a

66
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,180
query into our back Bounty program that

67
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,580
eradicates a vulnerability pattern or is

68
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,340
very targeted into a specific problem at

69
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,680
the same time in our community we have

70
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,300
people that are coming from the

71
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,280
Enterprise world that are the security

72
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,160
people within that organization

73
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,500
responsible to write uh culture queries

74
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,620
for the bespoke code that exists in

75
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,720
their code base and they want to catch

76
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,280
up with the latest trends we have in our

77
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,280
slack community and learn how people are

78
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,260
doing things what queries are new they

79
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,780
are make sure that they grow their

80
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,700
Network and at the same time they are

81
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,659
skill set within the community sure so

82
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:34,860
um let's say I'm a big Corporation

83
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,840
and I think this is the most awesome

84
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,720
thing ever how do you get started then

85
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,120
today my presentation had the title

86
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,879
secure your code like NASA which I think

87
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,799
you will agree that it's a big

88
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,900
Corporation sure sure they have really

89
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,700
safety conscious like people will die

90
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,860
yeah exactly so we have companies of

91
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,860
that level but at the same time smes the

92
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,540
way to get started is to first of all

93
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,239
use the product to pick up alerts they

94
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,340
have and at the same time someone can

95
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,900
learn code ql from inside the

96
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,879
organization the same way that anybody

97
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,420
could start learning today the number

98
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,180
one thing that they would benefit to be

99
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,279
more productive faster in their Learning

100
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,798
Journey because yes I want to be honest

101
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,180
with you there's a bit of a steep

102
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,979
learning curve yeah sure it took me six

103
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,020
months to be like super proactive with

104
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,180
it and in those six months I was playing

105
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,940
let's say maybe four hours per week just

106
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,720
to give like a realistic thing here

107
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,860
um

108
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,680
it's very rare to start from scratch

109
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,720
nowadays because it's a tool that is 12

110
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,020
years old you tend to build on top of

111
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,900
the knowledge and the work of others by

112
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,479
extending queries that are already there

113
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,120
like like every like programming thing

114
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,860
out there like you never do something

115
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,020
from scratch like standing on it yeah if

116
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,060
you're not maybe like a very like into

117
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,759
low-level stuff then probably you do it

118
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,560
like

119
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,900
but yeah that makes a lot of sense it's

120
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,699
like it's a cool thing you you learn

121
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:07,740
something new every day and this is like

122
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,300
the powerful thing of this is that you

123
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,340
it's the speed right and the amount of

124
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,660
data you can actually shoot through

125
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,240
without actually looking at it but then

126
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,580
again so mitigating false positives will

127
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,860
be like a a big problem to solve because

128
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,139
that if there is too much people won't

129
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:23,880
use it because it's useless they think

130
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,740
they didn't even matter just into it

131
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,199
manually right I will invite anybody who

132
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,660
wants to like compare these two to other

133
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,860
sus tools to run the same code against

134
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,900
the same sus tools yeah see the outcome

135
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,419
and decide for themselves I think we are

136
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:40,800
confident about the amount of post

137
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,600
positives because we polish the queries

138
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,440
so that our let's say good enough

139
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,660
without anybody spending any effort on

140
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,000
false positives for 95 percent of people

141
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,979
and there's that Niche amount of people

142
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:54,780
because at the end of the day false

143
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,000
positives are subjective yeah depends on

144
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,280
your code yeah just that amount of

145
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,639
people to maybe affect or tweak

146
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,860
something that we give to make it a bit

147
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,800
more specific that is specific for their

148
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,960
bespoke code base yeah and avoid an

149
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,400
alert that might not want to get anymore

150
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,160
yeah so another question am I allowed to

151
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,960
scan something that I don't know

152
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,020
uh yes as long as it's open source for

153
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,060
example if you have something in your

154
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,340
supply chain like you import a library

155
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,220
if this library is open source why don't

156
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,120
you just fork and then you enable code2l

157
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,699
and see what happens yeah

158
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,620
oh that's pretty cool yeah okay it was

159
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,199
okay yeah yeah I I got another idea of

160
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,759
the talk but that makes sense of course

161
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,580
that makes sense because it's yeah that

162
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,979
then then now I'm happy cool that's good

163
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:45,960
you had a conference that you wanted to

164
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,400
plug

165
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,520
um so uh when when when and where is

166
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,740
