1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,340
so good morning we are uh live sort of

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,700
live on the second T stream here with

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,559
the second Sport costan and we have

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,560
Martin with us who just came off stage

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,420
talking about uh how to mess with Teslas

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,240
and the Bluetooth low energy that they

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,060
use for uh for their uh their keys and

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,699
the communication with the cars right so

9
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,098
I was an awesome talking I've had to say

10
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,680
I've watched so I'm actually one of

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,100
those who watched your videos uh so um

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,219
part part of the statistics anyway

13
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,079
um we

14
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,079
yeah

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,020
as uh amazing research I'd have to say

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,399
it's uh

17
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,739
it's really takes some dedication right

18
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,860
yes it was quite some work you can ask

19
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,379
my wife

20
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:03,480
uh yeah she was bearing with me during

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,400
the whole time and she was giving me a

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,260
lot of support and it wouldn't have

23
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,740
happened without her if

24
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,180
from what I understand your your garage

25
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,520
isn't near your house or yeah it's like

26
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,380
we live on the second floor so it's like

27
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,420
down the stairs down to The Cellar back

28
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,460
out to the back of the house and then

29
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,740
there's the garage so it's taking five

30
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,820
minutes for me to get there

31
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,460
extended like particular reason because

32
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,580
you start not with tech grader uh Tesla

33
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,500
radar uh

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,900
and then you went down into more and

35
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,079
more security research yeah like was it

36
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,720
like the insanity just kept going a

37
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,759
bigger bigger or did you have like some

38
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,040
particular goal in mind I didn't have a

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,259
particular goal in mind I always wanted

40
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,960
to know more about the protocol spoken

41
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,079
between the phone and the car and I

42
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,479
don't know for what reason it did take

43
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,780
me so long that I didn't try that out

44
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,119
because I think it came down to being a

45
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,560
little bit bored and having that

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,479
Hardware lying around and that idea

47
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,758
which existed for a long time in my head

48
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,459
so and finally in June of last year I

49
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,800
plucked that all together and I said I

50
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,900
was really disappointed of that just

51
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,379
working out of the box so no specialized

52
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,920
scripts no whatever two Raspberry pi b

53
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,560
plus the ones that do not consume a lot

54
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,599
of batteries since I had to always swap

55
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,879
the batteries after my five minutes walk

56
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,400
to the car so there's no electricity in

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,940
the garage so always the the tech was

58
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,340
powered off USB power Banks yeah yeah

59
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,420
and um and B plus raspberry you know I

60
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,700
have some lying around still some more

61
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,220
left and I was happy to have a use case

62
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,920
for them yeah yes that's good good use

63
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,200
of old Hardware yes so finally it's

64
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,940
paying off being a hardware message yeah

65
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,620
yeah

66
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,180
and it

67
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,580
and I think if if we break down a little

68
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,720
bit well what you have done or learned

69
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,580
so first of you have done

70
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,040
some research in collaboration with

71
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,680
owners with understanding with Tesla

72
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,720
protocol messages

73
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,680
and you have built the Tesla radar app

74
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,159
which makes you find Teslas close by no

75
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,560
so the Tesla radar app was the very

76
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,239
first thing I did because of that

77
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,540
permanent ID that every testimon 3y have

78
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,780
and I just feel felt intimidated by that

79
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,580
and I just did that I have in order to

80
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,980
Showcase it in order to make this fact

81
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,220
more known to Tesla owners and also for

82
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,280
them to complain at Tesla in order to

83
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,959
make them

84
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,379
change that yeah so it started out as a

85
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,420
privacy issue it started out as a

86
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,159
privacy issue and and all that came

87
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,620
along later on was out of curiosity yeah

88
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,200
and later on you also find out that this

89
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,440
weird number that uh is some hashing

90
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,940
thing and you could build a rainbow

91
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,819
table to do it yeah that was a big

92
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,860
coincidence yeah I was playing around

93
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,620
with crypto uh with cyber Chef right you

94
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,560
know that and I was pasting in stuff

95
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,739
because also out of boredom and later on

96
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,918
I found that Char one method in the

97
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:19,918
obfuscated code but I did not look for

98
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,320
it beforehand so that was a big a lucky

99
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,380
punch for me should we do like

100
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,479
assuming someone doesn't know a rainbow

101
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,940
type we are super genius here so we of

102
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,040
course know everything

103
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,860
but but uh

104
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,699
uh to to a Layman person uh what is

105
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,460
what is a rainbow table and how do you

106
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,580
use it so the issue of the problem I

107
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,199
shouldn't say I shouldn't start out with

108
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,080
the problem I should say the situation

109
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,100
is that this eight bytes are generated

110
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,800
that are used in the Tesla name they are

111
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,919
generated by using the sha-1 hash off

112
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,440
the bin and the sha-1 hash is a

113
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,479
cryptographic hash which is one way

114
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,880
right you cannot reverse its direction

115
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,419
and see so this is the Sha one hash what

116
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,400
was the clear text that was hashed with

117
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,940
that you can't do that and even worse so

118
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,280
this is not a full shot one hash that is

119
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,280
used in that ID on the device name it's

120
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,560
just the first eight bytes of it yeah so

121
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,160
it's it's a chopped out a chopped up sha

122
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,460
one hash and of course even if there was

123
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,139
a reverse direction for it you couldn't

124
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,940
use it since it's not a full hash right

125
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,919
yeah but the idea behind that rainbow

126
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,160
table is and since a bin number is a

127
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,620
very defined string of characters and

128
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,000
numbers

129
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,080
you can just make up every possible bin

130
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,199
there exists and since they have a

131
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,419
structure you can say only for the first

132
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,580
three characters it's encoding the

133
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,220
manufacturing location and you know it's

134
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,080
like two different or three different

135
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,440
values for that and you make up a long

136
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,400
long list of these possible bin numbers

137
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,979
and you Hashem exactly how Tesla would

138
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,380
hatch them yeah like you do a sha1 and

139
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,539
take the first eight bytes and you do

140
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,419
that for every possible combination and

141
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,280
of course you end up with having more

142
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,440
win numbers that there actually are yeah

143
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,400
but you have every possible one but when

144
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,319
you just take the first first couple of

145
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,460
bytes

146
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,220
um wouldn't that increase the the risk

147
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,919
of having collisions yeah a lot yeah

148
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,620
yeah there is a risk of collisions but

149
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,139
also for Tesla this is this might become

150
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,759
an issue right yeah but I think it's

151
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,160
it's not very often so it didn't happen

152
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,800
for my experience yeah and also because

153
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,500
it's not the full range of characters

154
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,319
even still it's possible right but if

155
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,360
that would happen I think Tesla just

156
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,120
exchanges two cars right yeah and one is

157
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,160
a model three and one is a model y so

158
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,660
this Collision doesn't happen anymore

159
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,639
for this serial number or whatever I

160
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,680
think the um Liberty there

161
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,319
is it isn't it like the security level

162
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,039
of a 64-bit hash is 32-bit I think you

163
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,759
probably half it so I think after

164
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:13,319
producing four billion cars you would

165
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,160
start

166
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,280
running into random collisions

167
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,060
um could be but but

168
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,280
it would take a while yeah it is

169
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:33,900
still producing assuming randomly so

170
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,699
maybe we can assume that they never plan

171
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,940
to do as many cars yeah

172
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:43,259
all right cool so anyway your your

173
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,360
your research started out as sort of

174
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,099
sort of privacy focused and then you

175
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,560
went down the rabbit hole and and

176
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,620
started looking at the the uh the

177
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,120
communication between the car and the

178
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,099
phone

179
00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:00,599
and also you you were talking about

180
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:05,340
um the the uh the PIN to drive function

181
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,020
that that's

182
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,039
sort of a mitigation but not quite but

183
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,979
how how do you think I mean you were

184
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,259
mentioning that Tesla was a

185
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,080
early adopter of the using the phone as

186
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,900
as a key but what what could have did

187
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,900
they have done to to sort of make this

188
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,220
better so the first idea I had is we use

189
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,159
pairing right Bluetooth does have Legacy

190
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,159
security mechanisms as pairing but then

191
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,620
I I discovered that within that protocol

192
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,659
they also have like different form

193
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,000
factors for keys and one of the form

194
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,520
factors would call would be called Cloud

195
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,060
key yeah so and I think that they have a

196
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,700
big big catalog of use cases that this

197
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,980
technology is going to be used for and

198
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,440
Cloud key would be like I have an app

199
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,260
download the key for a Tesla that I

200
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,420
rented and then I'm able to unlock it

201
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,519
and drive it right and by having a

202
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,580
feature like that it prohibits the use

203
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,459
of pairing because pairing implies that

204
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,800
I have seen that vehicle with my phone

205
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,440
already which is not the case in this

206
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,600
scenario right so I think they limited

207
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,120
the up options for security quite a bit

208
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,399
by introducing more and more use cases

209
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,620
as many people do right but yeah

210
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,080
but but for rental companies like um I I

211
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,019
know that some some car manufacturers

212
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,019
use the the telematics backend for for

213
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:37,320
use cases like that so when you've

214
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,019
rented the car the the actual key is in

215
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,240
the car but but you can unlock it with

216
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,980
your phone but then you're talking to

217
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,320
the back end of the telematics system

218
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,899
and you're not actually talking to the

219
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,120
car so it's the telematics system that

220
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,100
unlocks the car and you can go in and

221
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,600
get the key and drive

222
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,480
yeah I also had thoughts about that and

223
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,220
why Tess is not doing it like that

224
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,800
because they do have that API and that

225
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,440
is also be capable of of starting the

226
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,540
car and everything yeah but it requires

227
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,760
you to have a internet connection yes

228
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,740
and that makes the overall thing less

229
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,800
reliable and it introduces some some lag

230
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,740
right yeah

231
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,580
it's drug parked at home yeah

232
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,500
right so and I think they do not want to

233
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,600
get punished for being Innovative of

234
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,420
introducing that kind of new feature by

235
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,399
just failure of internet connections

236
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,920
which is not under that control well

237
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,959
should we just

238
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:39,180
very quickly like because like the 132nd

239
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,279
attack

240
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:43,320
which you showed uh

241
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,940
should we explain that to people who

242
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,980
haven't seen the presentation like like

243
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,579
what what is the core impact of it

244
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:54,240
so the core impact is that whenever an

245
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,000
owner is using the NFC key card that

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,560
came with the vehicle in order to unlock

247
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,600
it

248
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,320
attackers in the vicinity and saying

249
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,180
vicinity is like the Bluetooth range

250
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,700
which can be extended to several hundred

251
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,100
meters

252
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,320
and I also prepared a video for that I'm

253
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,600
not sure if I'm gonna releasing it so I

254
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,579
did an experiment over 200 meters I

255
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:20,459
wanted to have a 600 meters down from a

256
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,860
castle where I live but this Castle is

257
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,320
under is currently closed so it could do

258
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,959
couldn't finish the video but you know

259
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,480
every time that key card is used in

260
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,360
order to lock or unlock the car

261
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,779
attackers could use their VC Sac clients

262
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,839
so to speak and enroll their own key

263
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,579
into the vehicle you could use it

264
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:44,640
anytime yeah yeah and I think

265
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,620
it makes it really obvious in the video

266
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,240
that something is wrong

267
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,079
like because because it basically

268
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,300
you're just using your key card if you

269
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,459
imagine that you are the person under

270
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:59,100
attack so using the card you're gonna

271
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,700
enter and somehow suddenly there's one

272
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,200
person more

273
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,019
who who has control of your car so the

274
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,760
funny thing is if you're using your

275
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,279
phone as a means to unlock the car and

276
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,740
you have the official app you will get a

277
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,480
notification whenever there's a new key

278
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,720
enrolled into your vehicle yeah but once

279
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,880
you read that it's already the case

280
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,279
right yeah and in order to get rid of

281
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,560
the key you have to go to your car and

282
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,540
delete it from the car menu you can't do

283
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,640
that with your phone you can't even do

284
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,500
that on the web page so you have to get

285
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,180
to the car which is maybe no longer

286
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,359
there

287
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,459
actually I I enrolled my my phone uh I'm

288
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:44,040
not driving a Tesla I'm driving a a pole

289
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,440
star but I enrolled my phone but then

290
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,220
then I I realized it's such a hassle uh

291
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,899
enrolling a phone because you have to

292
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,800
get all the the keys for the car bring

293
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,620
them in the car before you can enroll so

294
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,079
I I haven't actually gotten around to

295
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:03,660
enrolling my wife's phone because it's

296
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,639
it's just too much trouble yeah that's a

297
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,480
good experience yeah yeah so she can

298
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,880
track me

299
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,459
but but I mean that's that's one one way

300
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,639
of solving that is like you you have to

301
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,000
sort of bring all the tokens into the

302
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,639
car before you can enroll a phone

303
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,320
um but I think I mean

304
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,720
that's a serious design flaw that you

305
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,240
can just you know once you use the NFC

306
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,079
card you can enroll in other key yeah

307
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:36,420
this whole authorization timer uh things

308
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,300
started in August last year since you

309
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,579
know like people like our parents I'm

310
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,740
not sure if they're still there but my

311
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,079
Mom would for sure not use her phone for

312
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,720
driving a Tesla if she had one yeah she

313
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,820
would always use that key card and I

314
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,200
think in August last year they

315
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,720
introduced a feature that using the key

316
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,260
card as a single means of using the car

317
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,300
becomes more convenient so this whole

318
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,019
authorization time at least 130 seconds

319
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,380
these exist because of not having to tap

320
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,540
the key card again so you unlock the car

321
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,240
you get in you buckle up you fix your

322
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,639
mirrors or whatever and then you start

323
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,160
to drive and that usually takes up up to

324
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,959
130 seconds and that single

325
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,700
requirement not to having to tap again

326
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,880
just made this whole attack possible

327
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,200
yeah

328
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,959
and it's convenient so yeah so they're

329
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,180
trading security for convenience and

330
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,920
that's obvious case in my opinion

331
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,260
all right well um do we have any more

332
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,360
questions or should we uh I'm sure we

333
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,420
haven't but but it also requires our

334
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,220
brains to be working but I mean

335
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,940
this is super interesting yeah

336
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,540
and I think you kind of uh touched it a

337
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,800
little bit that

338
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,060
your belief is that

339
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,459
they want to add more and more things

340
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:08,459
which doesn't need to be strongly paired

341
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:09,600
with the car

342
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,839
and that might be one of the reasons why

343
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,240
it's easier to launch attacks here

344
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,680
because

345
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,980
one one one thing would be having super

346
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,220
hard pairing and require a strong Crypt

347
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,220
in all directions and if a counters

348
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,579
go out of sync or anything you disable

349
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,440
everything

350
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,579
um

351
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,620
but they have built like a very

352
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,380
forgiving protocol

353
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,980
and sometimes that goes really really

354
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,699
wrong

355
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,120
so my take on that is so I'm not

356
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,220
protecting Tesla by saying that it's

357
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,980
just my assumption and my observations I

358
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,540
believe that there's a really high

359
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,120
fluctuation of good personal at Tesla so

360
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,500
they're paying that money they're

361
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,660
getting good people but the thing is

362
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,720
that they often leave the company again

363
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,000
whenever they had a great idea and I

364
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,699
believe that the csac protocol is not a

365
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,139
bad thing it's it's a lot of thought

366
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,600
went into that but I believe that after

367
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,519
the guy who invented that whole thing

368
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,100
left the company somebody else took up

369
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,680
that and didn't fully comprehend what it

370
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,260
is capable of doing for example every

371
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,360
authorization request that the film

372
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,940
sense of the car sends to the phone is

373
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,399
always getting authorization to drive

374
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,560
even though I just want to unlock yeah

375
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,560
so there's different levels of

376
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,899
authorization but only one is gonna use

377
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,360
by the car so that tells me that

378
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,639
somebody who's programmed the car did

379
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,680
not fully comprehend the security

380
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,440
intentions of the profit but

381
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,000
I mean

382
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,060
it seems like

383
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,160
once the Euro had told them about this

384
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,079
attack and identified it

385
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:58,860
I at least to me it seems like

386
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,060
ought to be

387
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,079
things that could be done

388
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:06,660
with the limitation that I don't

389
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,799
understand the particular vehicle issues

390
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,559
and how

391
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,959
specifically done but for example when

392
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,839
when something is being added

393
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,819
you could imagine that you you start

394
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,339
doing the attacker wants to add to the

395
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,799
to the vehicle and then you could

396
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,500
imagine that the screen would pop up

397
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,860
and ask you to manually press OK that

398
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,520
this this pairing is accepted yeah yeah

399
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,160
you know that's a funny thing because uh

400
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,039
it's I think 18 years ago when I did the

401
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,140
car Whisperer have you heard of that yes

402
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,299
yeah and that was about using a

403
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,100
directional Bluetooth antenna back then

404
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,380
it was Bluetooth classic connect to a

405
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,179
hands-free set of the cars back then

406
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,940
which didn't require a pairing pin or

407
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,039
just had a standard pairing pin sorry

408
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:58,380
and then you could talk into the car and

409
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,120
also listen into the car in the

410
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,120
conversations there so cool but I liked

411
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,160
it too so that was fun from the highway

412
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,640
bridge and everything but what uh what

413
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,679
happened then or I was talking to Audi

414
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,840
back then in the days and they said you

415
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,059
know we can't just do that we can't have

416
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,380
that dialogue you're talking about

417
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,620
because we have that silver book and

418
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,440
that silver book that defines all the

419
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,720
interaction with our brand it's not

420
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,600
about tech anymore it's about no the

421
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,640
brand and the how to deal with an Audi

422
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,740
that has to be different right and and

423
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,840
you as a customer you buy into that kind

424
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,559
of

425
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,860
elegant way of using and that prohibit

426
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,620
prohibited the the tech people of adding

427
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,500
a button press right and maybe Tessa is

428
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,320
not that far when it comes to Legacy and

429
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,440
car making but I could well imagine they

430
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,559
have stupid rules I think so yeah that

431
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,160
might be be the case because you know 95

432
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,620
of the people buying that car they want

433
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,940
convenience they don't care about

434
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,700
security yeah

435
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,320
not saying that

436
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,200
it becomes extremely common

437
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,400
to steal Tesla cars using

438
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,799
variations of these attacks maybe they

439
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:17,760
change it then but as long as

440
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,960
the amount of highly intelligent

441
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,280
Electronic Theft

442
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,900
a low

443
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,960
maybe there's an incentive to no no no

444
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,419
we keep user friendliness and we

445
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,080
prioritize that and we will only stop

446
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,140
prioritizing user friend less once we

447
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,660
have a huge problem

448
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,880
as long as it's less than one percent of

449
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,179
Tesla cars being stolen per year using

450
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:46,799
this then

451
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,039
uh a deal with it with a money fitting

452
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,559
or something like that yeah that sounds

453
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,720
like the the

454
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,940
risk model of

455
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,340
credit card companies like they they uh

456
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,160
they just you know chew up the losses

457
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,860
from card fraud to prevent people from

458
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,679
stop using credit cards yeah yeah in a

459
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,419
way I was talking to cynical people

460
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:11,820
about that as well and they say yeah why

461
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,280
should a car manufacturer do something

462
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,559
against the theft of the cars they will

463
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,020
end up selling more of this right and I

464
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,179
see their point but as long as test is

465
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,220
not in the insurance business it's maybe

466
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,260
what they think but that's gonna change

467
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,640
right

468
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,919
yeah

469
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,960
cool well Martin it was that awesome

470
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,179
talk thank you so much that was nice

471
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:34,620
talking to you and thank you for having

472
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,620
me yeah and we we like

473
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,840
both the technical details but I also

474
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,260
think you have done a great job with

475
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:43,940
um

476
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,340
visualizing it in videos yes because to

477
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,679
me I think if I would read a technical

478
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,980
description of the 132nd attack

479
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,580
uh yeah sure there's some timer blah

480
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,640
blah blah but when you see it in a video

481
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,000
it becomes much more clear and and and

482
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,320
especially if we imagine that you want

483
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,059
to reach someone who isn't working with

484
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:08,039
IIT security and he isn't working with

485
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,140
Rich decision it's very very well yeah

486
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,780
yeah I'm a very visual person myself and

487
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,520
that's why I'm using that way of

488
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,080
conveying it

489
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,740
well good awesome thank you and enjoy

490
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,240
the rest of the conference thank you

491
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,539
very much
