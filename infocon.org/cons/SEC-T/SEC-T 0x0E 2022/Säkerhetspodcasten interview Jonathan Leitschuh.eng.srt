1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,880
nice welcome back to another interview

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,660
with Jonathan light shoe yes so I nailed

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,139
up one from Germany no not from Germany

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,480
Boston Boston yeah well but the name is

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,920
from German Watertown but you know

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,119
Boston's where everybody's gonna know

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,220
from yeah yeah you can actually hear it

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,920
on the way you say Boston right yeah I

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,080
grew up in Vermont okay which is north

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,599
of yeah it's you know land of trees and

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,760
you know and ski slopes and ski slopes

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,800
and I grew up on the verge of uh I

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,960
wasn't on I was I didn't live in the

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,219
middle of nowhere but I lived on the

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,020
edge of the middle of nowhere yeah yeah

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,120
that's pretty cool yeah wow and you were

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,460
into robotics yes I started my high

18
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,440
schools robotics team when I was uh in

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,620
my junior year so what do you do then

20
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,480
robotics team I see there's like Robo

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,579
Wars thing in my head no no no it's High

22
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,219
School robotics is uh two robots there

23
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,440
are four robots on a field this is Vex

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,600
robotics so it's there's a game usually

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,280
like score these points on these goals

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,079
you know build the best robot to do that

27
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,780
you've like you know 20 seconds of Drive

28
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,939
of autonomous and then you know a minute

29
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,979
and a half of driver control and you're

30
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,960
driving this robot around and

31
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,060
competition's all the way up to the you

32
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,320
know World level

33
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,200
um so both my junior year and Senior

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,119
year uh so I started in my junior year

35
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,060
and then uh went for an entire year

36
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,340
competed almost winning every single

37
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,200
event oh cool and the first event was

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,759
terrible we came and dropped it last um

39
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,439
but the rest of this and then

40
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,439
um uh on the last event like you know

41
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,000
days before the World Championships

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,259
qualified for the World Championships

43
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,000
went to Florida and went to the World

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,979
Championships both years uh and and got

45
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,680
to meet teams from around the world

46
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,200
I got I went to uh I said I want to go

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,340
get a degree in this so I went to

48
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,740
Western Institute got a degree in

49
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,680
robotics and then said you know I like

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,000
this robotics thing but I also love this

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,500
programming thing so I tossed on a

52
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,659
computer science major and uh and so

53
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,340
double major then double majored and

54
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,579
then have ambitious yes yeah well so

55
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,920
most people at WPI get a double major in

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,200
either robotics electrical robotics

57
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,840
mechanical or robotics computer science

58
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,818
um and that's how you sort of went into

59
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,800
the field of seeing yeah so I took Asian

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,360
security yeah I took a security class in

61
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,500
college

62
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,959
um popped my first shell in a PHP based

63
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,060
application of course yeah right as you

64
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,680
do and you know I had a lot of fun I was

65
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,260
like oh this is so cool and so

66
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,060
I've been interested in software

67
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,280
security I listened to security Now by

68
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,440
Steve Gibson for a long time right yeah

69
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,420
yeah it's been right yeah yeah so Steve

70
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,520
Gibson and Leo Laporte have been kind of

71
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,480
like an educator in my in my career uh

72
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,640
for many many years

73
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,459
um and you know I I the first

74
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:42,780
vulnerability that I found was actually

75
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,640
an accident yeah it was in the Gradle

76
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,620
plug-in portal and it was uh for those

77
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,239
of you that are familiar with

78
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,000
um

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,819
uh dependency uh confusion sure

80
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,980
um it was basically that but I could

81
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,980
induce it by uploading a prod a package

82
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,780
to the Gradle ecosystem that was one

83
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,120
version higher than than the officially

84
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,400
for official version of a package and so

85
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,019
if you're using Wild Card versions and

86
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,400
your dependencies you'd get my version

87
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,620
instead of the intended version okay but

88
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,060
did you commit so it's like immutability

89
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,540
issue it was a name spacing issue in

90
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,800
their authorization they weren't

91
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,959
correctly validating that the namespaces

92
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,040
were not being stepped over

93
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,959
yeah so I I dispose that vulnerability

94
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,819
to them and actually Google had beaten

95
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,099
me to it by 10 days no

96
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:30,659
um but I weaponized it into something

97
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,459
that was actually like you know you know

98
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:33,659
usable like this is you know they said

99
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,220
here's this vulnerability or here's

100
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,659
there's this bug and I'm like no it's a

101
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,519
vulnerability so

102
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:39,840
um and then I basically found enough

103
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,860
vulnerabilities and gradles

104
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,000
infrastructure did that they offered me

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,060
a job eventually so um it was better

106
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,400
yeah yeah just come join us and help us

107
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,400
out yeah so you know I basically

108
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,500
hacked I'm not I'm not I don't consider

109
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,599
my well I'm I'm a hacker in so far as I

110
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,680
do things with things systems that

111
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,920
people don't expect I'm not I'm making

112
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,299
this stuff up as I go I'm you know like

113
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:01,739
it's yeah

114
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,120
um but you know basically hacked my way

115
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,040
into my first job as a security person

116
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,659
and then

117
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,340
um is it a better way of doing it like

118
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,599
that's how you should do it yeah right

119
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,159
you know it's basically like you know

120
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,720
you're I'm a software engineer turn

121
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,099
security researcher I know how software

122
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,239
engineers build things that are

123
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:16,320
potentially vulnerable and I guess

124
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,120
that's like a pretty common background I

125
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,100
would say in order to get into the line

126
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,019
of work and you will get a lot of domain

127
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,940
knowledge for free yeah I guess so that

128
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,860
makes sense but today you talked about

129
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,940
uh code ql uh code ql and open rewrite

130
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,460
and using static code analysis not just

131
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,900
in the static clone analysis but also

132
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,320
using static code analysis to find and

133
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,240
then automate automate the fixing of

134
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,740
those security vulnerabilities at scale

135
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,020
so a lot of static code analysis tools

136
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,120
find the vulnerabilities but once you've

137
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,500
found the vulnerability why stop it

138
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,180
finding the dang thing why don't you

139
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,800
just fix the whole thing like and just

140
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,960
get it over that makes a lot of sense

141
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,660
because like I do only offensive work I

142
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,120
never fix anything okay so this is the

143
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,979
problem this is the line I'm going by so

144
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,000
it makes a lot of sense to have

145
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,500
ecosystem that actually can suggest

146
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,780
fixes as well yeah it's uh pretty cool

147
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,560
yeah and that's like quite clever I

148
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,380
think because when you have

149
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,660
you're both dumb the

150
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,000
searching for vulnerabilities

151
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,580
um

152
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,180
great best effort of determining if it's

153
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,600
not vulnerable like you stated you look

154
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,639
for the path and you also do

155
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,400
some sanity checks that it's actually

156
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,620
true there isn't an obvious

157
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,360
things which make is not vulnerable

158
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,060
right so so that's one level of work and

159
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,620
then

160
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,900
firing off all of these

161
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,740
uh block yeah narrated

162
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,940
commits or a pull request with a good

163
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,240
description and then dealing with all

164
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,720
other people problems yeah yes yeah yes

165
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,940
that's a nice way of putting it yeah yes

166
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,460
so it's it's a yeah like you know it's

167
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,280
an amalgamation of uh uh a technical

168
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,160
problem and you know uh more technical

169
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,620
problems and then people problems and so

170
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,960
you know I I don't claim to be an expert

171
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,880
in any things but I just know how to you

172
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,440
know throw things together and if I need

173
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,960
something I will you know buckle down

174
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,460
and build it myself if I really need to

175
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,979
like you know I I base my I had to

176
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,600
rewrite control flow on data flow

177
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,000
analysis from scratch and I use code

178
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,620
ql's data flow and control flow analysis

179
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,080
and so I'm like well you know it's not

180
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,520
bad complicated I can probably build

181
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,960
that it was more complicated than I

182
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,580
thought it was going to be but you know

183
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,560
like you know you you you use Fearless

184
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,940
Fearless approach how hard can it be

185
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,259
yeah right it's like a good Mantra to

186
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,419
have yeah yeah that's pretty cool yeah

187
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,160
and then I you know had an intern Sean

188
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,680
meta uh who uh is not with me anymore

189
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,600
because he uh is back at school and

190
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,639
actually he got hired so he was my fell

191
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,400
the fellowship intern at human uh under

192
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,479
me

193
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,900
he was recently hired by modern to uh to

194
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,039
continue working on stuff so if we

195
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:06,120
modern was one of those uh

196
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,220
two providers where you could look at

197
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,039
several Source codes at the same time so

198
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,419
modern is the company behind the there

199
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:16,979
they are the primary maintainer of open

200
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,560
rewrite and then they also offer a SAS

201
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,580
offering to let you do do the so the

202
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,099
commercial application of modern SAS is

203
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:29,400
to buy into your company and and and use

204
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,020
the recipes they've written or that you

205
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,419
write as your company to fix you know

206
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,240
bugs styling issues you know like you

207
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,979
know you need to do a dependency upgrade

208
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,360
and it involves rewriting a bunch of

209
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,280
code like that's the kind of stuff that

210
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,380
modern handles and I saw this technology

211
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,479
and like I see the corporate benefit but

212
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:46,319
I'm like

213
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,419
let's just use like this technology so

214
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,220
let's throw this as open source and fix

215
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,620
and it's the it's the only one

216
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,060
um mend has a similar bit of technology

217
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,039
that they're working on it's in beta but

218
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,199
there all their stuff is commercial and

219
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,300
closed Source right and so I'm like you

220
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,039
know Open Your Right is open source I

221
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,539
can sit down write the code see the

222
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,340
change write the tests

223
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,340
and anybody can can utilize my fix for

224
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,800
free yeah and sure it gets sold to a

225
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,000
corporate entity is something that gets

226
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,099
fine whatever like great but like I get

227
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:15,840
to see the work get contributed back to

228
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,280
open source and have a positive impact

229
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,780
around that's good that's really good

230
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,419
that's a good change software company or

231
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,000
organization

232
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,300
human human is my employer

233
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,680
so human

234
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,219
um is Dan's Dan was the co-founder of

235
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,440
human security and so the damn Community

236
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,179
Fellowship was created by human to

237
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,860
commemorate his memory to support

238
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,380
someone that was trying to do work that

239
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,520
helps improve the security of the

240
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,380
industry writ large

241
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,140
um and you know uh in doing some project

242
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,399
that helps improve the security of the

243
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,779
industry and

244
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,580
um I you know when I saw that I had this

245
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,459
idea in this proposal and I threw it out

246
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:54,720
there and said you know hey I've got

247
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,459
this idea and they accepted it and so

248
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:59,100
now I'm you know doing it doing it I'm

249
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,399
doing it yeah talking about it too so I

250
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,660
wanna I wanna share this it's not just

251
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,120
that I did this work it's you know I did

252
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,779
this work cool right the the bigger on

253
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,700
top of this a bigger part of it is I did

254
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,680
this but so can you right like this is

255
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,140
something that is not like

256
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,120
you you if you understand

257
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,680
vulnerabilities if you've seen the same

258
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,000
vulnerability again and again and again

259
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,240
like it's not

260
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,260
uninfeasible for a security researcher

261
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,519
that becomes aware of a vulnerability

262
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,380
that's widespread for them to go and

263
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,640
just eliminate it from the open search

264
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,620
system right like that's a lot of power

265
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,420
that we don't realize we have and I'm

266
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,220
trying to evangelize that and let them

267
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,899
let the security Community know that

268
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:38,399
like we have this capability let's go

269
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,500
use it oh it's pretty cool there's like

270
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,420
that's a good thing that must feel very

271
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,000
good right yeah yeah it's like a like a

272
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,260
higher purpose thing you know yeah yeah

273
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,980
yeah and you go and you get to do it as

274
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,420
your date job that's pretty cool until

275
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,339
January yeah and then then I've got to

276
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:54,600
find another job which I'm trying to

277
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,339
find a place to land this project with a

278
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,440
company yeah oh yeah so yeah okay

279
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,640
foreign yes

280
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,500
[Music]

281
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,920
um so the basically is that do good

282
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,380
right so they

283
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,260
um they're yes so they they the thing

284
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,600
that they sell is uh bot mitigation so

285
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,760
they do they do they do yeah they do um

286
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,339
bot mitigation detecting fraud abuse

287
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,080
against your website

288
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,540
um anomaly more or less like an anomaly

289
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,339
detection ad fraud sort of stuff and so

290
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,019
that they're but they wanted to

291
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,120
commemorate Dan's memory and having him

292
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,500
been the founder and so that's why they

293
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,240
created the fellowships yeah awesome

294
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,420
yeah I agree yeah but like I like those

295
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,640
kind of initiatives where it's like

296
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,100
making internet a better place it was

297
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,459
like a good Credo like you do it once

298
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:47,760
create this sort of security product

299
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,860
but we'll nobody admire the approach

300
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,480
like there is a lot of security products

301
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,399
that are as we say closed Source Black

302
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,800
Box revenue is the most important thing

303
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,779
here we do the exact opposite we're

304
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:59,760
sharing we're building an ecosystem that

305
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,980
everybody can learn from which is really

306
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,540
cool I wish I could say that I only

307
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,860
Break Stuff and I never share the

308
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,019
details more or less but with the client

309
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,360
this is like you sleep better I think

310
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,120
because I I feel

311
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,399
I identify a lot with what you said like

312
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,620
when you see a bug class you get to know

313
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,180
it yeah and you see it over and over

314
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,000
again uh that's like the same thing when

315
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,620
you do pending test it's like it's the

316
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,600
same Vector it's the same injection

317
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,820
point just a different in a different

318
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,740
place of the code it's over and over

319
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,079
again same thing you go back the next

320
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,959
year you find not the same hopefully but

321
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,940
different vectors on the same topic in

322
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,800
the same domain so you don't really

323
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,019
learn anything that's what feels like a

324
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,579
groundhog day thing so he's like oh now

325
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:43,260
we're here again I'm gonna give you a

326
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,220
midlife crisis with this next oh no no

327
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,220
I resigned I made it resign okay so

328
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,200
somebody wrote did this I don't remember

329
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,700
the name and I really wish I could find

330
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,260
I remember the name of the person that

331
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,480
gave this talk but

332
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,980
um there's this thing about security

333
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,300
researchers

334
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,339
security researchers are constantly

335
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,560
creating things but they're creating

336
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,660
things with the intention of that thing

337
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,940
getting destroyed right whenever you

338
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,279
write a POC the intention of that proof

339
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,600
of concept is that it'll never work

340
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,440
again that's that's 100 goal right

341
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,680
and so someone said to me or someone in

342
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,899
this in this they said if you do this

343
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,279
job long enough

344
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,800
you will leave behind a bunch of

345
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,140
projects that like are no longer useful

346
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,519
to it like they're not like they've done

347
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,380
their work at that time but they like

348
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,180
that you've not built anything to leave

349
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,560
behind

350
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,839
they will never see the day of light

351
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,339
right well then they should like they

352
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:40,019
should short term right like or they

353
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:41,519
should they saw the day of light to be

354
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,620
relevant in the moment yeah right but

355
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,600
yeah but you never fully not live alone

356
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,160
right right that's the goal is you don't

357
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,200
want them to live a long life right and

358
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,019
so where can right right so where can we

359
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,000
do something that leaves something

360
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,100
behind that you know because people are

361
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,420
going to keep writing these same phone

362
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,160
numbers right like oh we see that yeah

363
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,300
let's shoot yourself in the foot yeah

364
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,160
right the exploitation chains are

365
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,899
arguably longer now but it's the same

366
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:06,360
issue right so how do we eliminate them

367
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,560
so that the developers stop shooting

368
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,760
themselves in the foot again and again

369
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,459
and again and so I think that trying to

370
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,139
get these things into the wider open

371
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:14,579
social community and get them into

372
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,740
places where not only are we like giving

373
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,680
them the like we we go so far as not

374
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,420
just to say here's the fit like here's

375
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,800
the way to you know you got to check out

376
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,600
this code you got to try this project no

377
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,339
no here it is all the way to your

378
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,779
project here's the pull request right

379
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,700
like just merge this damn thing and

380
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,019
you're done yeah and you're done and

381
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,180
then on top of that I would love to set

382
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,040
so one of the things that I'd like to do

383
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,160
this week is so all of the bulk program

384
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,720
generation campaigns that I've done in

385
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,079
the past have run and never been rerun

386
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:44,940
right so like they you know if something

387
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,380
new comes up and the new the

388
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,300
vulnerability reappears it doesn't get

389
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,639
fixed right I would like to complete

390
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,620
that loop I would like I'd like to turn

391
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,420
yeah I'd like to like I'm going to set

392
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,660
up a get up action Cron job that

393
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,720
basically operates as a campaign that is

394
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,720
just continuously every week going and

395
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,740
checking out all the projects that

396
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,959
modern is aware of running the zip slip

397
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,579
fix generating the pull requests and so

398
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,440
if there's anything new it'll just get

399
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,300
added and we're good and like then from

400
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,339
that point all you have to do is make

401
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,639
modern aware of that project and it'll

402
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,320
start sweeping yeah and cleaning that's

403
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,019
pretty cool yeah that would be cool yeah

404
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,300
and then you should like uh yeah we're

405
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,620
just adding more vulnerability at that

406
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,519
point it's like adding more

407
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,139
vulnerabilities to get fixed right it's

408
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,560
like you know

409
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,720
you

410
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,639
write a generalist rule for detecting it

411
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,019
and so

412
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:40,680
um

413
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,199
has there been any logic to which

414
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,380
vulnerability you look for it was just

415
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,959
oh from ship slip and I I went with zip

416
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,060
sleep or like

417
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,180
is there specific reason why you picked

418
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,959
like four or five yeah so temporary

419
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:01,740
hijacking I went after first because

420
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,480
um it was a good like it didn't need

421
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,680
data flow analysis didn't need control

422
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,180
for analysis you could look at the chain

423
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,000
really close together and see it and so

424
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,620
it was a good candidate for I actually

425
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,000
didn't write the recipe for that

426
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,800
particular fix it was written by Patrick

427
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,000
way

428
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,279
um from Modern to fix partial pattern to

429
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,079
fix that vulnerability

430
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:20,279
um and so it was a good like

431
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,899
demonstration of technology to make sure

432
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:22,980
that it could do what I thought it could

433
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,839
do and then from there I'm like okay but

434
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,040
if I want to fix other vulnerabilities

435
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,660
like partial path I need data flow

436
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,279
analysis like I can fix it for The

437
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,959
Unique like I can fix it if it's all in

438
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,880
line but I can't fix it if it's bigger

439
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,920
than just an inline call right if it's

440
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,339
it spans multiple lines and so

441
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,680
um that was and then so zip slip was a

442
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,180
natural progression from there because I

443
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,160
looked at it it was the function the

444
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,540
scope of the vulnerability was usually

445
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,160
scoped to a single function

446
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,380
and data flow control flow in its

447
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,060
current form only supports a single

448
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,800
single procedure call it doesn't support

449
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,040
multiple procedure calls right and so

450
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,899
um I need to find vulnerabilities that

451
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,459
you know are good candidates that can

452
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,639
exist in that scope longer term you know

453
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,959
because we're going to build the

454
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,279
technology so like you know I'm built

455
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,420
I'm I'm

456
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,740
other organizations have built this

457
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,120
technology I've got to rebuild it in

458
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,860
this infrastructure right probably

459
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,779
hopefully with a larger team

460
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,880
um as we get further and further along

461
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,260
right we can tackle more and more

462
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,579
complicated vulnerabilities like I would

463
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:20,339
love to tackle uh well I mean if it's

464
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:21,779
one of these Sports C support like C

465
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:23,639
sport I mentioned up on stage

466
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,899
um memory corruption vulnerabilities

467
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,040
like there's whole classes of memory

468
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,300
captions vulnerabilities across but then

469
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,980
it sort of Demands a little bit more of

470
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,980
your actual yeah and then on top of that

471
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,720
but like you know I would love to fix

472
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,839
Zips or uh SQL injection sure right SQL

473
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:38,220
injection in order to fix that though

474
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,759
you need to know is this input coming

475
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,800
from user Supply data or is it a static

476
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,079
constant that may contain a valid SQL

477
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,579
that does need to be escaped and it

478
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,040
needs to be flavor specific as well yes

479
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,279
yeah right so you just do this but I it

480
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,779
should be yeah but it should be doable

481
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:00,660
uh but it is a more complex problem to

482
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,000
solve than just uh yes a binary approach

483
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,099
and zip slip was a high so it was a high

484
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,720
impact vulnerability sure it leads to

485
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,760
remote quality sure worst case no it's

486
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,880
it's a bad one but but it was simple

487
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,740
enough to fix an entirely reduce the

488
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,299
scope so that's that and so I'm looking

489
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:18,179
for more vulnerabilities that have those

490
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:19,919
similar characteristics but are slightly

491
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,900
more complicated to slowly build out

492
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,419
yeah to get to that point so yeah so and

493
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,579
you know pretty very interesting right I

494
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:28,140
was talking to someone and jumping

495
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,179
backwards is also fine like I I also was

496
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:31,980
talking to someone about there's a bunch

497
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,559
of regular expression to Dos right redos

498
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,320
vulnerability sure yep that's a find and

499
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,120
replace sort of fix basically a lot like

500
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,400
you can't do like massive fixings of

501
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,860
regular expression denial service

502
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,900
across the board because like you'll end

503
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,980
up I was talking to this guy he's like

504
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,120
you'll end up with more complicated

505
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,559
regular Expressions if you try to

506
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,660
automate it but there are certain like

507
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,980
patterns that are showing up on stack

508
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,240
Overflow again and again and again and

509
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,440
again

510
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,660
yeah yeah that's a good example yeah you

511
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,539
can just go like go fix that right right

512
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,400
and that's that's not data flow analysis

513
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,900
that's not control phone no no that's

514
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,240
fine and replace yeah and it's a static

515
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,400
yeah yeah and it's a it's a bit

516
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,900
regardless it's still a perfect

517
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,660
candidate yeah and it's still a huge

518
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,720
problem yeah yeah so it's like

519
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,419
[Music]

520
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:16,080
um

521
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,220
to

522
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,100
the CM used open re-ranked for yes for

523
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,039
Java and regular expressions for you

524
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,140
know

525
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,240
regular expressions for other things

526
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,240
because I I know uh

527
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,780
for a specific company where they often

528
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,320
coded in exactly the same way I used

529
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,020
checked style and just parser and I knew

530
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,480
that they in general if a variable had

531
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,940
the same name it was usually the same

532
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,400
thing in their circuits yeah so I

533
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,340
basically assumed that everywhere I see

534
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,679
a variable with a specific name I could

535
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,660
guess that it was the same object and so

536
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,660
but

537
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,140
uh getting back to the point here yeah

538
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,400
so

539
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,039
reg XP no no like the open rewrite it is

540
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,020
specific or can you does it handle

541
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,240
several languages So currently it

542
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,679
supports

543
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,080
um Java groovy

544
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,760
um and then a bunch of data format

545
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,059
languages like uh terraform uh XML

546
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,039
gamble Json so if you have Json files

547
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,559
you can make format preserving apps tree

548
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,720
Transformations on XML terraform should

549
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,340
be more or less jumbled with the

550
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,460
resource construction with objects

551
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,900
terraform is H H con H is okay okay so

552
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,539
and then there um they're currently at

553
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,340
export for a language that is ubiquitous

554
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,600
that nobody wants to write anymore

555
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,760
that's very very old

556
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,000
see yes

557
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,260
but it's actually pretty common anyway

558
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,059
like yeah it's common but nobody wants

559
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,320
to write no no no and there's nobody

560
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,760
wants to touch it because it's so

561
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,380
they're adding Cobalt support yeah

562
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,200
that's their current next thing but then

563
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,280
on top of that they want they want to

564
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,720
add more languages but I wonder about

565
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,520
the incentive behind that part of this

566
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,440
company like yeah there's companies that

567
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,000
say we have a lot of cobalt that we need

568
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,799
yeah we need to they pay for the r d

569
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,900
baby yeah yeah so but like it's you know

570
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,400
it's they see the application of

571
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,559
previous you know they won't use it for

572
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,240
Java and groovy and stuff like that like

573
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,559
oh my God we have all this Cobalt code

574
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,059
that needs to get migrated or needs to

575
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:19,679
get dependency updated and we just never

576
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,419
touched it because it's so old and

577
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,160
nobody knows how to write it yeah so if

578
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,960
you can put in some predictable like

579
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,660
we've tested this rewrite recipe and

580
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,400
know that it does the correct thing yeah

581
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,140
you the company is more likely to trust

582
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,820
that ah sure

583
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,820
service

584
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,820
um

585
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,280
I guess you can parse a regular

586
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,880
expression to detect if it's uh now it's

587
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,160
in deep water seriously

588
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,820
no bad patterns yes yeah uh but then

589
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,500
again what do you diff like and you have

590
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,900
to have an outcome like yeah

591
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,640
that is that's a really hard problem

592
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,799
right because you have to have a you

593
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:04,140
have to have a constant outcome of that

594
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,360
like you have to know exactly what

595
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,220
you're looking for because you won't you

596
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,500
won't expand it yeah because that you

597
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,480
can parse the regex because that will be

598
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,039
huge right yeah yeah that would break

599
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,039
your thing no no no no so yeah so my

600
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,460
question is

601
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,940
but but my core question is

602
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,260
uh

603
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,780
we can detect known that

604
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,940
yeah

605
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,419
statically like email verification so

606
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,400
whatever and I guess then you could

607
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,400
provide a hard-coded prepared in

608
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,179
advanced effects yeah yeah less sure

609
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:43,679
based on the input you got previous yes

610
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,179
yeah

611
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:50,840
but with handling the general case of

612
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:56,400
yeah it's not possible but

613
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,020
there's a lot of the bad regular

614
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,220
Expressions that are just those

615
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,740
pre-canned ones right so like that has

616
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,240
to be the way it's like right it's like

617
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,919
how you know there's only so far you're

618
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,720
gonna win yeah right and so you gotta

619
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,280
you gotta you gotta yeah it's like it's

620
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,799
the it's the Practical versus the like

621
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,380
you know trying to be perfect and yeah

622
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,120
don't let Perfection be the don't let

623
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,740
Perfection be the enemy of good enough

624
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,159
yeah

625
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,679
no but like you know most like a lot of

626
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,600
payloads like the people are gonna try

627
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,700
are gonna be against those regular

628
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,380
Expressions that are commonly known to

629
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,720
be vulnerable and like uh every hard

630
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,940
problems have multiple fixes and none of

631
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,740
the fixes will probably be the perfect

632
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,720
one correct so like

633
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,480
like can't solve everything at once yes

634
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,400
iteration I think it's better better to

635
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,580
actually make something than nothing

636
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,860
service like but there were there were a

637
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,500
bunches like the language when pen

638
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,140
testing in

639
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,080
the before yeah long ago yeah that was

640
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,640
part of

641
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,940
I I think almost every single

642
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,220
first time I tested a system

643
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,140
that was that was one of the findings

644
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,820
which I had

645
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,820
and

646
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,900
uh and I I think if if I would have had

647
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,580
access to the source code I would

648
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,760
suspect that the same reg X which is on

649
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,400
stack Overflow is probably in all those

650
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,380
code bases sure but that's sort of a

651
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,640
problem that you sort of fix here where

652
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,799
you have bad and bad known ones yeah

653
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:31,799
oh yeah so the price yes so I mean but

654
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,299
the long terms of your company here's a

655
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:34,919
fix in open right just go run this

656
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,440
against your all your Source codes and

657
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,360
that's that's the beauty of it yes but

658
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,340
circling back because I think we should

659
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,400
write up uh wrap up sorry

674
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,140
speaking at code blue in Japan I'm

675
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,080
speaking at uh the OAS global app site

676

679
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:25,440
I don't know whether or not see what

680
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,620
happens yeah see what happens so um and

681
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,120
uh

682
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,340
yeah uh I'm just you know I'm gonna be

683
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,140
here

684
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,820
so trying to do something similar to

685
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,860
what you're doing yes there's another

686
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,980
company called open refactory that is

687
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,840
trying to do this for python yep and

688
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,059
mend is trying to do this but with a

689
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,640
proprietary solution and they took the

690
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,260
approach of focusing on control flow and

691
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,940
dataflow first and then

692
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,919
later going for

693
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:54,720
making sure that this the formatting

694
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,840
looks right which you know if only these

695
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,780
two things could just come together

696
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,039
the whole thing will be solved and like

697
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,260
it just merged them together but I don't

698
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,460
know what the success rate will be on

699
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,520
that so you know I'm yeah

700
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,120
freaking closed doors open source yeah

701
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,799
I have a little alternative solution

702
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,980
here we remove all the white spaces from

703
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,900
all programming languages and we

704
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,539
Implement that the developers editor

705
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:25,940
decides how the code looks yeah okay

706
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:37,380
versus spaces and that even dude changed

707
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,039
my space into a tab that's not okay yeah

708
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,320
that will go away

709
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,840
maybe I can't change the universe but I

710
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,520
like that idea but I can't change the

711
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,500
universe you know that's not a fight I'm

712
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,080
gonna die I'm gonna die on it's not it's

713
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,000
not the correct Battlefield one naked in

714
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,760
right oh yeah right no well with those

715
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,000
