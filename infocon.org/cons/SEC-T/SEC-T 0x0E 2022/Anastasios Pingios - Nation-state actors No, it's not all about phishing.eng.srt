1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,279
hello everyone i will try to keep it

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,720
interesting since you just came back

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,240
from lunch

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,719
so talking about nation state actors uh

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,719
first some definitions when i'm talking

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,719
about nation states i'm talking about

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,440
intelligence agencies spy agencies

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,279
all the countries have them and in this

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,039
talk i'm not going to separate them it's

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,279
military and the civilians since it's

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,359
going to be more abstract around how

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,039
they operate

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,199
typically national states

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,279
are there to do the dirty work for

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,120
governments and military what i mean by

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,719
this one is that

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,280
there are certain things that

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,800
there are two big components of what

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,399
they're doing the first one is

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,239
collecting information to answer

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,360
questions

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,040
the way they do that is typically using

23
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,800
means that are illegal outside their

24
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,239
country

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,160
on the other hand in many countries not

26
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,920
in all of the countries they are also

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,800
doing

28
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,320
operations

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,079
for example in the us they call

30
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,239
covert action in russia they call it the

31
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,079
active measures in some european

32
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,520
countries they call it the special

33
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,039
intelligence operations

34
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,360
there are main names in summary it is

35
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,360
not only understanding

36
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,760
the threats but changing

37
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,479
the outcome for instance it could be

38
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,240
influencing elections

39
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,400
it could be

40
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,080
participating in some paramilitary

41
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,920
operations supporting certain insurgent

42
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,759
groups it could be bribing it could be

43
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,680
all sorts of activities even going as

44
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,040
far to assassinations or

45
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,080
yeah like

46
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,720
actual genetic operations so for

47
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,320
instance where cyber fits into all of

48
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,280
that

49
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,000
how many here are uh familiar with the

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,840
jamal castro djs from 2018

51
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,960
okay

52
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,640
a few people so for people that are not

53
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,400
familiar in 2018

54
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,000
that person a journalist was

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,040
assassinated in 30 and that was later

56
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,119
attributed to the saudi intelligence and

57
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,640
you would say okay what this has to do

58
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,360
with this talk well later it was

59
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,040
discovered that both his mobile phone

60
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,479
and his family's mobile phones were

61
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,240
compromised and we don't know if that

62
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,640
was part of the operation but

63
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,719
we can assume that maybe it helped plan

64
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,360
this operation

65
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,639
okay so

66
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,959
having given this general introduction

67
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,239
of who

68
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,720
of what i'm going to be talking about so

69
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,879
why am i qualified to talk about this

70
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,400
that's a good question because i have

71
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,720
never worked in any intelligence agency

72
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,959
and that's probably also the reason why

73
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,239
i can talk about these things like i

74
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,040
never had any clearance which means yeah

75
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,319
i'm just talking about open source

76
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,400
information here

77
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
and so i have been working information

78
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,840
security for some time i started from

79
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,840
the offensive security vulnerability

80
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,760
research and exploit development and

81
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,920
then i switched to the bluetooth side so

82
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,120
i know that some of the work that i

83
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,120
initially did ended up being used by

84
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,720
nation states

85
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,760
but yeah a leader switched sides

86
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,840
so some of you might know me from a blog

87
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,440
that i have been running for more than a

88
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,680
decade and the initial it was most again

89
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,360
about exploit development and then more

90
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,280
around uh

91
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
intelligence topics cyber espionage and

92
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,840
so on i have also talked about lots of

93
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,280
different topics in the last few years

94
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,840
on cyber experience some more technical

95
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,280
some less technical like this talk is

96
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,440
not going to be very very technical

97
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,280
and also for the last couple of years i

98
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,800
started a youtube channel called the spy

99
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,239
collection where i'm sharing some of the

100
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,840
things i have acquired over the years of

101
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,760
researching that area some are physical

102
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,360
some are digital

103
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,120
and i also started this year a

104
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
newsletter which called spy news and

105
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,400
here is the interesting part with this

106
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,120
one

107
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,800
every week there are multiple stories

108
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
about espionage around the world

109
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,120
but what we see it is only two kinds of

110
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,879
stories either stories that are

111
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,200
intentionally out there for instance an

112
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,720
agent might want to pass a message so

113
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,640
they are control leading that

114
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,840
information

115
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,519
or things that went wrong so an

116
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,000
operation that didn't work as planned

117
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,159
now all of us work in different areas

118
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,239
and probably all of you understand that

119
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,280
when you do your work you are going to

120
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,879
make mistakes at some point and this is

121
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,040
probably what gets in the news of

122
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,200
the spy news let's say

123
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,799
but on the other hand also probably all

124
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,879
of us know that when you work i don't

125
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,760
like probably 90 95 of your time you do

126
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
your job right nothing goes wrong so

127
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,439
that means what we see is not even the

128
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,879
tip of the iceberg it's like probably

129
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,599
the

130
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,519
the snow that is getting blown on the

131
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,879
tip of the iceberg

132
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,480
this is what we see when we are reading

133
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,400
about espionage stories still it's

134
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,840
pretty interesting but keep that in mind

135
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,160
that what we see is a very tiny portion

136
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,079
of what's happening out there

137
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,320
and you see that emerging cyber

138
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,639
and espionage since like in the case of

139
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,080
djs and other cases i'm going to be

140
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,600
talking about

141
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,919
there is a very strong relation like for

142
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,199
nation states what they care about is

143
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,560
the outcome

144
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,479
and in many cases we have to combine

145
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,320
multiple disciplines to get to that

146
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,680
outcome so

147
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,919
we have to be aware of both worlds it is

148
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,120
not just

149
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,840
cyber espionage

150
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,639
now as you can imagine probably you saw

151
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,840
in the previous slide that working at

152
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,440
booting.com so

153
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,120
very unrelated topics this is my

154
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,720
personal research it has nothing to do

155
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,400
with my employers so

156
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,040
just be aware you have it's all personal

157
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,800
stuff and i will also not accept

158
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,320
questions for my employer since i'm not

159
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,080
presenting anything related to

160
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,960
booking.com here

161
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,080
okay so starting the first i will start

162
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,600
with the assumptions that i had for

163
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,520
making this presentation then i will go

164
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,360
to the private sector since especially

165
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,120
the last few years we hear like

166
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,560
since i'm doing the spy news i know

167
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,160
every other week we have some news about

168
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
nsf group international group is not the

169
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,840
only company that's doing that and it's

170
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,600
not the only company that's offering

171
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,960
services

172
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,280
that are related to nation states

173
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,800
once we cover the private sector i'm

174
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,960
going to go to the main area with the

175
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,320
public sector

176
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,240
and then some key takeaways so the aim

177
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,400
of this presentation is mostly to give

178
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
everyone food for thought and raise a

179
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,759
little bit the awareness of what's

180
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,199
happening that yeah it's not only

181
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,800
fishing that we hear every day i'm not

182
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,240
saying fishing is not happening i'm just

183
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,280
saying there are other things that

184
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,160
happen

185
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,039
that

186
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,320
we kind of ignore

187
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,759
so on the assumptions the first one is

188
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,800
that uh

189
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,320
all of the big apts that they

190
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,639
historically we have been very impressed

191
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,639
on how they did their operations

192
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,919
probably they never stopped doing

193
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,600
operations we just

194
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,400
stopped seeing those operations

195
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,000
the second one is that the not all

196
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,319
nation states are made equal and you can

197
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,639
probably imagine that when you have

198
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,319
organizations like a

199
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,319
russian gru

200
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,039
thousands of people a lot of resources

201
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,479
then you have other countries like very

202
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,840
small countries but maybe the whole

203
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,600
population is like two three million

204
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,039
apparently they will not have the same

205
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,199
capabilities and it will also not have

206
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,759
the same resources then we have agencies

207
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,759
like for example in the us that they are

208
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,199
having a global focus they want to know

209
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,720
what's happening all over the world well

210
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,400
you have other agents another place that

211
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,800
they only care about the regional space

212
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,360
so not all nation states are made equal

213
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,840
both on resourcing and capabilities

214
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,199
vary a lot

215
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,960
then what i'm assuming that you are all

216
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,400
here and also the important in the live

217
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,440
stream

218
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,840
because you are interested in this kind

219
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,600
of topic that you understand facing it

220
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,199
does happen it's

221
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,120
really high volume but there are other

222
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,479
things that might be happening out there

223
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,759
and you might want to be protected

224
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,680
against them especially if your threat

225
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,000
model involves protecting against nation

226
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,960
state

227
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,919
level threat actors

228
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,120
and lastly

229
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,880
we have some anecdotal evidence of this

230
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,400
one that nation states learn from their

231
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,080
mistakes but it's really hard to say

232
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,840
that conclusively for all of the nation

233
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,720
state actors for instance in the vault

234
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,800
seven in uh wikileaks

235
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,720
there is a wiki page that it was from

236
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,800
the cia and then there there is even a

237
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
full page when kaspersky managed to

238
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,160
attribute a lot of their activity to the

239
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,000
acquisition group where they are doing a

240
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,280
retrospective and they are looking to

241
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,960
okay what could we fix to avoid those

242
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,400
mistakes in the future we should change

243
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,759
this this and that it's a pretty

244
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,560
interesting read to go through that but

245
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
again that is one instance

246
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,160
most likely this is what happened in

247
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,680
other agencies as well

248
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,880
and we can also see that a little bit

249
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,240
from the development of the implants

250
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,319
that it changed over time and the evolve

251
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,120
so

252
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
most likely when we release some

253
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,879
research to the world that research is

254
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,240
going to be received also from those

255
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,680
nation state actors and they will take

256
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,360
steps to make sure

257
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,639
that they are going to fix those issues

258
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,199
in the future

259
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,400
okay so moving to the private sector

260
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
the main three questions so that again

261
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,080
this mostly make sure we all speak the

262
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,440
same language of what we mean when we

263
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,560
say that

264
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,400
why do they exist

265
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,319
what are they targeting and how big of a

266
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,000
market is it

267
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,280
the first one is pretty simple

268
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,120
considering the assumption they exist

269
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,440
because there is a need for that not all

270
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,039
of the countries have the capacity to

271
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,958
build all of these things of their own

272
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,719
not all of them have the knowledge and

273
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,399
experience to develop those things so

274
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,919
they have to rely on somebody else and

275
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,479
this is why the private sector provides

276
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,919
almost anything you can imagine to

277
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,599
intelligence agencies

278
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,880
however

279
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
here for the sake of presentation i have

280
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,920
to

281
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,600
let's say limit it down and put in some

282
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,560
package

283
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,399
i know this is not conclusive but i try

284
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,320
to put that in three areas and i'm going

285
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,839
to cover them the first is

286
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,160
infrastructure level signals intelligent

287
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,600
solutions

288
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,640
that are covering things like

289
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,880
telecommunication providers isps and so

290
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,680
on

291
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,080
then specialized seeking services let's

292
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,760
say vulnerability research reverse

293
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,360
engineering and so on

294
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,800
and lastly

295
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,040
tooling to be able to provide small

296
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,399
groups of people so we're talking about

297
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,480
either individuals so either maybe

298
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,640
dozens of hundreds of people maybe a

299
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,160
couple of thousands but not anything

300
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,440
beyond that

301
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,279
there are way way more things i'm very

302
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,600
happy to discuss them afterwards

303
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
yeah i even have an inventory in my blog

304
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,680
with lots of these companies that are

305
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,120
offering the offensive cyber

306
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,519
capabilities i think it's like 140 that

307
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,279
they have so far so it is not just an

308
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,959
iso group

309
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,040
and yeah that leads us also to how big

310
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,959
of a market is it

311
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,519
it's a multi-billion

312
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,040
dollar industry and the reason is this

313
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,320
and they are offering anything you can

314
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,600
imagine from

315
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,000
telecommunication level solutions all

316
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,959
the way to zero days then very tailored

317
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,279
solutions for their customers

318
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,120
most of the information we have is from

319
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,959
leaked contracts that leak over time for

320
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,760
instance uh it was i think last month

321
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,279
that we had a contract click from intel

322
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,800
alexa that was an 8 million contract

323
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,480
last the month before that we had one

324
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,399
from the thai cover government a

325
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,240
contract agenda costly so from time time

326
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,160
we get to see

327
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,399
how how much those solutions cost so we

328
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,120
can make an estimate i can guarantee you

329
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,399
you will never see anything that is

330
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,680
below a million

331
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,600
like i have never seen any contract that

332
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,360
is cheaper than that

333
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,200
and the interesting part is that here is

334
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,279
a very tiny subset as i mentioned there

335
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,720
are hundreds of companies like that you

336
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,560
might recognize some of them so i don't

337
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,519
want to blame any of them they're

338
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,120
literally offering a service i'm not

339
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,800
saying anything against those companies

340
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,640
i'm just saying it's a huge market those

341
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
are some of the bigger names out there

342
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,880
and it is heavily based on trust and

343
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,800
professional relationships

344
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,240
here is an interesting exercise if you

345
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,399
want to do that pick any of the big

346
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,320
companies around this space you can even

347
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,880
go to my blog 140 of them

348
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,040
and then see the people that work there

349
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,360
just go do some oh center them you will

350
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,600
see people that are marketing on sales

351
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
and so on most of them

352
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,200
come from the government sector and then

353
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,279
they switch to the private sector

354
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,360
and this is cheap because a lot of them

355
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,959
are heavily based on having these

356
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,040
translations like you couldn't imagine

357
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
intelligence agencies going in the wild

358
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,519
and luckily asking hey i want to buy a

359
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,760
zero they just reach out to me they need

360
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,440
to have those relationships

361
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,959
and of course there are some conferences

362
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,560
that are closed for this kind of

363
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,880
audience that the intelligence agents

364
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,320
and these companies are going together

365
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,600
and they are presenting the tools but

366
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,120
most of the time it is

367
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,320
heavily based on professional

368
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,160
relationships and trust

369
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,079
also in some countries

370
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,440
they are not even allowed to have an

371
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,880
online presence if you want to sell the

372
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,480
service to a government agency you are

373
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
not allowed to have a website like a

374
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,959
domain nothing at all you you should not

375
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,560
exist on the web

376
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,920
that probably also gives you an idea

377
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,079
what we see again is a very tiny portion

378
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,680
of everything that's out there on these

379
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,079
companies

380
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
okay so now probably will unders have

381
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,959
the same understanding of what i mean

382
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,320
when i say private sector in this

383
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,600
context

384
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,720
so let's go a little bit on the

385
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,079
infrastructure level which i would say

386
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,920
is the most innocent because you can

387
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,240
find tons of information about this for

388
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,880
what i'm going to cover here but still

389
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,120
it's not very well covered topic that's

390
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,440
the ali system the lawful interception

391
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,560
systems

392
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,279
so

393
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,519
every country that they have research

394
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,880
has these things installing their

395
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,720
telecommunication providers of course

396
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,320
including this country but

397
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,480
like any country that i i have a

398
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,920
research center that is a lot of them

399
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,040
like more than 20 30 countries

400
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,959
how they work is pretty simple they

401
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,959
demand by law the telecommunication

402
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,639
providers to install them in their

403
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,720
networks they are tapping on the network

404
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,480
traffic and then through a legal process

405
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,079
that is different per country they are

406
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,360
allowed to

407
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,000
issue an li request which means for that

408
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,680
person we want to intercept everything

409
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,880
that they are doing

410
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,720
and here is something that is not widely

411
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,839
communicated this is not

412
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,279
intercepting only voice which is what

413
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,360
you'd assume like okay phone calls like

414
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,279
wiretapping traditionally it's

415
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,040
intercepting anything that this

416
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,399
telecommunication

417
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,160
provider has access to including data

418
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,160
including metadata including

419
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,399
in some cases they have abilities to

420
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,320
track sessions so you can build sessions

421
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,639
from so you have have easier experience

422
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,800
browsing the collect information

423
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,680
um

424
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,880
they all support next-generation

425
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,720
networks nowadays so

426
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,639
many different capabilities and that

427
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,800
exists everywhere

428
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,720
you could say okay i trust my government

429
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,600
i will never abuse this technology maybe

430
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,200
it depends

431
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
um but then there are other versions of

432
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,399
this one so there are many different

433
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,079
models out there and the one that you

434
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,760
might hear if you start looking to that

435
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,680
is the russian version of it called

436
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,240
storm system for operative for operative

437
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,160
investigative activities

438
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,680
technical speaking is

439
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,000
almost identical to what we call in the

440
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,760
west lawful interception there are

441
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,519
really minor differences and there are a

442
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,120
few others as well but i mentioned just

443
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,480
those two because we start looking to

444
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,760
those two

445
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,040
you will get into a rabbit hole and

446
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,959
you'll find a lot of information

447
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,320
especially actually the russian

448
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,480
initially was built for the fsb the

449
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,160
federal security service in russia so

450
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,480
that they can use it for investigations

451
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,240
but then they started also the companies

452
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,920
that build it also selling it outside to

453
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,800
other company other countries that are

454
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,839
let's say

455
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,720
friendly to russia

456
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,160
then we have another part of the private

457
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,320
sector that it is not so

458
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,920
innocent let's say

459
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,680
i use this example because it is easy to

460
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,120
find information about it but there are

461
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,199
many similar products out there

462
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,760
it is from finfisher a product that they

463
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,440
call thin isp

464
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,199
and again a government can install it to

465
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,360
telecommunication providers and what it

466
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,440
does is similar to the lawful

467
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,040
interception in terms of wiretapping the

468
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,680
traffic but it's online and can also

469
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,600
inject traffic so it can do many

470
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,720
individual attacks and you might be

471
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,480
asking yourself why would someone do

472
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,160
that well because this way you can

473
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,399
compromise systems almost transparently

474
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,360
you can

475
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,399
inject exploits in a session of a person

476
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,920
and they will never even know that this

477
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,040
happened

478
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,959
again from country to country it heavily

479
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,760
depends on how those are used or abused

480
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,839
there are entire legal frameworks around

481
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,560
those but as with any law

482
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,399
yeah and the intelligence agencies that

483
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,800
operate in this really gray area

484
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,399
there are countries that are pretty

485
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,600
strict on how they operate them and

486
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,120
countries that are a little bit more

487
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,480
relaxed

488
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,440
on how they use them

489
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
so some considerations for

490
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,360
those systems the infrastructure level

491
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,199
seeking solutions

492
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,959
first of all we all think that hey i

493
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,240
fully trust my government they will

494
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,000
never do anything bad with those things

495
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,199
it doesn't matter that they have them

496
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,160
installed

497
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,000
well okay but what happens when you

498
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,519
travel somewhere else what happens when

499
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,880
you talk to someone in another country

500
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,839
or your traffic their communication goes

501
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,600
there what happens if your internet for

502
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,279
whatever reason is routed through

503
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,279
another country

504
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,720
it is not only your country you have to

505
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,040
be careful of there are other players in

506
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,160
this

507
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
and the another area is that

508
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,079
you now imagine you are a nation state

509
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,519
actor you're in a signals intelligence

510
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,560
agency

511
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,079
it could be really awesome having access

512
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,519
to a foreign country's lawful

513
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,959
interception system

514
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,480
pretty cool right you would have like

515
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,920
all your interception already in place

516
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,759
you just have to enable and start spying

517
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,519
on people

518
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,800
and the last

519
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,199
actually on this one yeah

520
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,160
it did happen in 2004 the us did exactly

521
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,240
that in vodafone in greece

522
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,360
and

523
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,360
the vodafone at that point was using a

524
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,120
system from erickson for lawful

525
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,920
interception and the nsa had developed a

526
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,360
rootkit using the language of that

527
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,199
system that was called plex

528
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,120
and you like i just the question is how

529
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,040
they managed to install it well here's

530
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,560
where we go back to the combination they

531
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,839
recruited a network engineer working in

532
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,160
vodafone the most uh let's say sad part

533
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,680
of the story is that when this leaked

534
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,279
and became a scandal and that happened

535
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,800
because the olympic games were happening

536
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,240
in general when you have international

537
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,480
events like a spy magnet you have lots

538
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,839
of people going there and of course by

539
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,600
agencies have an excellent opportunity

540
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,320
to reach all of those people at once

541
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,680
but the sad part of this story is that

542
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,399
that

543
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,079
engineer was

544
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:56,959
found

545
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,440
he committed suicide at least this was

546
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,639
the initial

547
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,800
assessment when this scandal became

548
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,599
public but later on i think it was 2017

549
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,439
or 18 the court decided that was a

550
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,839
murder

551
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,559
so again it is this where you see the

552
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,240
cyber meeting

553
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,959
the real world

554
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,760
okay but that is like almost 20 years

555
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,919
ago an isolated incident we could say

556
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,720
but when snowden did his leaks

557
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,640
we found this lideck this is from the

558
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,039
nsa and says exploiting foreign lawful

559
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,200
intercept round table

560
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,559
you can check out the slide deck if you

561
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,080
want it's a public on the internet i

562
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,760
think the intercept linked it

563
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,640
and

564
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,320
in there it has like a whole inventory

565
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,799
of like 10 12 countries that the nsa was

566
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,559
doing exactly the same thing so it

567
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,200
wasn't just greece

568
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,039
another thing to remember even if your

569
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,200
country doesn't abuse

570
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,559
the systems they have maybe some other

571
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,360
countries abusing them for them

572
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,160
and the last part i mentioned about the

573
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,720
thin isp or similar products that can

574
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,880
many in the middle and inject traffic

575
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,600
now

576
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,120
you might say okay yeah they cannot

577
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,960
inject anything like we have https we

578
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,360
have a like a perfect trust a perfect

579
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,200
secrecy and everything is working nicely

580
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,919
based on most statistics only 89 percent

581
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,720
of the internet traffic is https and now

582
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,080
think for yourself like in the last

583
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,360
couple of months didn't you have that

584
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,480
time that you

585
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,080
browsing something or you did it up in a

586
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,760
not secure site

587
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,000
now if you were part in the target list

588
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,360
that's the only time that was needed

589
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,200
they could inject in that http response

590
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,520
and exploit it and boom they have access

591
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,280
to your device that's it

592
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,559
and um

593
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,160
actually from snowden's click we even

594
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,000
know that they were building automation

595
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,679
around this thing so they didn't they

596
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,960
were not doing these things manually

597
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,480
they would just have the target list and

598
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,400
the moment they were able to

599
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,840
get some unencrypted connection of

600
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
course it was far easier back then they

601
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,600
were immediately injecting the exploit

602
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,760
and it was getting back to the system to

603
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,080
feed all of the data back to the nsa so

604
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,080
it wasn't like a human doing that was

605
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,720
full automated

606
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,360
so okay that was pretty saddening

607
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,160
if opponent part so what can we do

608
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,080
first of all let's accept that we all

609
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,880
operate in very hostile networks

610
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,360
the second part is encrypt everything

611
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,440
and not just enable encryption but

612
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,799
research what are you doing like doesn't

613
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,160
make sense for what you're trying to

614
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,200
encrypt

615
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,080
and

616
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,160
yeah don't rely on the defaults and the

617
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,520
last part if you if you have any

618
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,960
researchers here that are going to look

619
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,039
into that look at the network-based

620
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,640
attacks like make the middle tampering

621
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,880
with network packets can you find any

622
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,320
injections

623
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,520
there are lots of areas that you can

624
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,200
look into that level like the network

625
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,840
level of

626
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,280
exploitation then we have the more

627
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,640
straightforward part of the private

628
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,240
sector that the offering service is like

629
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,120
okay

630
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,960
can't you find a zero day in the target

631
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,640
platform can you build as an exploit for

632
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,480
this vulnerability that we have

633
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,200
or we got this to exploit but we don't

634
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,640
know how to make them work in a nice

635
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,039
production already exploit chain

636
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:55,840
or

637
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,679
we have this a very obscure device that

638
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,000
we try to hack because of x

639
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,080
adversary of ours is using can you help

640
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,160
us reverse engineer it and see how it

641
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
works or we managed to capture this

642
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,679
malware and we want to reuse it for our

643
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,360
own purpose can you help us figure out

644
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,120
how to make it work so those are very

645
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,919
common scenarios in this space

646
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,039
and

647
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,960
here again we have to consider could we

648
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,799
do anything around this to protect our

649
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,559
hardware and software

650
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,080
and that goes back to a lot of the talks

651
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,000
that also happened uh today and

652
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,760
yesterday about ethical hacking how can

653
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,520
we make ethical hutting more more

654
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,480
appealing and reverse engineering

655
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,960
adopted in a wider way so that people

656
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,520
don't have to go to that route and we

657
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,720
reduce

658
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,520
the

659
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,159
the amount of let's say good

660
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,600
evaluability researchers the reverse

661
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,159
engineers that those companies get

662
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,159
some considerations and uh

663
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,679
how can we defend adjustments again

664
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,840
encouraging ethical hacking we should

665
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,440
not be assuming that anything we buy is

666
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,679
secure no device should be assumed that

667
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,360
it's secured because someone said so or

668
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,840
it has a stamp of some sort unless you

669
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,520
have stamps like the ones you see there

670
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,840
which like it has been reviewed by the

671
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,280
german intelligence the swedish

672
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,880
intelligence the european union

673
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,960
intelligence but i guarantee you most of

674
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,360
things that we buy as let's say private

675
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,880
companies they will not have the stamp

676
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,440
synergies

677
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,880
and um yeah the other thing is that the

678
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,480
maybe we should switch our focus and

679
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,000
instead of trying to

680
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,679
to protect the whole platform can we

681
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,679
protect the whatever is running on the

682
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:24,559
platform

683
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,280
the

684
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,320
workload

685
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,679
the thing about this let's say the

686
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,280
network's compromised the platform might

687
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,799
be compromised

688
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,080
how can we make sure that whatever we

689
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,760
deployed in that system

690
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,440
is not getting tampered and no one is

691
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
touching it in any way or form because

692
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,799
if we do that we don't really care about

693
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,640
anything else we can assume everything

694
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,720
else is compromised that attached a

695
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,960
little bit on the zero uh zero trash

696
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,720
architecture which is like a big thing

697
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,840
nowadays but

698
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,600
it's a nice consideration to think of it

699
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,039
this way

700
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,039
and another area is if you have

701
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,919
especially in the ocean enthusiast is

702
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,360
to look around what all of those

703
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
companies are looking for when they are

704
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,440
hiring people for instance we have one

705
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,799
of the let's say

706
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,400
very well known companies that are

707
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,840
acquiring zero days for nation stages

708
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,280
that are from time time they put things

709
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,120
like that it says we're temporarily

710
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,520
doubling our bounty for chrome chains

711
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
remote code execution and sandboxes

712
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,080
shape to 1 million

713
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,919
well how you can read this is like there

714
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,520
is a customer out there in nation state

715
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,679
that pays a lot of money for this

716
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,520
and in some cases they are saying things

717
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,200
like that for very specific software and

718
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,120
hardware which means researchers maybe

719
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,320
we should

720
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
shift our focus there and see okay do we

721
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,840
see any active exploitation do we see

722
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,200
anything going in the wild around the

723
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,400
space

724
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,159
and even more interesting is job

725
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,120
listings

726
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,480
here is another one i removed the name

727
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,000
of the company apparently because it is

728
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
not just a single companies all of those

729
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,440
that are doing that so

730
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,960
this is why i really don't like all of

731
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,480
that blaming a single company whether

732
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,520
this is

733
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,240
i'm not going to create energies so if

734
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,919
you read this like it looks like normal

735
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,520
advertisement let's highlight a few

736
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,720
things i will read them for you because

737
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,360
they are tiny probably the top says

738
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,679
possess an active top secret sensitive

739
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,840
compartment information clearance or

740
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,400
above or an ability to update a

741
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
clearance the second one is experience

742
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,159
performing vulnerability recent and

743
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,679
exploit development for desktop and

744
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,440
mobile and the third thing i have

745
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,760
highlighted is ability to take unknown

746
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,240
hardware and or software systems from

747
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,880
initial trios to reconstruction of

748
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,400
system architecture through reverse

749
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,280
engineering efforts so this is a nice

750
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,440
advertisement how i read it is that

751
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,039
they want someone to be embedded in a

752
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,120
u.s government agency give them some

753
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,640
obsture hardware

754
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,080
and try to find a way to hack it

755
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,360
again it can give you a lot of

756
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,799
indication especially some listings are

757
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,320
even more detailed than that on what

758
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,960
they are looking for

759
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,520
okay now we'll go to the probably the

760
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,280
most popular area that is all over the

761
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,360
news exploitation frameworks there are

762
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,679
so many out there apart from pegasus i

763
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,960
just named a few and added a few

764
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,559
screenshots of some of them

765
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,120
now what is the selling point of those

766
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,280
it is at the point the click solution

767
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,880
the operators that buy them they don't

768
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,240
need to know almost anything they go

769
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,640
through a very minimal training a few

770
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,960
hours of training and then they learn

771
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,640
how to use it

772
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,640
those things basically they say i want

773
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,799
to hack this person here is the mobile

774
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,559
phone number and

775
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,960
if it is a more if let's say it's a zero

776
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,640
click they don't do they don't need to

777
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,080
do anything else if it's in a one-click

778
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,840
exploit they might need to add like okay

779
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,120
what message do you want to send to that

780
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,159
person

781
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,679
and everything else is happening on the

782
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,240
background on the platform

783
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,840
you can realize that

784
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,919
this has a very specific market

785
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,440
for instance

786
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,520
let's say really huge agencies like i

787
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,000
mentioned like the gru or the nsa in the

788
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,799
us

789
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,400
they probably care more about the

790
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,840
exploits that are being used rather than

791
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,120
the platform because they probably have

792
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,200
way better solutions than that but when

793
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,720
you're talking about smaller urgencies

794
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,840
that they don't have this capability

795
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,120
they would love to have something like

796
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,000
that

797
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,520
how those are charged typically is like

798
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,880
a cost for the platform per year

799
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,279
subscription plus additional module for

800
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,520
anything that people buy per usage for

801
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,720
instance you could say okay i want to

802
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,400
have a zero day for

803
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,120
ios okay it's going to be plus that

804
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,440
amount of money per 100 users

805
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,760
and and so on and because of that they

806
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,240
are very limited in use in terms of

807
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,840
you cannot use that to spy like in a

808
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,760
whole country you can use this by dozens

809
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,559
people hundreds maybe thousands but

810
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,799
after that it's not something beyond

811
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,080
that space

812
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,480
again all of them are a multi-million

813
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,640
subscription fees and series interest

814
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,840
part almost all of them are cloud-based

815
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,360
nowadays so you if you look carefully

816
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,640
you might be able to find some of those

817
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,120
in the wild

818
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,240
now what we need to think about from our

819
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,320
side is that uh yeah those are four

820
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,679
small groups of people they are not for

821
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,919
anything else that uh almost all known

822
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,520
case that we have like anything from

823
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,159
citizen lab amnesty international from

824
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,240
uh washington was like there are lots of

825
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,080
things that have happened over the last

826
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,520
just this year

827
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,279
they involved some zero day either one

828
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,760
click or zero click which again shows

829
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,919
there were a few very very few cases

830
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,240
that was like traditional fishing but

831
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,919
that's the exception i don't have the

832
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,360
exact number but

833
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,400
it is

834
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
way less than ten percent that it was

835
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,000
facing almost everything was zero days

836
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,760
and the other thing is that a lot of

837
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,039
people get

838
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,440
really obsessed with ios however the top

839
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,039
target is android in all of those

840
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,240
platforms if you see what's the top

841
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,240
demand is android apparently because

842
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,480
more people use android but again it is

843
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,279
not ios

844
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,840
so what can we do as defenders first of

845
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,960
all awareness training and teach people

846
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,039
operational security personal security

847
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,720
measures like when to use their phone

848
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,640
when not use their phone

849
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,480
what they can say in their phone where

850
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,400
they cannot say on their phone all of

851
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,360
these things

852
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,440
and of course uh there are a lot of

853
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,400
things that we could do on the

854
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,320
protection side like for that thing to

855
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,000
work on the phone think of it yeah it

856
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,159
could be a root hit it with kite itself

857
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,279
but still

858
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,279
it will need to do some operations

859
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,279
can we see those operations for instance

860
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,279
like one thing that's usually referenced

861
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,279
the battery lifetime do we see a change

862
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,279
in that another one that i find more

863
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,080
efficient is the data usage those things

864
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,159
need to accelerate a lot of data so that

865
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,919
should be visible somewhere

866
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,760
also if you have some sort of wi-fi

867
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,440
interception and your phone is using

868
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,840
wi-fi and then it's you need to reach

869
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,840
out command control servers to send data

870
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
you might be able to capture those

871
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,080
things

872
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,600
and yeah as i mentioned those are

873
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,279
cloud-based so with a little bit of

874
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,880
research you might be able to find them

875
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,279
online

876
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,919
okay now move to the public sector and

877
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,520
does anyone know this person andrew

878
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,400
busamante i'm a fan of him

879
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,760
no okay

880
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,000
so he's a recently retired cia

881
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,240
clandestine service officer and he's

882
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,840
doing lots of different interviews and

883
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,400
podcasts so i took two quotes from him

884
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,080
from two different podcasts here so the

885
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,520
first one is this one

886
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,279
the us military has something called

887
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,760
cyber command their job is sole cyber

888
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,080
warfare so not only does it happen not

889
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,919
only does it happen frequently but it

890
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,919
happens frequently and nobody even knows

891
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,159
it's happening that's what makes really

892
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,240
professional intelligence work happen

893
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,520
that's why we call it clandestine

894
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,720
going back to what i mentioned the

895
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,320
meeting about what we see in the news

896
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,840
it's a nice addition to that and the

897
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,399
second quote is about the targeting side

898
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,000
that we're talking here that once you

899
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,480
become an intentional target then your

900
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,200
security apparatus they will create a

901
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,320
dedicated customized way a vector of

902
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,919
attacking your specific security

903
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,480
apparatus and because security is always

904
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,720
after there is the leading advantage and

905
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,640
the trailing advantage when when it

906
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,120
comes to attacks the leader always has

907
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,720
the advantage because they have to

908
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,880
create the attack before anybody else

909
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,640
can create a way to protect against the

910
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,919
attack

911
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,840
i guess it's common sense but still i

912
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,679
found an easy transition from the

913
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,240
private sector to the public sector and

914
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,679
the connection to what we see in the

915
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,919
news

916
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,399
so public sector is relatively see

917
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,840
easy why it exists to inform the

918
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,440
government and military of what are the

919
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,399
threats

920
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,559
and there is another nice port cast here

921
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,039
from my former jsoc member talking with

922
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,320
a former military intelligence analyst

923
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,919
that in during the discussion they

924
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,600
estimated that from their side that it

925
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,200
was well their site was killing

926
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,000
terrorists so it was a very nice area in

927
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,399
the intelligent side but still 70

928
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,559
percent roughly of the actual

929
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,760
actionable intelligence that we're

930
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,200
getting it goes from signals

931
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,399
intelligence

932
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,240
and that also explains why all the

933
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,919
governments are putting so much effort

934
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,120
there

935
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
since it provides value

936
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,640
compared to compared to other

937
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,720
disciplines this is also why we see so

938
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,559
many cyber activity because cyber falls

939
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,720
into sigint i will explain that shortly

940
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,880
so what are they targeting anything of

941
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,960
potential interest to that specific

942
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,200
government or military and this is why

943
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
monitoring geopolitical news matters if

944
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,799
let's say a politician comes out and

945
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,880
says oh really disagree with that

946
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,960
government's position and we're going to

947
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,200
take steps against it i can guarantee

948
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,559
you in the background intelligence is

949
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,960
already working on that

950
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,440
and there is also a let's say slightly

951
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,600
difference here of culture change

952
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,279
especially in the last 10 years before

953
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,720
it was really like that like very

954
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,399
targeted and specific

955
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,720
what we see in the last year is that the

956
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,919
many governments especially in the

957
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,919
european union because another place was

958
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,480
already happening uh some degree they

959
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,399
started moving more to okay let's

960
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,240
collect everything and then filter from

961
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,880
that and i will give just a few examples

962
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,039
since we have limited time

963
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,720
for instance just last week in the

964
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,840
netherlands the regulator of the second

965
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,159
agencies of another of the netherlands

966
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,279
resigned

967
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,520
because his name is a bird hubert if you

968
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,200
want to check it out because he said

969
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,919
that

970
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,000
there is a push from the agency to tap

971
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,760
on all of the traffic all of the

972
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,440
internet traffic of the netherlands and

973
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,200
then filter out whatever they see as

974
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,000
interested based on an ai and

975
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,320
smart let's say rules that they filter

976
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,559
out whatever they consider relevant and

977
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,720
of course this is not let's say the best

978
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,440
approach but um yeah this is why he

979
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,640
resigned because there is a push for

980
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,679
that

981
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,520
similarly in germany it was 2018 i think

982
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,679
that the bnd the german intelligence got

983
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,440
access to the frankfurt internet

984
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,520
exchange to do the same thing

985
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,399
and

986
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:09,039
well very recently also in the last year

987
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,840
or so in denmark we had the military

988
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,360
intelligence scandal that came out with

989
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,679
the nsa that i'm not going to the

990
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,200
scandal if it was a scandal or not the

991
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,880
scandal or it was a secret agreement or

992
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,799
whatever but the important part is that

993
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,080
through that we also learned that they

994
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,880
had full tap on all of the traffic of

995
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,159
denmark and they were using that to

996
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,720
to collect intelligence

997
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,960
and how big of a domain is this uh it

998
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,480
goes back to i mentioned not all of the

999
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,080
apts are equal

1000
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,600
it really depends on what they are after

1001
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,679
if you are talking about someone like

1002
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,840
the u.s or china that they want to have

1003
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,080
global reach of course they will have

1004
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,919
way more of these things happening

1005
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,679
compared to if you talk to a smaller

1006
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,919
country they don't like a small country

1007
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,799
let's say well in india we understand

1008
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,240
like small countries that may care about

1009
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,600
what's happening in the region and not

1010
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,320
so much anything outside of that so that

1011
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,200
heavily depends and uh yeah just give an

1012
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,360
explanation hopefully that shows up yeah

1013
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,880
with the colors

1014
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,679
this is like a purely semantics in the

1015
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,039
practice doesn't mean that much but

1016
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,799
signals intelligence in the western

1017
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,279
world typically we split it to elite

1018
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,799
which electronic intelligence you can

1019
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,399
think of it like emissions of device

1020
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,679
like let's say you have a spy plane

1021
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,760
flying over and they can identify oh

1022
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,679
this is a tank of that version oh this

1023
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,080
is an anti-aircraft system this is that

1024
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,679
and then you have the communication

1025
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,200
intelligence which what which are about

1026
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,880
which is anything that has to do with

1027
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
transferring information

1028
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,120
and of course computers fall into that

1029
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,120
so we have like what i mentioned that is

1030
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,960
called bulk collection or in the new

1031
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,240
smart surveillance so the things that

1032
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,080
look like wiretap everything

1033
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,200
then we have

1034
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,120
what is called international cno

1035
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,880
computer network operations so that we

1036
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,679
can

1037
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,000
well it's network operations we're using

1038
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,799
computers and the two areas that we hear

1039
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,880
about in this talk is the cna computer

1040
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,840
network attacks and those are

1041
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,600
destructive or disruptive operations

1042
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,279
think about let's say nation say doing a

1043
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,799
denial of service in another country's

1044
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,600
communication network and actually

1045
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,919
in

1046
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:07,279
2018 or 19 blackberry threat

1047
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,799
intelligence did the black hat talk that

1048
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,799
they found the ddos botnet that belonged

1049
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,279
to the chinese government so

1050
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,039
also governments do the u.s it's not

1051
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,799
just

1052
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:17,919
activists

1053
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:18,559
and

1054
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,640
the second part is the cne computer

1055
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,159
network exploitation which is what we

1056
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,760
can bundle ask what most of us

1057
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,200
understand us hatching is how do you

1058
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,880
exploit computer systems to get access

1059
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,840
into them

1060
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,360
and then you have the more traditional

1061
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,360
voice interception like intercepting

1062
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,760
mobile phones uh traditional phone lines

1063
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,679
and so on so this is the space that we

1064
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,440
are moving in this talk the common

1065
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,080
second part

1066
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,600
okay so

1067
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,240
the bread and butter of second agencies

1068
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,600
is cryptology

1069
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,279
encryptology is the combination you have

1070
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,600
cryptography encrypt analysis making

1071
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,320
crypto and breaking crypto

1072
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,120
so

1073
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,799
has anyone ever heard hearing those

1074
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,960
things firefly key exchange high

1075
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,640
assurance internet protocol and crypto

1076
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,320
and rush back

1077
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,799
encryption anyone

1078
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:03,600
okay

1079
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,360
well probably even if you did you might

1080
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,360
not feel comfortable saying that

1081
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,359
so those are um

1082
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,760
encryption algorithms used today

1083
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,159
by nation states that are classified and

1084
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,918
that completely trusts is the whole

1085
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,359
point that we have the cryptograph has

1086
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,639
to be public and everyone needs to know

1087
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,639
everything about well not if you're a

1088
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,679
government

1089
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,040
if you're a government everything you

1090
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,359
use is classified and it's not publicly

1091
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,280
knowledge and those are some that you

1092
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,879
might be able to find some information

1093
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,079
in the wild

1094
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,839
but there are many more that there is no

1095
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,520
information out there

1096
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,520
why is this happening oh actually before

1097
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,000
we go there did you know that gchq had

1098
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,079
independently discovered public geo

1099
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,560
encryption asymmetric cryptography but

1100
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,960
they kept it a secret

1101
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,119
anyone okay a few people yeah it's a

1102
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,440
pretty interesting story

1103
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,960
it was discovered roughly the same time

1104
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,320
but they kept the secret because they

1105
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,679
thought it's such a big advantage

1106
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,960
compared to the adversaries that they

1107
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,320
don't want anyone else to use it so they

1108
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,240
can spy on people but they cannot get

1109
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,480
spied upon and this goes a little bit on

1110
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,000
why governments decide to use their own

1111
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,800
things

1112
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,720
is it because this way they can let's

1113
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,880
say they find the flow in some those

1114
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,960
first of all those are not like entirely

1115
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,560
new algorithms that have nothing to do

1116
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,480
with what's used they are typically

1117
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,640
optimized or modified versions of what

1118
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,640
we use

1119
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,800
in the public space in the let's say as

1120
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,640
private people

1121
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,000
so

1122
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,280
what they did let's say they find the

1123
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,280
flow they can immediately fix it on

1124
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,240
their site so they know they're

1125
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,520
protected and then they can start the

1126
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,200
discussion okay should we fix it in the

1127
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,119
actual algorithm maybe we should not

1128
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,200
let's do a third assessment or it could

1129
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,640
be oh like for this specific

1130
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,560
communication system that we have we can

1131
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,160
really optimize the crypto if we do this

1132
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,440
this thing that but if we release it to

1133
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,599
the general public they might find out

1134
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,800
that okay

1135
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,240
this is not the best approach the way

1136
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,920
they do descriptors so okay let's not do

1137
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,200
that so

1138
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,760
it is not like some super sort of it is

1139
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,680
like a big secret for or how they do

1140
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,920
crypto but i mean it is not something

1141
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,240
extraordinary it is optimizing more or

1142
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,839
less what is out there and of course

1143
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:00,960
there might be other things that i'm not

1144
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,119
aware of that are fully customized that

1145
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,800
have nothing to do with anything that no

1146
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,240
they might exist

1147
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,920
this based on open source formation so

1148
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,000
you never know

1149
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,640
i really like this this is the second

1150
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,560
intelligence from australia and their

1151
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,960
motto is literally reveal their secrets

1152
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,800
protect our own

1153
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,240
i found this the best description of why

1154
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,760
cryptology is so important those

1155
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,079
agencies this is later the bread and

1156
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,240
butter not from now even if you go back

1157
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,760
to world war ii this is what those

1158
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,960
agents were established to do

1159
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,200
so going to the modern world what does

1160
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,320
it mean

1161
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,720
again a snowden slide on the top right

1162
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,119
that it is from an office that existed

1163
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,800
back then in the nsa it was called the

1164
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,720
office of target pursuit and the

1165
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,240
specific team that did the presentation

1166
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,119
was called the vpn exploitation team

1167
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,040
pretty self-explanatory the whole

1168
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,200
purpose to pick up vpn solutions find

1169
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,359
flaws and find ways to exploit them so

1170
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,760
that if at any point anyone in the us

1171
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,599
government wanted to hack a system they

1172
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,040
had something already available to use

1173
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,880
that you can see like what they were

1174
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,400
doing is provide vpn vulnerability

1175
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,480
analysis engage network security

1176
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,720
products convey meaningful feedback to

1177
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,800
customer customers anyone that might ask

1178
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,880
them for a hatching solution basically

1179
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,640
develop and sustain exploitation threads

1180
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,079
when possible suggest alternative

1181
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,160
approaches if passive exploitation is

1182
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,520
unrealistic

1183
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,400
and oops

1184
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,280
sorry and of course decrypt the crypt

1185
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,640
decrypt which means if they have only

1186
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,240
find a way

1187
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,079
to bypass some vpn they might be able to

1188
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,079
decrypt the traffic

1189
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,680
the second screenshot that i have is

1190
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,560
from 2014

1191
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,720
from cloudflare that we still don't know

1192
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,320
if it was the nsa behind it which goes

1193
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,079
back to the deniability why those

1194
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,400
agencies do exist to be able to do shady

1195
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,680
things and not being able to easily

1196
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,359
attribute it back to them and if you

1197
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,960
want to research for that just search

1198
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,000
for the

1199
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,560
dual elliptic curve

1200
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,560
deterministic

1201
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,200
random beat generator

1202
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,640
this is what they try to introduce which

1203
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,760
to this day

1204
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,520
it is still unclear if it was a backed

1205
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,960
or not but it seriously looked like a

1206
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,760
bacter from the nsc

1207
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
then we have the biggest case of all

1208
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,079
that was like 50 years of continuous

1209
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,359
back dooring devices the crypto gjs that

1210
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,760
the german bmd with the cia and some

1211
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,160
support from the nsa they acquired a

1212
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,119
vendor that was providing encryptors for

1213
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,400
lots and lots of governments around the

1214
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,280
world

1215
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,440
and they did something super smart they

1216
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,160
were

1217
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,400
picking specific customers and they were

1218
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,839
either changing the manual so they can

1219
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,599
set the device in an insecure manner or

1220
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,359
they were making a slight modification

1221
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,280
that it still looked very very secure

1222
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,359
but they had a way to reverse it and

1223
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,000
break it and they did that from 1950 all

1224
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,839
the way to 2018.

1225
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,920
at some point b and d pulled out of this

1226
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,640
deal but the cia continued on their own

1227
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,400
still a very interesting case

1228
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,640
of the combination of cryptology and

1229
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,000
also

1230
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,400
supply chain attacks

1231
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,720
so what uh what they are doing these

1232
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,480
agencies those are a few examples they

1233
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,960
are doing of course intercepting traffic

1234
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,160
the

1235
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,920
all of the second agents i was able to

1236
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,520
research they have cryptologic units

1237
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,359
that they both verify that the solution

1238
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,720
is secure and also try to break

1239
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,800
solutions of their adversaries

1240
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,119
and um we even now have a few private

1241
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,400
companies that are doing that which is

1242
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,760
great we should have more private

1243
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,119
companies that are picking up solutions

1244
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,280
they try to find flaws in cryptos like

1245
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,119
yesterday there was a nice talk from uh

1246
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,079
unciphered that they do these things uh

1247
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,920
in a different scope because of

1248
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,760
cryptocurrencies but still they try to

1249
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,760
break crypto using

1250
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,200
very traditional methods like what we

1251
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,879
see in this case here

1252
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,480
and some considerations so

1253
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,480
let's assume based on that that hardware

1254
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,160
appliances might not be as secure as

1255
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,320
advertised or we don't know if they are

1256
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,200
secure unless we check them

1257
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,359
also in when you do encryption did you

1258
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,200
just enable whatever is recommended or

1259
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,960
do you do your research what could work

1260
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,160
best for your case for instance

1261
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,839
depending on your data flow your

1262
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,520
hardware on your

1263
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,599
kind of communication

1264
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,119
one type of encryption might be better

1265
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,800
than the other or a cypher sees a

1266
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,720
specific cipher suit or settings in that

1267
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,160
cipher suit

1268
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,839
and the other thing that i'm not sure if

1269
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,760
people take as seriously as they should

1270
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,599
is that encryption is the ultimate

1271
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,040
security control think about it the

1272
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,480
network class is full compromise the

1273
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,560
device is fully compromised someone can

1274
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,480
read everything that we send over

1275
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,440
what can

1276
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,960
protect us well if someone reads

1277
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,160
everything but they cannot understand

1278
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,400
what we're sending

1279
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,200
and

1280
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,280
what should we do about this

1281
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,960
first of all never assume something is

1282
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,520
secure unless you have some assessment i

1283
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,599
know like none of us is sending a

1284
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,440
cryptanalyst expert that can do this

1285
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,760
work but there are some

1286
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,200
trustworthy vendors out there that can

1287
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,960
help in that part

1288
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,240
the other is

1289
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,680
research what you are going to be using

1290
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,280
for crypto

1291
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,040
this the third point is probably the

1292
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,720
most important

1293
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,520
your ways for margin cryptographic

1294
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,880
team the team management for

1295
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,200
cryptographic material should be like

1296
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,880
the most secure thing you have in your

1297
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,880
organization like nothing could even go

1298
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,640
remotely a security

1299
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,839
this is what is achieved to your castle

1300
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,920
and of course governments take this very

1301
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,599
seriously but private companies i'm not

1302
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,160
sure if they are taking it as seriously

1303
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,079
and if people are interested in doing

1304
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,920
research of course finding flaws in

1305
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,079
algorithms is pretty hard unless you

1306
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,280
have a team of cryptanalysis

1307
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,240
mathematicians and computer scientists

1308
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,440
but the finding flaws in the

1309
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,720
implementation is far simpler

1310
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,160
something to consider most of the flaws

1311
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,440
that we have seen so far it's in the

1312
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,520
implementation

1313
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,359
then we have

1314
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:30,960
yeah security appliance that might not

1315
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,040
be so secure so this will be pretty

1316
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,359
quick it's about the leaks that are have

1317
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,520
been out there so vault seven it was

1318
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,800
mostly used by the cia 23 projects were

1319
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,240
leaked and the code floor is widget used

1320
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,760
by the cia

1321
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,440
no references to fishing

1322
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,200
anywhere actually if you search there

1323
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,640
will be like a couple of references but

1324
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,160
if you open them it is not from the

1325
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,680
widget it is a report that they were

1326
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,280
attaching from vendors like crowd strike

1327
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,440
fire and so on so their own content has

1328
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,680
zero facing reference nowhere

1329
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,520
what they have is a lot of

1330
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,440
firmware implants lots of them

1331
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,119
then we go to shadow brochures a few

1332
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,040
years after 2016

1333
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,040
mainly used by the nsa

1334
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,520
zero reference to fishing what they had

1335
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,839
tons of zero days remote code execution

1336
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,000
local privilege escalation lots of zero

1337
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,640
days also many of them for vendor

1338
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,119
appliances specifically network devices

1339
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,720
i listed the top ones that were

1340
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,839
exploited

1341
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,599
and email gateways

1342
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,280
lots of those

1343
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,599
again areas that the to the best of my

1344
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,680
knowledge most companies are really not

1345
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,040
really putting a lot of attention on

1346
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,480
security

1347
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,400
because we assume we buy something and

1348
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,040
this is secure

1349
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,280
and snowden leaks that it is uh the

1350
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,200
harder to search because it is documents

1351
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,839
it is a 483 documents

1352
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,160
in total that have been released

1353
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,560
zero reference to fishing

1354
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,560
so what we see over there if i had to

1355
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,079
abstract all of these documents it could

1356
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,800
be

1357
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,480
the targeted collection which is where

1358
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,079
they have teams like the vpn

1359
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,160
exploitation team or the taylor tax

1360
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,359
operations that are going after a

1361
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,520
specific target developing something

1362
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,000
specifically for that as uh

1363
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,800
using the quote from andrew bustamante

1364
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,079
and then you have the bulk collection

1365
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,640
that it is okay how do you wired up like

1366
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,960
entire internal lines and people always

1367
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,960
talk about prism but prism is not that

1368
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,960
great because prism they have the legal

1369
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,160
agreement with those companies to get

1370
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,599
the data

1371
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,119
not that exciting but upstream is more

1372
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,400
exciting because they were tapping on

1373
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,520
the fiber

1374
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,119
far more interesting and basically all

1375
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,640
of that goes to some different database

1376
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,640
that they have big data solutions and

1377
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,319
then they have lots of analyst tools

1378
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,240
that they use on top of it with the most

1379
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,960
popular being xg score that nsa did such

1380
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,000
an awesome job that they even offer it

1381
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,359
to partners

1382
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:42,960
i'm not sure if swedish intelligence use

1383
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,480
it i know other neighboring countries

1384
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,520
are using it

1385
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,440
and uh lots of european countries are

1386
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,200
using xg score you can think of it like

1387
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,040
a you have all of these databases how

1388
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,040
can you say if i ever see something much

1389
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,760
in this pattern please alert an analyst

1390
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,760
or please do this action more or less

1391
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,760
like a yeah an analyst quitting tool at

1392
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,839
least it used to be like that until the

1393
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,880
last week we had that was 2018 i think

1394
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,280
on a manual development manual for xg

1395
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,400
score

1396
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,359
or xgs xjs

1397
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,760
here is another interesting

1398
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,839
part of the this leak i will just call

1399
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,000
this part this from an internal nsa

1400
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
communication says

1401
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,640
this is about router hatching for this

1402
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,560
post i'm not talking about home adsl

1403
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,240
router i'm talking about video routers

1404
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,560
such as cisco's junipers huawei's used

1405
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,400
by isps for the infrastructure cutting

1406
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,720
routers has been a good business for us

1407
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,400
and our five is

1408
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,800
five eyes partners for some time now but

1409
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,400
it's becoming more apparent that other

1410
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,480
nation states are honing the stills and

1411
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,280
joining the scene

1412
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,440
that is also going back to lucas talk

1413
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,160
from

1414
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,880
yesterday on the cisco switches

1415
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,560
it looks like yeah other nation states

1416
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,480
are holding the stills event to this day

1417
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,599
in this space

1418
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,079
yet on our side we do not pay a lot of

1419
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,480
attention to that space

1420
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,560
and this is a remember i mentioned about

1421
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,480
finn isp how they were doing man in the

1422
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,480
middle the nsa had their own tools they

1423
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,079
were calling it quantum

1424
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,760
and it was a similar approach it was

1425
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,760
tapping on the network traffic and it

1426
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,000
had like automated list of who are our

1427
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,560
targets and when picking up a target it

1428
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,560
was immediately injecting some code to

1429
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,240
redirect them on what they were calling

1430
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,160
fox ac server and

1431
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,000
think of it like an exploit kit

1432
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,280
and from there they were getting access

1433
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,400
to the system

1434
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,720
we know that this was used at least

1435
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,599
until 2016 if not further because

1436
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,079
slingshot that was a jsoc operation to

1437
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,880
hack some people in somalia and africa

1438
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,359
in general it was using that to inject

1439
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,599
malicious dll updates on microtech

1440
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,440
routers so if they were seeing people

1441
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,720
trying to update the routers in that

1442
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,480
specific part of the world

1443
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,240
they were installing they were pushing

1444
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,160
malicious dlls

1445
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,799
in the updates

1446
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,200
okay so attacking appliances i already

1447
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,079
briefly covered it so hard to detect

1448
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:57,359
pretty easy to implement because those

1449
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:58,640
things don't have a lot of hardware

1450
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,280
security they are pretty basic

1451
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,800
and highly represents them because no

1452
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,280
one is checking those the downside very

1453
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,040
specialized limited system resources

1454
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,640
they have they do not have a lot of ram

1455
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,200
cpu and so on and you need some really

1456
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,480
good reverse engineers to figure these

1457
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,839
things out because there is not a lot of

1458
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,520
documentation

1459
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,040
recent cases

1460
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,440
2018 the case i mentioned about the

1461
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,720
microtic

1462
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,680
2021 iranian servers were wiped with an

1463
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,480
ilo ios like the bmc to manage the

1464
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,040
server firmware implant

1465
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,480
interesting case we still don't know how

1466
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,839
this got in there

1467
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,440
they just bought some new servers and

1468
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,880
they came with this

1469
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,560
wiper pre-installed

1470
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,839
maybe a supply chain who knows

1471
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,000
other recent cases it is also raised

1472
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,520
yesterday from truesec they did a pretty

1473
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,040
nice presentation it's the wipers that

1474
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,920
the russian gru used to target ukraine

1475
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,240
most of them were installed by insiders

1476
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,160
and some default credentials but still

1477
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,359
there are a few that we don't know how

1478
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,359
they got in

1479
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,680
interesting case as well

1480
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,160
this year this this is a cyber security

1481
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,760
infrastructure security agency released

1482
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,240
three zero days on firewalls and a voice

1483
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,319
device that they are used by nation

1484
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:11,200
state actors and the conspiracy found

1485
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,079
two uefi based routes that the chinese

1486
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,680
actors are using

1487
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,040
so as you can see lots of things are

1488
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,720
happening in there but

1489
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,079
we are not always seeing a lot of

1490
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,319
activities think like in the whole year

1491
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,240
i'm certain that there was way more

1492
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,359
things than those happen

1493
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,800
supply chain we are in this space so now

1494
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,720
pretty hard to detect because we depend

1495
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,400
on lots of suppliers

1496
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,560
again highly persistent and it provides

1497
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,160
extensive access because typically a

1498
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,160
supplier has multiple customers so even

1499
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,240
if initially your target is one customer

1500
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,000
by getting access to this single

1501
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,480
supplier well now as a bonus you get all

1502
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,200
of the other customers

1503
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,800
the downside is that it's highly

1504
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,480
targeted like how it works you can

1505
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,079
identify which supplier is used by all

1506
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,160
of your targets and then go after this

1507
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,839
specific supplier so

1508
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,440
if that supplier has higher security

1509
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,720
standards it will make it a little bit

1510
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,440
harder to get into so more high cost

1511
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,960
more complex but high reward as well

1512
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,200
of course i have to mention the svr

1513
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,880
changes the solar winds that they

1514
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,000
compromised

1515
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,760
tons of companies those are the ones

1516
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,400
that were listed in reuters but i'm

1517
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,280
certain there are way more than those

1518
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,800
interesting part of the solar which is

1519
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,319
that i'm pretty sure people are familiar

1520
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,160
because it's very recent

1521
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,599
all of the reports that we have today

1522
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,359
even the government reports nothing

1523
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,280
mentions how the initial happen the

1524
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,800
initial access happened to solarwinds

1525
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,160
it would be good if anyone knows please

1526
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,800
let me know i couldn't find it anywhere

1527
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,440
and then on the ukraine side

1528
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,280
when the invasion started the russian

1529
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,119
invasion started

1530
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,599
we had like 70 or 80 ukrainian

1531
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,839
government websites getting defaced and

1532
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:50,559
putting like pro russia messages

1533
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:51,680
how this happened is that they had

1534
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,160
compromised a company that was offering

1535
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,160
october cms and another active

1536
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,240
development company called kidsoft that

1537
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,440
they were maintaining all of those

1538
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,880
websites so they didn't target one

1539
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,400
website at the time they just

1540
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,720
hacked the supplier of all of them

1541
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,480
and of course this is not that new but

1542
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,200
that cnn chinese pla operation aurora it

1543
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,480
is such an amazing thing if you want to

1544
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,400
research that area and basically what

1545
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,720
they had done is that they compromised

1546
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,359
rsa that at that point is producing some

1547
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,599
key photos for key fobs for two-factor

1548
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,680
authentication called secure id

1549
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,119
and the only thing they install is the

1550
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,680
seed so they can get

1551
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,119
all of the customers

1552
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,200
to a token then they use that to hack

1553
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,040
into lockheed martin

1554
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,400
like a lot of commerce there is a big

1555
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,160
list and they stole lots of information

1556
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:38,160
pretty interesting chase of supply chain

1557
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,240
also cia has a venture capital company

1558
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,599
i'm not sure if you know them it's

1559
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,000
called inquitel it's officially cia it's

1560
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,440
not like i'm matching this up you can

1561
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,119
look it up they say that

1562
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,040
and they maintain a list which is the

1563
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,880
software supply chain compromises that

1564
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,640
they document

1565
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,400
this is the trend line but i'm not sure

1566
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,839
i saw lots of things missing from there

1567
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,839
so i'm not sure how they define supply

1568
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,040
chain attacks

1569
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,359
but yeah this is uh according to cia's

1570
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:05,359
in qtel what they see supply chain

1571
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:06,079
now

1572
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,240
an interesting consideration

1573
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,920
we all know all of the news that okay

1574
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,160
china could use huawei anticlock to spy

1575
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,839
on us because they have access to this

1576
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,680
equipment

1577
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,200
what happens if

1578
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,640
let's say for instance the crypto eg

1579
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,839
example that i mentioned that's called

1580
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:21,520
operational rubicon for 50 years they

1581
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,160
were spying on people do you know how

1582
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,760
only three people in cryptog actually

1583
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,359
knew about this

1584
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,440
how because the people from bmd the

1585
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,200
german were not going as hey where b and

1586
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,559
d they were going as employees of

1587
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:33,920
siemens

1588
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,520
and the employees of the nsa were they

1589
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,079
were not going hey where the nsa let us

1590
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:39,680
build this crypto device no they were

1591
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,480
going in as contractors from motorola

1592
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,000
does this mean that anytime we use

1593
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,359
motorola we should ask him the us

1594
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,280
government has access to it

1595
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,480
i don't know just some food for thought

1596
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,200
also remember in 2013 snowden leaked

1597
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,960
some very also by the way it's not the

1598
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,400
only companies that i'm mentioning

1599
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,200
anecdotal uh evidence like in the uk

1600
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,599
raccal was the same with gchq so there

1601
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,280
are many such companies

1602
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,720
yeah i don't want to blame specific

1603
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,559
companies for that

1604
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,839
snow then leaked in 2013 a photo of uh

1605
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,160
nsa employees in the customs in the u.s

1606
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,000
opening tamper-proof packages of cisco

1607
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,200
routers

1608
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,040
flashing the framework and repackaging

1609
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,240
them that they were going to specific

1610
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,520
customers

1611
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,440
maybe this is how the ilo implant got to

1612
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,400
iran who knows

1613
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,640
another thing in

1614
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,880
in this space is a very interesting case

1615
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,960
in iran that

1616
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,400
it's called the tenor space if you want

1617
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,559
to check it up so those were some

1618
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,880
engineers that the cia recruited

1619
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,760
to sell certain parts to iran because

1620
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,960
iran couldn't buy those because they

1621
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,920
have all of the embargoes in 2008-2010

1622
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,440
and of course those parts were faulty

1623
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,040
and they caused like their nuclear

1624
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,880
systems to fail and break and they had

1625
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,480
all sorts of issues and then the swiss

1626
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,839
government figured out and they tried to

1627
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,280
proceed to those people so it's an

1628
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,480
interesting case

1629
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,839
but what i want to highlight this one is

1630
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:58,480
that supply chain is the bread and

1631
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,480
butter of spy agencies they have been

1632
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,000
doing that for

1633
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,520
several decades

1634
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,200
it is not yeah of course now we sit in

1635
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,720
the cyber space but it's not something

1636
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,599
new

1637
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,040
they have been building fake companies

1638
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,359
they have been buying companies to to

1639
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,119
target their customers so

1640
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,760
it is not anything new

1641
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,960
both for hardware and software

1642
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,880
so why do we keep on seeing fishing and

1643
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,720
not all of these things

1644
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,160
because first of all this is what we're

1645
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,040
looking for we have such good telemetry

1646
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,440
detection tools everything for fishing

1647
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,359
that it is almost impossible to miss

1648
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,720
like a

1649
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,119
i would be impressed if people can evade

1650
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,280
like modern email security solutions out

1651
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,520
there it's pretty amazing what what they

1652
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,880
can do

1653
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,160
the other is that of course nation

1654
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,240
states do use fishing

1655
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,920
of course we have attribution we can see

1656
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,680
that but the question is when do they do

1657
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:48,559
that

1658
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:50,800
for instance they might say okay

1659
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,240
let's have this operation running all

1660
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,599
the time it's a low risk even if it's

1661
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,440
discovered it's us it doesn't matter or

1662
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,520
for example in russia they are in war so

1663
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,800
of course they are going to lower the

1664
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,880
standards in terms of risks like yeah

1665
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,079
they know it's us it doesn't matter

1666
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,200
let's go after with everything we have

1667
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,000
so

1668
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,599
and also agency doesn't mean that they

1669
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,680
have like all of the super hackers out

1670
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,800
there they might have a team that they

1671
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,400
are super capable and they might have

1672
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,400
another department that they are not

1673
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,160
capable and because of bureaucratic

1674
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,680
reasons they might not be collaborating

1675
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,839
so it might be that one unit is using

1676
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:22,960
something that is not so sophisticated

1677
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,880
but the question we should be asking is

1678
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,800
when why do they use fishing and that's

1679
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,559
not something from all of the previous

1680
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,440
examples that i showed

1681
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:32,960
the other is uh

1682
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,040
because this is what we can see and what

1683
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,839
i mean by this one imagine the case of

1684
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:41,920
uh let's say government a wants to hack

1685
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,119
this specific

1686
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,760
company in a some country i don't know

1687
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:46,559
like

1688
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,559
in some place in the world and they only

1689
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,800
target 10 specific routers in that

1690
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,319
company

1691
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,160
unless we have sensors in all of the

1692
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,400
internet in that country in that isp we

1693
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,160
will never see that

1694
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,920
even if it's super noisy even if it's

1695
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,119
not ideal

1696
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,440
we do not have the telemetry to see that

1697
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,960
and then most of the cases of these

1698
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,880
operations that we are talking about

1699
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,480
they are either passive which means they

1700
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,559
are catching things on the wire and they

1701
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,559
are not modifying anything or they are

1702
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,240
very targeted

1703
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,000
so it's not only it's not happening it's

1704
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,359
we cannot see that they are happening

1705
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,040
so closing

1706
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,200
focusing on the right threads and what

1707
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,680
could you do the first is

1708
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,040
take the things that i mentioned here

1709
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,800
like network-based attacks supply chain

1710
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,800
zero days script analysis

1711
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,480
think like a nation state if you were in

1712
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,160
that position you had all of your those

1713
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,400
tools in your in your toolbox in your

1714
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,640
your arsenal and you wanted to target

1715
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,800
your organization

1716
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,559
what could you use how would you do it

1717
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,880
to be as deniable as possible so even if

1718
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,240
you just discovered you cannot say who

1719
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,480
did it

1720
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,880
the other part is that do not trust

1721
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,720
third parties that they say provide

1722
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,200
secure solutions find a way to verify

1723
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,119
them whether this is

1724
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,400
having your own people whether this is

1725
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,000
hiring a company whether it is going

1726
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,359
through some very

1727
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:04,319
exhaustive compliance uh verification

1728
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,640
not just a checkbook clicks not just a

1729
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,000
checkbox

1730
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,079
find a way to do that don't assume they

1731
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,040
are secure because they have a stamp

1732
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,640
the other is that the

1733
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,119
i think by now it should be pretty clear

1734
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,160
signals intelligence is one option but

1735
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,880
it's not everything and in many cases

1736
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,960
having an insider might be easier

1737
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,640
quicker and cheaper

1738
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,319
for instance this week

1739
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,240
marge did the hearing in the us congress

1740
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,520
and he mentioned that

1741
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,480
india had agents in twitter china had

1742
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,160
the interest in twitter and we know from

1743
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,160
the department of justice in 2020 that

1744
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,119
they they managed to dismantle a whole

1745
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:43,280
network of saudi intelligence agents

1746
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,160
into iteration so maybe it's easier for

1747
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,240
instead of trying to hack twitter just

1748
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,599
hire someone inside and call them and

1749
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,359
tell them hey tell me who is doing that

1750
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,760
or that

1751
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,559
all

1752
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,079
they are all the other cases i mentioned

1753
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:57,040
that uh

1754
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,960
yeah having an insider might be easy

1755
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,400
just to install something so that we can

1756
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,480
bypass all of the controls

1757
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,119
or you could use both

1758
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,280
and for people that want to do research

1759
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,839
first of all what nation state and i

1760
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:12,319
mean intelligence agents hate the most

1761
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:15,200
is public exposure they are designed

1762
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,119
they are everything around the culture

1763
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,440
of intelligence is operating in the

1764
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,200
shadows

1765
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,839
i have talked with lots of people former

1766
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,359
people in agencies

1767
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,520
this is what like

1768
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,359
they don't even want to consider going

1769
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:30,720
public so

1770
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,400
what should we do anytime we find

1771
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,319
something like that go public talk about

1772
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:35,040
it

1773
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,040
and also push for change if you see a

1774
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,040
vendor that they are not working in this

1775
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,480
optimal way or they are not letting your

1776
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,880
people poke in their device for whatever

1777
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,359
reasons of like tampering their device

1778
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,359
don't work with them make it public the

1779
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,040
defender is not working in a secure

1780
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,079
manner

1781
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:51,520
also there are many areas that we are

1782
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,520
not touching a lot like a network

1783
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,200
tampering integrity well i mentioned

1784
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,640
them here you can see them mobile phone

1785
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,440
certain analysis script analysis

1786
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,160
and uh blind spots on the internet lots

1787
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,079
of blind spots every time we use a

1788
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:05,760
thread feed from a vendor

1789
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,520
remember that this vendor gets this from

1790
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,599
ins the response and sensors they have

1791
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,799
deployed in the world most likely there

1792
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:14,079
are many places in the world they have

1793
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:17,839
no sensors and no instant response

1794
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,359
and that was it thanks everyone

1795
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:22,960
you can contact me in any of those i

1796
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,240
will also be around because i don't

1797
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,359
think we have a lot of time for

1798
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,760
questions but we might have some of them

1799
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,640
uh yeah thank you very much we do have

1800
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,720
some uh

1801
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,319
questions from the audience to start

1802
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:35,200
with

1803
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,359
and first of all i would like to ask you

1804
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,440
because nation state

1805
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,520
has been a very like

1806
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,240
term that have a very broad meaning when

1807
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,319
especially when you read the news do you

1808
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,079
feel there is a misperception what's

1809
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:50,160
actually nation staged and state

1810
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,319
sponsored and do you have any comments

1811
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:54,000
about the terminology yeah there is a

1812
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,520
whole categorization actually the use

1813
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,599
government has like a state sponsored

1814
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,960
state

1815
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,240
what is it

1816
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,200
state supported um like they have a

1817
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,720
whole subcategorization but here i'm

1818
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,319
talking about the actual intelligence

1819
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:08,319
organizations that are belonging to the

1820
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:10,880
government or the military not uh let's

1821
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,400
say auxiliaries or proxies they could

1822
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,000
use

1823
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,319
during those activities

1824
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:20,000
um okay the the next question was uh all

1825
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,480
of this leak how this affected your work

1826
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,799
i mean working before snowden with this

1827
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:26,720
research and and

1828
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,720
all the leaks that happened how has that

1829
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,720
affected your research and do you think

1830
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,799
there is a wider acceptance

1831
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:33,599
the

1832
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,359
housing i think it is easier to talk

1833
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:36,799
about these things not only with snowden

1834
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:38,400
like with all of the clicks that happen

1835
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,680
all the time snow then of course it was

1836
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,520
a big bunch of licks but shadow browsers

1837
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,640
wikileaks

1838
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,799
also from time time like a vice releases

1839
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:46,400
the intercept they keep on releasing

1840
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,520
classified information so it is nice

1841
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,359
because you can let's say for instance

1842
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:52,640
you might know that these things are

1843
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,839
happening you might have an idea you

1844
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:55,280
might have indications but you get the

1845
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,200
full picture so it

1846
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,559
let's say it helps you complete the

1847
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,760
puzzle of how things are put together

1848
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,480
um another great question like like is

1849
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,000
there a government we can trust

1850
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:10,400
i have no idea i wouldn't trust any

1851
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,520
government

1852
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,880
mainly because governments are people

1853
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,240
i'm certain all of governments the

1854
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,680
majority of the people have very good

1855
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,040
intentions and they want to do the right

1856
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,920
thing but there will always be

1857
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,680
things that like people that will try to

1858
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,079
abuse that and also

1859
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:26,000
again from my limited experience or

1860
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,599
research all of the governments put

1861
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:29,520
government first and people second and

1862
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,119
all the military puts military first and

1863
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:32,720
people second which means if they have

1864
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,240
to choose between

1865
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,760
okay should we do all these things that

1866
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,520
might not be that great for all to all

1867
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,799
of the people or

1868
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:40,240
should we not do it because it's going

1869
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,599
to violate their human rights well

1870
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:44,160
they're going to do it most likely

1871
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,040
um okay and and a question about your

1872
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,760
closing comments which was like to to

1873
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,000
open source and always bring out in the

1874
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,079
out in the light but should we be

1875
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:56,880
worried that that open source reachers

1876
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,720
this is presented at this conference are

1877
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,599
weaponized and actually put into these

1878
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:04,240
programs and absolutely i am certain a

1879
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,760
good example is lucas talked from

1880
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,079
yesterday that was released as a zero

1881
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:10,400
nights talk initially and then lukas

1882
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,760
figured out that some government was

1883
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,839
already abusing it to hack hotels in

1884
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:15,599
sweden so

1885
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,440
yeah of course the same way that we

1886
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,440
learn from all of the companies

1887
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,319
yeah nation states are also learning

1888
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,400
okay uh thank you very much for

1889
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,480
enlightening presentation uh and um yeah

1890
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,079
we're gonna have a short 50 minutes

1891
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,960
break

1892
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,240
and be back here a quarter past

1893
