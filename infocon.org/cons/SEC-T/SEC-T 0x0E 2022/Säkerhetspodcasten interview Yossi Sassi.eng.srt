1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,880
all right hello everyone we're uh here

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,599
at SEC T it's uh Friday and uh the

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,040
second day and the second day everyone

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,759
is very uh tired tired yeah but we

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,680
enjoyed an awesome talk by you you see

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,980
and uh as always a lot of energy yeah

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,900
thank you and it was like drinking from

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,960
a fire hose so I'm I'm gonna have to

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,359
look at on your GitHub page because

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,240
there was so much I wanted it was like I

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,739
everything is public exactly enjoy the

12
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,360
ride that's a really good one yeah yeah

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,100
it's like that's how I started

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,079
deliberately by saying you know there's

15
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,940
going to be a lot of stuff so just relax

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,280
understand what you see enjoy the ride

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,140
but because all the code and the slides

18
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,840
is already on GitHub so yeah no don't

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,000
don't try to write anything or just uh

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,820
listen and enjoy it yeah yeah but but I

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,520
mean the the take I'd say from this

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,219
um is really as a as a blue team or is

23
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,739
like what

24
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,420
how should we go about you know

25
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,100
protecting against this well it's you

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,479
know I have a big heart for Bluetooth

27
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,000
blue teamers and I think like a retina

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,580
but my heart is with the blue team and

29
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,740
uh to be honest I think really to be a

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,780
good blue team it's much more difficult

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,000
than a pen tester or retina to be honest

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,759
uh it's it's a really tough job and it

33
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,640
gets tougher with the years and we need

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,439
good people there and in general

35
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,240
especially when you think about defenses

36
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,299
uh they are not binary right you just

37
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:37,860
the only thing you can measure is time

38
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,840
time to detect time to protect time to

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,479
respond Etc and to narrow it down all

40
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,159
the time and this requires good people

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,240
good procedures baselines hardening even

42
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,060
before products because as you can see

43
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,159
all the time with breaches and as you

44
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,659
could see also in this presentation it's

45
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,360
very easy to bypass a lot of security

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,220
products as an industry and

47
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,079
it's very challenging for the blue

48
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,759
teamers in terms of Powershell what you

49
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,920
saw here like you saw there are defenses

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,979
but there are easily bypassed I would

51
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,540
say you don't have to try to block

52
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,220
Powershell it's not the right attitude

53
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,620
you have to be to able to manage it so

54
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,260
try to just find anomalies in the actual

55
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,120
code running on the machines because the

56
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,800
block it will not work as you saw yeah

57
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,020
you can run it in so many different ways

58
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,140
millions of variants yeah so

59
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,840
you showed me lots of crazy stuff with a

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,760
little bit

61
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,500
seeming gopher mode but this was more

62
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,360
remember this was more General like yes

63
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,099
or powershello not focused on a specific

64
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,800
attack area right so

65
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,879
um what your your title was about

66
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,920
converting people from back yeah yeah

67
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,540
and you sure converted me yeah

68
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,340
I wouldn't lose uh you know I wouldn't

69
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,220
stop using uh bash or shell scripts or

70
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,519
whatever the idea was maybe to tease a

71
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,860
bit just for people to listen because if

72
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,500
you say it's a cool session on partial

73
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,599
maybe people will not be interested but

74
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,700
yeah yeah

75
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:19,260
it will make you think yeah yeah and to

76
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,459
be honest I think and I got some

77
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,040
feedback when I came down you know it

78
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,140
kind of worked because I wanted people

79
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,819
to learn to appreciate Powershell

80
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,519
differently both as a retina or blue

81
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,840
timel and I think it it worked hopefully

82
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,280
to see the power playing around with

83
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,120
power Linux Linux yes I did quite a lot

84
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,040
and how is that though is it you have to

85
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,959
load a lot of modules how does it even

86
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,060
work no you just install it on it's on

87
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,599
GitHub you just clone it uh run it yeah

88
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,959
it works pretty straightforward

89
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,659
yeah I had no I know yeah I've never

90
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:58,579
started it I just saw it

91
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,040
Linux I would use it uh for uh a bunch

92
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,900
of things that require me to do like

93
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,080
extensive piping like pipe pipe to pipe

94
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,360
that I need to keep the object yeah

95
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,459
instead of parsing text which is cool

96
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,100
you can also always do it on Linux but

97
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,260
with Powershell you actually get objects

98
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,100
so you can convert except you can just

99
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,139
take the exact information you want very

100
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,220
easily in uh sure in less code yeah that

101
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,440
makes sense the power of objects so it's

102
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,780
like python so it has objects it's cool

103
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,780
but it's very intuitive like bash so

104
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,300
LSPs curl you don't have to write a lot

105
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,639
of code you know to access to be

106
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,440
proficient yeah yeah that's pretty cool

107
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,699
yeah

108
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,160
because I I think many people like me

109
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,020
feel that when you

110
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,780
when you when you first meet Powershell

111
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,220
that

112
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,340
it's strange and weird and and it's not

113
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,759
like the things you know before

114
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,940
uh so so there's a little bit uh for you

115
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,759
uh who we can assume with a power user

116
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,479
at Powershell now uh does it start to

117
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,280
come natural because because I think

118
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,280
it's very much an inversion inversion of

119
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,100
how you think about scripting when you

120
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,020
you know the

121
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,780
the beginning is uh is a bit hard for

122
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,160
some people also for me it wasn't

123
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,979
totally intuitive because the syntax in

124
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:27,660
the beginning takes time it takes time

125
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,600
to get used to how Microsoft built the

126
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,180
sit next because it's like a mix of uh

127
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,580
Pearl and Java I don't know like you

128
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,960
have the curly brackets and you have

129
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,360
dollar underscore like yeah Pearl for

130
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,600
each loops and it's like a mix colon

131
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,539
colon yeah it's like a bit of every

132
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,900
language but I think I uh at some early

133
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,240
point I I looked at it as an advantage

134
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,400
so although partial is the new kid in

135
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,280
the block of scripting it's fairly new

136
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,639
but it had the time to learn from other

137
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,919
languages so it took like the best

138
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,800
Concepts from every language yeah and

139
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,440
tried

140
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,320
success

141
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,800
but it tried to make like a super sort

142
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,560
of shell I would say it's good to know

143
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,600
it yeah I it doesn't have to replace

144
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,520
anything you know on the contrary it's

145
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,280
just another very strong scripting

146
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,020
language especially on Windows but not

147
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,600
only on Linux also I did really cool

148
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,100
stuff with it

149
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,500
cool so if you want to know more about

150
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,240
you where can you where can they find

151
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,819
more about me yeah

152
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:37,979
all my awesome profile on the Internet

153
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,500
is about music so that's true that's

154
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,300
actually really cool when you look uh

155
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,100
for my name on data you just find videos

156
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,520
of me playing uh in rock festivals and

157
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,039
playing weird guitars that I built uh

158
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,080
buzukita it's an instrument I invented

159
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,780
it's like a Greek mandolin with the

160
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,360
electric guitar and a acoustic guitar in

161
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,240
one body in high quality so that's all

162
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,280
you see in Google but if you look quite

163
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,139
closely then you find the GitHub and you

164
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:05,819
find okay it does something with

165
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:09,000
security also but but the Rockstar team

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,220
