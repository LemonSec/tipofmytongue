1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,600
wow there's a lot of people um

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,360
last time we weren't that many now it's

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,960
like super crowded it's exciting it's

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,639
good to see you guys

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:13,599
um

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,160
i hope you stayed healthy

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,520
my talk today is

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,840
censored

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,080
a lot but

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,760
i think it will give you some some value

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,880
and some key takeaways as well

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,000
i title is a little clickbaity but there

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,280
is actually

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,120
some truth in this

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,719
i call it the four horsemen of cyber

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,280
warfare and one of those is famine

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,559
or pestilence if you like

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,719
for those who don't know or if they do

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,520
care

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,559
my name is lucas and uh

21
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,320
i founded my own company

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,239
scary but it works

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,079
uh i've been in the id security industry

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,199
for around 22 years now um

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,879
been at defcon black hat and presented

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,719
some stuff there as well

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,239
um

28
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,040
passions for those who are taking notes

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,200
movies disappearing into the woods a

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,600
little bit with my dog and

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,119
entrepreneurship that's a new one i

32
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,479
didn't expect that

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,080
as well as sales and communication

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,119
so why are the four horsemen

35
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,280
it's a good question um

36
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,920
the main reason for something to be

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,280
called the four horsemen is that it

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,920
needs to have an impact that is

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,159
para a paradigm shift it needs to be

40
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,159
something that can be used and can be

41
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,520
destructive in so many ways

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,640
and for me

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,600
it's also something that can be

44
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,920
easy applicable so you don't have to be

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,159
a rocket scientist or

46
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,479
obliques reverse engineering assembly to

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,079
understand or actually do

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,880
famine or pestilence as i call it has

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,799
been and is currently being exploited

50
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,560
from 2016 and

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,119
forward so what is the worst case

52
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,720
scenario with this what i call

53
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,480
pestilence or famine

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,640
well the worst case scenario here is

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,239
that you can

56
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,000
break into

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,200
any

58
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,680
of these devices that are vulnerable

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,239
which basically switches

60
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,040
now these switches can be

61
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,800
if you're targeting a corporation or a

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,840
company they can be on the line to that

63
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,120
corporation that means they can be on

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,200
the road on the path so everything in

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,640
its path

66
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,800
you can control that means redirecting

67
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,080
traffic

68
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,560
you can upload and download cisco

69
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,239
configuration files

70
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,440
as well as flash the firmware

71
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,280
and flashing the firmware is also but

72
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,319
it's out of this topic something that

73
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,800
can be done that means backdooring a

74
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,160
cisco firmware

75
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,080
that then flash onto the device and then

76
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,200
the device itself is is backward

77
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,239
so

78
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,560
worst case scenario i can take down the

79
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,840
internet

80
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,280
and you can take down the internet with

81
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,440
a one-liner code five minutes writing 10

82
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,239
minutes execution

83
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,720
how many in here have heard of cisco

84
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,840
smart install before

85
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,120
a couple of hands are up yeah

86
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,640
that's um

87
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
i thought it was going to be more

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
actually

89
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,640
how many of you have heard of the smart

90
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,680
install

91
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,120
vulnerabilities that have been popping

92
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,879
up

93
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,840
couple

94
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,400
it's great

95
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,879
this was

96
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,000
actually

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,680
my talk is based on someone else's

98
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,879
research

99
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,360
yeah a blatant copy i know

100
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,319
but i took it a little bit further um

101
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,000
so i like to give trick credit where

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,640
credit is due to dimitri kuznetsov who

103
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,599
actually

104
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,239
did the whole analysis and find a way to

105
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,720
abuse the cisco smart install protocol

106
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,959
that we're going to see here today

107
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,879
so i'm covering this because it's mostly

108
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,400
unheard of i saw very few hands up

109
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,000
which is a bit worrisome

110
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,519
and i even know that our own cert.sc way

111
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,358
back has flagged this as

112
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,000
problematic

113
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,720
so smart install basically works as

114
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,400
let's say you have a big corporation and

115
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,080
you take the switch and you need to

116
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,360
deploy it that means that the

117
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,880
configuration needs to be uploaded

118
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,639
configured and set

119
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,120
smart install is based in such a way

120
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,320
that you can take a switch and just

121
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,240
attach it to your network and it will

122
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240
propagate the the configuration needed

123
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,000
to function which is a huge time saver

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,440
same thing with firmware updates and

125
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,560
flashes

126
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,440
can be automated

127
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,560
but

128
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,919
to explain it easy it's basically

129
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,680
pushing or pulling configuration to a

130
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,960
tftp server

131
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,600
and if you want there's a link in the

132
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,639
description as well to the full

133
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,320
documentation explaining how how it

134
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,120
works and how it works in csgo

135
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,840
for those who know me know that i

136
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,360
i like when stuff is unauthenticated

137
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,520
and yeah you kind of guessed it since

138
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,120
it's a talk for me this is

139
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,880
unauthenticated

140
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,800
which means that anyone can actually

141
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,039
interact with smart install and

142
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,240
send commands back and forth

143
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,320
and that means that you could probably

144
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,320
download configuration files upload

145
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,199
configuration files

146
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,800
but it's not supposed to be exposed i

147
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,520
mean it's supposed to be ip

148
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,000
blacklisted or whitelisted and inside a

149
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,400
network management network somewhere

150
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,479
internally

151
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,680
emphasis on the should be right

152
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,600
so um

153
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,039
i will start this off with a little

154
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,400
story

155
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,680
and please bear in mind the story has

156
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,199
been very censored

157
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,440
the story is way cooler than i say it

158
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,479
here

159
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,600
but

160
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,319
late autumn 2016 i got a

161
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,639
python script from a friend of a friend

162
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,639
for optimization issues he needed to get

163
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,840
it to work

164
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,280
and um

165
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,560
yeah i helped him with it i didn't pay

166
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,080
much attention to it and helped him a

167
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,160
little bit with it and something with

168
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,720
configuration files for switches

169
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,560
god if i know

170
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,479
a couple of months later i was actually

171
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,479
at a client

172
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,560
who is in the power industry so it was a

173
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,840
power plant

174
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,280
type thing

175
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,840
and i found this weird port open that

176
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,759
nmap couldn't identify

177
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,840
i was like okay this is this is

178
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,280
interesting

179
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,120
and i remember this script wasn't that

180
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,919
this port 4786 or something like that

181
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,560
and yes it was what that allowed me to

182
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,360
do

183
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,720
on that network is download the

184
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,800
configuration files from their main

185
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,000
switch

186
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,639
i could then see all the vlans i could

187
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,479
rewrite the configuration file and

188
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,080
upload it and then

189
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,360
have the switch

190
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,080
you know do a quick reboot and then

191
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,759
i was up and running on their industrial

192
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,160
control system

193
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,840
no authentication just a simple script

194
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,000
then it kind of got to me like okay they

195
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,360
have it

196
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,000
and as i always do i think

197
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,440
is anybody exposing this

198
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,599
turns out that

199
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,440
yeah they did

200
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,599
a lot

201
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,440
now we'll get to the exact numbers

202
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,120
um a little bit later so i'm not going

203
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,880
to spoil it

204
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,880
but see it as the tool is called was

205
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,800
made by dimitri kuznetsov

206
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,680
and it's basically a tftp server and a

207
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,120
python script that

208
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
tells the cisco switch to

209
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,960
download the configuration

210
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,880
and send it to attacker control tftp

211
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,599
now caveat you need to be just connected

212
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,280
without a firewall if you don't want to

213
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,720
mess with port forwarding and stuff like

214
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,440
that

215
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,360
but if you have like just a linux box

216
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,039
online you can do this

217
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,280
and

218
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,919
it allows some some easy exploitation

219
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,479
what is also funny is that on darknet

220
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,479
deep web whatever you call it

221
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,120
there were heaps of these configuration

222
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,639
files downloaded

223
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,759
around two to five gigabytes um

224
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,479
belong to everything from

225
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,639
os vendors to weapons manufacturers to

226
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,520
banks

227
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,400
governments military

228
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,160
and this is how easy it is i

229
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,320
made a thing for you here so you can see

230
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,279
that this is not rocket science i just

231
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,399
click my pointer and

232
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,000
and i have the tft pile tftp file

233
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,320
all i had to do now is edit it in my

234
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,720
vi and that's it

235
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,800
i have the configuration file of that

236
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,040
device that was vulnerable

237
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,640
in a couple of seconds now you can

238
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,200
actually combine this and do like a

239
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,519
you know one liner foo where you take an

240
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,160
n map or c map or mass scan and you just

241
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,160
pass that along to this one see a tool

242
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,399
to download a configuration file

243
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,920
making it nice and tight putting in a

244
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,760
comfort you know in a folder structure

245
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,720
or

246
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,560
doing some other analysis on it which

247
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,560
i've done before which is basically

248
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,519
checking the version of the

249
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,320
configuration file checking for

250
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,080
misconfigurations and errors

251
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,760
as well

252
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
but now you you have the config file you

253
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,600
can modify it and you can also upload it

254
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,399
through tftp or in this case it

255
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,279
um

256
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,480
and the switch will grab it from your

257
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,720
tftp and say good job

258
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,320
you can also modify a firmware if you're

259
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,760
hardcore enough

260
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,000
up upload that one and have that

261
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,800
you know flash

262
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,360
and uh once that is done you you have

263
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,720
access

264
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,080
there are some cool data in there as

265
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,440
well like triple a servers

266
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,640
you know pax

267
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,160
stuff when i did my medical in the

268
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,640
livestock there's also some

269
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,959
you know radius servers and connections

270
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,240
that you can analyze vpns

271
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,040
so

272
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,000
a lot of

273
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,839
fun stuff in config files

274
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,120
the main reason why so few have heard

275
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,240
about this

276
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,680
i think

277
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,000
is that cisco

278
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,040
they did an announcement in 2017 at the

279
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,680
same time as our cert dot se

280
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,120
and that

281
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,079
this is

282
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,519
it's not their problem

283
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,200
this is informational

284
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,360
you can abuse the tftp

285
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,120
and it was dead silent

286
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,640
when i did the scan just to find

287
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,519
vulnerabilities on this i didn't get one

288
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,760
single complaint

289
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,440
usually when i scan the internet i get

290
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,480
like

291
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,279
everything from abuse to blacklist to to

292
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,880
all the things in my mailbox saying that

293
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,480
ah you shouldn't sport scan us you

294
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,880
shouldn't do this in this case dead

295
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,279
silent not one complaint which means

296
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,200
that it's not being picked up by back

297
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,720
then ids idps firewalls

298
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,519
there were no rules

299
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,560
and that's that's a little bit scary um

300
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,079
so this is probably the main reason you

301
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,360
haven't heard about it cisco wants you

302
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,640
to keep information because it's not

303
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,800
their problem i can understand csgo's

304
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,240
point of view here

305
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,120
i mean

306
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,480
you're not supposed to host it

307
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,440
externally but as we all know if if

308
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,640
you're not supposed to do something

309
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,800
someone is probably doing it

310
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,079
and um

311
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,760
yeah that is super bad

312
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,279
cisco

313
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,720
i know friends of mine haven't talked to

314
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,160
cisco and tried to change it from an

315
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,839
informational to an higher medium just

316
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,320
to get some more traction on this and

317
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,519
yes this has been going on since 2016

318
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,440
and it's the same

319
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,959
which is which

320
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,640
basically command execution on the

321
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,199
switch and

322
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,800
but they have other vulnerabilities for

323
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
the t for the smart install protocol

324
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,519
that you can also use in order to

325
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,279
you know remote code execute which was

326
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,040
patched really quickly

327
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,720
but this is basically a remote code

328
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,800
execution as well per se

329
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,200
but there's no no authentication

330
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,320
around it or to it so

331
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,560
oops

332
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,399
getting ahead of myself

333
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,320
so the time span that this was active

334
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,959
and what i was doing was

335
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,200
mr kushner is doing his research and my

336
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,519
friend comes to me with the script

337
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,440
um

338
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,040
and he actually scans the internet he

339
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,399
doesn't give out any details he just

340
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,639
says he scanned his internet and it's

341
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,399
scary that's what he says in his

342
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,839
presentation there's a link to the

343
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,160
seronites presentation as well

344
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,160
in the powerpoint so if you want that

345
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,480
just let me know it should be in here

346
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,720
which also um

347
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,399
describes the technical details the

348
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,560
communication in between the script and

349
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,720
the tftp and how all that is tied

350
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,360
together with smart install

351
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,920
um active exploitation

352
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,200
throughout 2017 without much fuss

353
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,519
and from what i've seen we have like i

354
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,320
said military weapons manufacturers

355
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,519
governments

356
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,279
banks

357
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,519
isps backbones hospitals

358
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,720
you name it

359
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,959
it was there

360
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,920
now patching it would not just be

361
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,839
problematic since you can do the flash

362
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,240
the firmware reflash right so

363
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,160
here you have to probably nuke the

364
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,639
switch replace it or re-flash it

365
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,639
yourself

366
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,240
cisco released their first advisor in

367
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,760
2017 and uh at the same time there and

368
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,240
search dot see released their

369
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,720
information as well warning people that

370
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,519
you shouldn't expose this this is bad

371
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,959
and it's still up there on cert if you

372
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,880
look you will find your smart install on

373
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,079
certain sc and you will find it

374
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,040
2022 and it's

375
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,120
it's still being exploited actively

376
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,560
if we look at the numbers

377
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,240
when i got in contact with john natalie

378
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,399
who has showed and i told him please you

379
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,120
know

380
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,120
this port listen to it see what you can

381
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,800
do see what you can find

382
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,040
back then it was almost you know

383
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,560
been a while

384
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,680
so we were looking at possibly 600 000

385
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,480
vulnerable switches down to 320 000

386
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,320
which you see here

387
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,760
further down 2017 to 204 000 i think it

388
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,440
says

389
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,399
and 2018 181 something happened there

390
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,519
between 2018 and 2019 i think more

391
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,680
people became aware that this was a

392
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,639
problem

393
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,440
so they started closing it down

394
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,959
uh everything has been going smoothly

395
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,040
it's a steady decline rate which is

396
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,360
fantastic

397
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,440
until last month

398
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,800
there was actually an increase i think

399
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,240
it was 1.4 increase so 50-ish new

400
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,680
machines

401
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,839
or new switches were visible

402
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,680
on showdown

403
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,199
i don't like that and that's why i'm

404
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,359
here

405
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,600
what i've been doing for the last

406
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,639
like three months more actively is

407
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,639
contacting companies

408
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,680
and

409
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
i've been reaching out to linkedin

410
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,959
um

411
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,519
once i had too much going and rolling

412
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,320
with

413
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,240
around 100 companies worldwide i thought

414
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,160
no it's too much i need to focus and

415
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,680
i'll focus in-house i've been focusing

416
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
here at sweden so if if you got a call

417
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,639
from me

418
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,199
first of all i'm sorry um

419

second of all i don't mean you no harm

420
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,079
i'm just here to highlight something

421
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,120
that is

422
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,959
in these times critical for our

423
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,720
infrastructure

424
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,360
that can be used to take down

425
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,839
us sweden that can be used to take down

426
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,920
countries of the world

427
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,760
it can be used to take down russia and

428
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,160
ukraine

429
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,600

448
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,839

which you have on these ip addresses

480
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,439
which can lead to this

481
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,679

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,480
um

490
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
that has been my my main goal the main

491
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,240
goal of my company is to make the world

492
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,000
just a little bit more secure today than

493
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,520
it was yesterday

494
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,000
cringe i know but but

495
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,240
i mean i have to call someone right so

496
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,400
and that's what i've been doing like

497
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,799
have so many i had to keep tabs on which

498
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,480
companies are contacted white ip

499
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,080
addresses who i reached out to what time

500
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,600
i reached out to them and then set

501
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,360
reminders for everything and just

502
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,200
spending days reaching out

503
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,880
and doing this pro bono as well because

504
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
i don't know if they want anything sure

505
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,120
fine i'm here but i just want to make it

506
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,239
just a little bit more safe

507
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,240
all images are ar generated did i say

508
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,080
that so it's pretty cool

509
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,559
statistics for sweden and that's uh

510
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,760
because my home turf

511
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,120
when it started in 2017 we got

512
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,760
3288

513
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,679
not that much if you think it's just 3

514
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,760
000 devices but what those are connected

515
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,520
to

516
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,919
is the highest impact

517
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,600
so if they belong to our core networks

518
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,400
or

519
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,000
you know everything that makes our

520
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,160
government run then it's it's a problem

521
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,360
today as of two days ago we have 46 i

522
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,879
hope that number has increased

523
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,240
else meet me outside

524
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,240
i managed

525
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,720
i managed according to myself maybe not

526
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,840
just me

527
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,720
but

528
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,880
get it down by for instance 58.9

529
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,640
from the last three months or something

530
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,000
like that

531
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,520
maybe it's me maybe it's not i don't

532
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,720
really care but it's a number and it's

533
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,880
there

534
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,120
now the usage in cyber warfare is

535
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,240
something that i'd like to highlight as

536
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,520
well you can not only modify the

537
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,600
configuration you can get a view on how

538
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
they're handling their both internal

539
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,760
network and their security so with all

540
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,799
these

541
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,640
configuration files

542
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,840
downloaded you can run tools to analyze

543
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,440
what version what vulnerabilities and

544
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,840
what missed configurations what i saw

545
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,799
was

546
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,799
it's basically a set and forget so to

547
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,400
take the c switch install whatever you

548
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,720
want do the network set it forget it

549
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,880
that means that 90 of all the switches

550
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,799
that i saw had critical vulnerabilities

551
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,799
in them

552
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,760
31

553
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,200
or so had medium vulnerabilities

554
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,160
and

555
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,320
50 of them had low vulnerabilities or

556
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,320
misconfigurations

557
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,240
i have a government i'm not going to

558
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,559
name one

559
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,679
which

560
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,080
i found that in every hotel

561
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,280
in this country

562
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,000
there is a root certificate installed

563
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
which means that it's a signed route so

564
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,760
they can read your ssl

565
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,840
and traffic forwarded to a listening

566
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,600
interface

567
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,039
which

568
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,200
yeah redirects all traffic

569
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,280
i confronted them about this

570
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,200
and said hi

571
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,039
why are you doing this

572
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,880
and basically god maybe you shouldn't

573
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,799
battle in things you

574
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,760
you that is above you basically so i let

575
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,799
that slide

576
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,320
but very interesting things in these

577
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,799
configuration files vpn connections

578
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,320
between

579
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,240
certain parties that shouldn't have vpn

580
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,400
connections so from a political point of

581
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,400
view this is can of water as well

582
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,000
you can defeat load balancers with it

583
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,840
and i work with a couple of companies

584
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,960
that

585
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,840
protect people from ddos attacks but

586
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,360
they had this one as well and those were

587
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,720
one of the first i reached out to and

588
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,559
said yo patch it

589
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,520
because

590
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,679
their entire infrastructure with this

591
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,919
would be fubar

592
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,120
because you can just redirect traffic

593
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,559
anyway and have the denial of service

594
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,799
attack come from the inside basically

595
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,080
and in cyber warfare i mentioned

596
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,240
what's going on in the world

597
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,000
and our situation in it the tense

598
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,919
situation that we're in

599
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,280
and we really need to do something

600
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,400
i manage or i am going to show you what

601
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,840
is public out there

602
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,720
these are the networks top networks

603
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,200
according to shodhan that has cisco

604
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,720
smart install

605
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,799
exposing outwards you can see for

606
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,880
instance korea telecom i hope nobody

607
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,400
hears from korea telecom then i'm very

608
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,120
sorry i have 305

609
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,440
switches exposed and you're kind of

610
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
wondering which devices are vulnerable

611
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,960
well if they have smart install and it's

612
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,960
exposed

613
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,799
there we go that's a win

614
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,640
comcast we also have something called

615
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,919
governmental communications network

616
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,480
don't know what that is but

617
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,039
it's public

618
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,320
are we checking per country

619
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,919
u.s top dog you know it

620
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,919
we also have russia in there which is uh

621
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,559
also a little bit tense maybe in great

622
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,080
britain

623
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,039
now

624
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,480
when we see this number we're thinking

625
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,360
again it's just 1812 devices but then

626
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,440
again what are they connected to

627
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,880
what is the route they're going through

628
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,960
and what traffic passes through

629
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,919
and

630
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,039
that's what's important

631
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,280
oh too fast man

632
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,200
what can you do

633
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,440
i'm going to ask you something

634
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,679
and not just present something that is

635
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:58,720
awesome i'm going to ask you to do

636
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,880
something if you do networking and pen

637
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,760
test and you can come over port 4786 at

638
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,799
a gig

639
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,919
please talk to your clients and have

640
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,080
them close if you're working for an isp

641
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,320
then please

642
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,919
take a little bit responsibility for

643
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,919
your for your clients networks

644
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,720
and especially the u.s companies tend to

645
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,480
push to blame

646
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,400
i submitted a bug bounty for google of

647
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,240
course got denied

648
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,960
uh where they had this open on all

649
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,039
fiber connections basically

650
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,480
in a certain area in google but i said

651
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,840
no that's the customer it's not a

652
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,720
problem

653
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,200
i counter with so if that one breaks who

654
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,400
is the customer going to call well

655
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,559
that's us

656
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,919
there we go

657
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,840
so how about i bring those 200 down and

658
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,320
then we'll see how the

659
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,000
how it's going to work how many banks

660
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,440
are connected to that one unknown

661
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,520
uh you can do the check showdown part

662
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,880
with just the

663
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,960
ec one liner port 4786 country sweden

664
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,760
quotation marks smart

665
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,799
and

666
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,640
again please if your isp take

667
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,000
responsibility a little bit and just

668
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,520
notify your clients if you have this in

669
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,799
your network

670
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,600
and

671
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,880
the swedish ones have been very

672
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,720
cooperative

673
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,240
danish ones

674
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,360
somewhat

675
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
outside of that

676
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,120
not at all

677
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,400
um

678
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,760
but there are attacks going on out there

679
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,600
i got a call um months ago from someone

680
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,760
deep down in the rabbit hole

681
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,760
asking what my ip was for the research

682
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,080
machine in order to just correlate some

683
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,400
attack patterns they saw

684
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,799
so they can rule me out

685
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,039
so it's being actively exploited i found

686
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,480
a found this vulnerability and i got

687
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,000
rewarded for it for the department of

688
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,480
defense actually

689
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,080
it was a backbone to program and there

690
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,400
was a ip address and a cisco switch

691
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,320
which had this one open

692
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,600
checking the configuration it was

693
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,520
connected to a femtocell which is used

694
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,240
to monitor and listen to mobile traffic

695
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,640
that's as far as i

696
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,640
know at least

697
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,000
but that one got closed and that's

698
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,840
that's perfect

699
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,000
no reward just the credit and the patent

700
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,320
the shoulder good boy

701
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,840
thank you

702
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,600
how do you fix this

703
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,000
it's very very very hard

704
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,240
it's one line no v-stack

705
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,840
that's it get that into your

706
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,919
configuration get that into the console

707
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,080
type it you're done

708
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,159
that's cisco's fix on it and there's a

709
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,000
link to the pdf down below if you want

710
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,120
to reach read more about the

711
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,400
vulnerability and how it's actually

712
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,080
being done

713
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,919
[Music]

714
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,679
there was an unconfirmed rumor i don't

715
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,799
know if it's true

716
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,320
because some network people i've talked

717
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,039
about i never opened something like this

718
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,799
and they started speculating and busting

719
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,799
that it came with a firmware update and

720
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,799
automatically open

721
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,360
if that was the case that'll be

722
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,559
excuse the language that'll be

723
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,120
but it can also explain the high number

724
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,480
of vulnerable devices in the beginning

725
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,520
because this is something you need to

726
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,840
turn on

727
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,919
thank you very much if you need me i

728
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,120
will

729
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,350
hopefully be in the bar

730
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:13,520
[Applause]

731
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,840
doesn't keep track of when it first

732
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,960
started appearing no i just uh told john

733
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,400
2016

734
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,000
4786

735
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
and he started mapping in 2016 but right

736
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,440
now they're tracking it so you can

737
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,480
actually see it live and you can

738
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,640
actually see the exposure i mean if it

739
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,080
came with the firmware maybe all of a

740
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,480
sudden it appeared yeah no we don't have

741
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,320
data going that that far back and that

742
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,400
is the nice a big downside old old yeah

743
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,919
what do you have to censor

744
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,279
what why did you have to sense or

745
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,720
anything i mean i i understand if he's

746
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,880
using his passwords and stuff like that

747
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,159
yeah yeah i can't go through all the

748
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,640
configuration files that i found

749
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,240
basically um

750
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,440
but it's uh

751
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,679
i don't want to out any companies i

752
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,200
don't want out any

753
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,880
government

754
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,840
people or or anything or get someone in

755
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,760
trouble i'm actually here to just

756
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,120
get you guys aware of this to actually

757
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,520
help others like i've been trying to do

758
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,880
but i'm old and i'm tired and i'm

759
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,000
getting bald

760
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,960
so

761
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,960
now you're shaving yeah i have the

762
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,159
burling wall growing here

763
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,960
does anybody know about the cisco

764
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,799
report from before you check it

765
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,799
a couple people yeah

766
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,240
and search should probably have been

767
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,559
more well they got it down to 42 or did

768
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,360
you get it down to 46 if i got it on you

769
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,880
got it down to 46

770
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,760
46 still stimulate in what is it

771
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,720
yeah 46.78 yeah yeah

772
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,400
so it's um

773
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,080
it's it's

774
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,440
i don't know what to say or do it's been

775
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,159
a

776
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,919
long journey ever since

777
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,799
2016 to to actually be able to present

778
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,679
something

779
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,279
it is

780
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,600
but it's a it's a fun vulnerability i

781
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,840
would say that sounds annoying

782
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,080
we have questions from the audience

783
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,520
do we have a thomas here reading

784
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,080
questions from

785
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,840
i don't know where thomas is so i don't

786
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,880
know if there's any questions on the uh

787
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,159
slido thing but i don't see any hands

788
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,320
it's pretty self-explanatory man so in

789
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,679
that case right thank you very much

790
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,000
thank you guys
