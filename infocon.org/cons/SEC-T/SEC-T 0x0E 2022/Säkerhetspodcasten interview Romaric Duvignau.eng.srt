1
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:08,280
hi everyone we're live almost at SEC T

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,019
conference and we're still here at the

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,540
community night and uh right now we have

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,680
homework with us who gave a talk on sort

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,619
of eavesdropping on live streams or

6
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,960
maybe not live streams but streams from

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,660
from different streaming services uh

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,960
yeah and I saw the end of your talk and

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,820
my understanding is you presented magic

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,200
right that's that's the core idea here

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,239
you take something which is encrypted

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,020
yeah and you have some sort of reference

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,899
library

14
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:45,540
somehow you recognize when the same

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,180
stuff is transmitted

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,700
churches so basically what we do is that

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,980
so you can talk about live streams

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,579
because the streams are live

19
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:59,039
you eavesdrops them exactly yeah and

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,440
then you can recognize what what is

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,879
trimmed even though the streams

22
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,459
themselves are encrypted and this is

23
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,380
because of the protocols the protocol

24
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,680
that is used to download the stream

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,600
leaves some traces they leave some small

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,820
pieces here and there and thanks to

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,100
those pieces then you can retrieve the

28
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,260
video and there is

29
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,900
is this like a compression on Rachael

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,100
Laura or what what but what's what's the

31
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,960
what is it you actually are recognizing

32
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,600
you you recognize in this work that I

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,400
presented today it was to recognize the

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,320
title to recognize what what the video

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,479
is about yeah you can recognize a bit

36
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,060
more because you also know exactly where

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,100
in the video you are so basically you

38
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,560
can even reproduce What what is

39
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,619
currently being watched exactly at the

40
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:47,939
second

41
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,100
the other work that we are doing where

42
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,320
you can also classify so you can also

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,299
not recognize only the video but you can

44
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,759
also say what is it about

45
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,880
an events of our encrypted yeah so

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,920
that's that is so cool could you could

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,500
you I'm sorry to interrupt her but could

48
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,259
you sort of just elaborate on where

49
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,919
where there could be a a use for this

50
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,180
technology

51
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,340
so acceptance buying on your girlfriend

52
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,280
or you know everyone wants to do that

53
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,780
yeah yeah

54
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,660
um so that's what I try to highlight uh

55
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,120
at the end of the talk so you can either

56
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,700
be on the on the good guy side on the on

57
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,980
the bad guy side and the good guys side

58
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,099
I would say imagine that

59
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,319
um especially for example not only the

60
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,140
identification but classification you

61
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,560
are recording uh traces from Facebook

62
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,720
and you can maybe

63
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,060
um find out when people are watching

64
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,700
Terror videos yeah talks about illegal

65
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,519
content and this when you find out then

66
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,440
you want to cancel it that's a really

67
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,840
big deal on Facebook you want to stop

68
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,540
people watching illegal content that's

69
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,120
really something we want to do but you

70
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,640
can also think of the bad guys that

71
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,280
might use that to find out when you are

72
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,780
watching something that is against the

73
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,019
government yeah then I have to say then

74
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,300
you're in in between what we are trying

75
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,540
to show is that this is possible then

76
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,260
it's up to whoever is is making this

77
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,659
possible to to stop you know to update

78
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,879
the protocols cool yes you need to

79
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,519
because you're finding some sort of work

80
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,560
right there's

81
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,800
there's something like if a length or a

82
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,220
killer or we I

83
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,980
I'll let you explain in a second what

84
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,560
what the actual Oracle techniques or

85
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,140
what what it actually because you told

86
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,840
us that it's the it's related to a

87
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,080
titles and things like that yeah uh but

88
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,560
uh

89
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,799
I kind of lost my point here but but

90
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,580
uh yeah like what what would be the

91
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,640
obvious fixes against these attacks that

92
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,620
that's a really good question actually I

93
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,720
think there is not a really obvious

94
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,239
simple fix otherwise it would have

95
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,480
already be done somehow usually against

96
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,819
what what type of attacks that's what we

97
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:15,720
call

98
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,180
um in academics like passive Network

99
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,040
attacks that means that you are

100
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,919
passively listening exactly you are just

101
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,560
listening so somehow they are really

102
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,280
almost invisible to to contact to at

103
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,740
least to detect because you are not

104
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,360
interacting with the network you are

105
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,280
just listening so you cannot see they

106
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,180
are there

107
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,000
uh even though they can they can do some

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,940
heavy damages so how can you counter

109
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,280
them the basic techniques usually it's

110
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,880
you are trying to kind of Shuffle to try

111
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,340
to hide both side channels that you are

112
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,820
yeah giving away in choices the two main

113
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,680
side channels is the time of your

114
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,220
packets and the size of your packets the

115
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,380
only thing is that with the attack we've

116
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,880
shown

117
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,360
it is difficult to contact by just

118
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,060
changing these two main side channels

119
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,180
because the packet size is almost always

120
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,000
the same with streaming yeah it's almost

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,820
near the maximum size and when you look

122
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,820
at the time even if you randomize the

123
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,400
time of your packets they they're maybe

124
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,500
send like a little bit later

125
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,400
it still since the video is streamed

126
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,680
within like four seconds yeah this makes

127
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,840
me it's a hard real-time protocol

128
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,320
exactly exactly so except if we are

129
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,080
going somewhere where a protocol will

130
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,020
stream the video in kind of constant

131
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,240
bitrate where everyone's second there

132
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,759
will be the same number of bytes

133
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,620
then it will solve the problem but then

134
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,780
the compression will not be as good so

135
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,940
it's always a compromise yeah I think it

136
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,340
hasn't been like

137
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,860
predecessors to voice over iepy almost

138
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,400
kind of can reconstruct simple sounds

139
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,520
based on

140
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,259
detecting silences or something like

141
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,780
like that

142
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,940
um so uh

143
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,979
again I'm sorry sorry Peter for

144
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,500
interrupting but I'm really curious what

145
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,960
what what got you into researching this

146
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,660
that's that's a really good question I

147
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,020
think I think the very first

148
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,960
uh article I read was not a published

149
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,000
article it was like a media it was about

150
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,039
these guys that actually did something

151
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,900
very similar on Netflix

152
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,720
and I just read that and I thought wow

153
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,600
that's impressive yeah can we do it on

154
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,600
other services and I look around and it

155
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,419
was not really it doesn't be look for

156
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,280
that much and then I thought okay I'll

157
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,620
give that to some students and see if

158
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,220
that works if if that was five years ago

159
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,960
this attack that it has been shown yeah

160
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,539
and it's still working now so I think

161
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,280
it's maybe time to update this Dash

162
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,300
protocol

163
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,819
yeah so you are

164
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,919
your attack was talking about Dash

165
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,319
protocol yeah

166
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,139
um so an idiot's going to dash what's

167
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,060
what's the difference between

168
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,300
Dash and whatever else I'm not an expert

169
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,180
in streaming really but I mean in in

170
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,460
dash since you divide the video in small

171
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,880
chunks yep each chunk has a fixed size

172
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,380
as a size that corresponds to whichever

173
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,120
encoding you are using to encode that

174
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,660
chunk of the video I mean this this

175
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,720
protocol I mean uh they didn't think

176
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,000
about it maybe there was five years ago

177
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,699
that was before gdpr Etc maybe they

178
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,220
didn't think already that we cannot make

179
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,440
a protocol that gives so much precise

180
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,720
information about the video because they

181
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,599
were they were probably looking at

182
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,979
optimizing performance and things like

183
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,740
that

184
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,680
so it's very good in terms of how much

185
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,840
how it adapts to the bandwidth it's

186
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,900
really reactive all the smartness is at

187
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,259
the client so that means that it's

188
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,360
really versatile as a product as a

189
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,759
protocol it's just that it really gives

190
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,680
really precise information about the

191
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,759
video

192
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,319
all right

193
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,680
but would this be slightly similar to

194
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,440
like the an MPEG stream or something

195
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,259
yeah the dash protocol lower so the

196
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,539
difference is that when you have an MPX

197
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:32,820
stream let's like it's not stream it's

198
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,339
just you are watching a MPEG video on

199
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,620
your computer usually it will be

200
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,559
compressed right with a certain encoding

201
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,000
a certain codec

202
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,279
the the usual codec that we are using

203
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,020
now they are very good at compressing

204
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,480
videos what they use what what is called

205
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,300
viable bitrate so that means that they

206
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,120
will not use the same number of diets

207
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,300
for one second if you have one second of

208
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,820
black screen or one second of heavy

209
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,580
action you can think that one second of

210
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,640
black screen I can use really alone

211
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,279
number of bytes yes of course and heavy

212
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,440
action I will use a high higher than the

213
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,100
average

214
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,019
so the thing is that if you want to

215
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,720
compress wealthy videos you need to use

216
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,300
these viable bitrates so sometimes

217
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,300
increase sometimes decrease and that is

218
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,600
what Dash is leaking basically it's

219
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,300
looking even worse of the video itself

220
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,920
the video itself if you look every

221
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,019
second you will see this variable bit

222
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:33,480
rate but if you look every second four

223
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,459
seconds is even worse because the

224
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:39,120
difference are a bit bigger oh yeah all

225
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,959
right

226
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,480
yeah

227
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,339
um so counter measures are basically

228
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,680
redesigned the protocol yes now there

229
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,019
are protocols I think I think they will

230
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:51,720
take over soon in a couple of years so

231
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,720
we might not hear of this attack but I

232
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,339
know they also attack on both other

233
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,080
protocols because of this viable bit

234
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,360
rate so even if you have other network

235
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,760
protocol you still have this and

236
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,740
I don't know it's a compromise will you

237
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,080
compromise how much data you will have

238
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,860
to download to have this extra privacy

239
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,140
that's that's you know that's that's the

240
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,480
I'm sorry we're just backing it up yeah

241
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,660
right but uh I mean that that's the

242
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,760
compromise you need to take into account

243
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,279
you have to weigh a

244
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,519
privacy issue

245
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,519
on the same scale as your your bandwidth

246
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,560
issue basically I think that's that's

247
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,720
maybe the topic for the next

248
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,019
five or to ten years is like how much

249
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,860
performance are we willing to like

250
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,740
sacrifice to sacrifice to get better

251
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,100
privacy because because a lot of privacy

252
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,060
yeah right right

253
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,519
we don't imagine there at least when

254
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,560
we're Sweden we don't imagine an attack

255
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,079
even interested in this but but let's

256
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:02,279
say

257
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,140
but of course it's much more interesting

258
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,899
if we assume that you are in some other

259
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:11,279
place where it might but but let's say

260
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,360
like the hardest protocol to attack

261
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,140
where you couldn't inspect this without

262
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,819
let's say without uh

263
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:27,540
when it's encrypted then

264
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,420
you would want constant bit rate

265
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,980
and you would want constant size for

266
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,380
metadata so it doesn't

267
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,519
those leaks either I mean if it's like I

268
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,140
guess I'm sorry too but it's like

269
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,540
thwarting any any side Channel you need

270
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,339
to you know make everything look the

271
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,560
same kind of that's completely true

272
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,839
that's probably true but you you got a

273
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,600
point basically there are two ways of

274
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,300
making the attack either harder to

275
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,060
reproduce or try it like this constant

276
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,899
language

277
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:03,779
so harder to reproduce you said yeah

278
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,519
that's true that this attack is also

279
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,040
made easier because the dash protocol

280
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,320
you have this manifest file that gives a

281
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,180
lot of information where to retrieve the

282
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,339
information and then you can build this

283
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,519
database if you didn't have such file

284
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,260
where all the information is contained

285
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,779
it's just slower it just you will take

286
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,640
more time to find all the information

287
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,579
you need that's true for the constant

288
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,140
bit rate that will be something like

289
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,120
okay

290
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,800
that way I will not leak information

291
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,140
that would be good but the only problem

292
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,200
is for sure is that you will make

293
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,420
so either one option is that you

294
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,279
compress the video with a constant bit

295
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,200
rate so that will be you will use more

296
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,360
space you will use more data are you

297
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,800
willing to use more data to download

298
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,540
your videos

299
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,360
thinking that most people don't care

300
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,740
maybe about if someone else is watching

301
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,480
either there might be techniques that

302
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,480
that are currently investigated where

303
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,899
you can have a variable bit rate but the

304
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,760
constant bit rate will be on the on the

305
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,500
protocol so imagine that Network

306
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,079
protocol gives you not four seconds of

307
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,620
video but for like 4 000 bytes yes

308
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,320
whichever that means of video and then

309
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,180
it's the client and that will make

310
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,220
protocol much more complex because the

311
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,139
client will have not only to handle the

312
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:25,320
download but also to download to handle

313
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,260
like the playback yes you'd have to have

314
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,480
a much larger buffer probably exactly

315
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,160
exactly you have to sacrifice something

316
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,300
yeah

317
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,519
I think you mentioned students

318
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,339
right yeah so uh

319
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:41,519
you're working at the as a what what's

320
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,120
your what's your date job yeah yeah sure

321
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,220
so I'm assistant professor so that means

322
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,220
I'm giving lectures that's part of my

323
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,620
job as a teacher the other part is as a

324
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,019
researcher so this work I presented

325
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,300
today I have to thank the sixth unions

326
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,180
that did a great bashful disease so I

327
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,339
supervise them I gave them topic and

328
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,560
then they develop this tool so all of

329
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,300
this that I present today is thanks to

330
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,339
them of course cool so they are working

331
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:10,860
at Charles that's in Gothenburg yeah

332
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,500
yeah the best but that's why we asked

333
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,440
Universe of course of course my old alma

334
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,260
