1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,400
seriously we are here at SEC T

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,919
interviewing the speakers and now we

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,960
have Eric with us who just came off

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,179
stage and you were talking about uh

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,900
exploiting crypto wallets yeah yeah for

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,180
fun and no maybe not profit

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,859
we have customers yeah I understand and

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,320
so so what is your business model look

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,640
like look like

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,279
um so you take a percentage or yeah

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,679
generally so unciphered um we're a

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,540
vulnerability research company

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,280
um and so and we're very open about that

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,660
as I said on the stage we're like white

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,219
hat hackers because

16
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:39,420
um you know not a lot of people have

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,340
looked at this these code bases Hardware

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,040
bases uh and um you know it's usually

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,180
very novel

20
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,820
um and usually very time and talent and

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,739
resource intensive so it's really hard

22
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,180
to put a price on that like as an

23
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,559
example

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,180
um we have a focused ion beam in a

25
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,980
skinny electron microscope as some

26
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,020
pieces of equipment in our Electronics

27
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,719
lab and generally as I learned from

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,039
friends in the industry when I did a

29
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,359
little bit of it that they don't turn on

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,559
their equipment for less than a hundred

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,960
thousand dollars because the equipments

32
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,760
two pieces of that is about two million

33
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,040
dollars yeah so

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,619
um grandma can't afford that

35
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,720
um so we work on percentages uh

36
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,040
generally anywhere from like you know we

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,020
started 20 can go lower or higher and it

38
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,880
was really easy we're like we drop it

39
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,640
but if you go for percentages

40
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,479
uh

41
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,640
uh how do you know how much is in the

42
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,799
hardware wallet before you extract it

43
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,960
it's a good question that's a very good

44
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,159
question it's a question we get asked a

45
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,659
lot so

46
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,340
um uh we like to say we're the world's

47
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,140
first institutional

48
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,939
cryptocurrency recovery company because

49
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,500
we have a whole know your customer

50
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,259
process we have a system that checks IDs

51
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,479
and it's that person we also when we

52
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,579
have them come in we require the public

53
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,700
key so the public key in blockchain will

54
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,780
um you know let you know how much that

55
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,060
is and that also is part of our any

56
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,380
money laundering and know your wall

57
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,939
process which we get a score saying like

58
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,220
how close to dirty it is or not

59
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,540
um so we know exactly how much is on

60
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,040
there and if and if they can't provide

61
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,320
that because some incident happened uh

62
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,959
wiped it or lost access to a drive

63
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,580
um well the amount is on the blockchain

64
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,280
so if we have we do a whole basically

65
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,920
Sherlock investigation like when did you

66
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,260
get it did you mint mine it did you buy

67
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,940
it and like who like when did you like

68
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,379
do you have an email of a date so like

69
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:23,760
we narrow it down to that one until we

70
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,680
get it and then we can score it um so we

71
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,120
don't take a client

72
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,459
um with rare exception

73
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:30,720
um where the managers have to sign off

74
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,860
in that because we know exactly who it

75
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,200
is and we know yeah and so

76
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,599
um the practically every case we get the

77
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,280
public key and if we don't we don't work

78
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,900
with the person and if we don't then we

79
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,599
don't know and and

80
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,160
limit on my knowledge

81
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,760
before you start you already know which

82
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,879
private keys will be under or their are

83
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,920
there some technologies where where the

84
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,459
the wallet is locked down and when you

85
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,400
unlock it it could be like you would

86
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,800
know that you're looking for unlocking a

87
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,440
certain public key but it turns out what

88
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,159
is there 10 private keys of this wallet

89
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,019
it's another good question we get that a

90
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:13,920
lot

91
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,440
um and so before on Seifert I was

92
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,000
cracking software Wallets on the side

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,200
just like a little bit here and there

94
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,599
because I'm in San Francisco where you

95
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,319
know there

96
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,060
the crypto Mansion if you don't know

97
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,700
that it's just it's a Google thing but

98
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,200
um a lot of people were there early in

99
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,780
the days in the early 2010s uh

100
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,720
creating uh a lot of you know software

101
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,220
but also people knew me because I lived

102
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,659
there and I was like their security guy

103
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,459
so I that's what I was just doing on the

104
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,739
side outside of refereecon

105
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,840
um but for to answer your your Hardware

106
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,099
question

107
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,159
um so uh uh

108
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,500
it it really we don't have that problem

109
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,780
because our intake process covers that

110
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,340
based on what I learned in the past when

111
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,080
I wasn't doing that so I brought that

112
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,580
story up because all the learning

113
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,080
lessons of before the company got

114
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,819
started I learned how to weed that out

115
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:02,099
and also stop making those mistakes a

116
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:03,480
lot of people are saying it's hard and

117
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,920
possible to do it's just like well no

118
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,599
it's not you just got to be rigorous and

119
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,920
actually run professionally if you don't

120
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,879
do that you're going to get in trouble

121
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,260
and people are doing that and getting in

122
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,239
trouble so we made sure we're not going

123
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,400
to get in trouble

124
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,639
so and no we have but here's the thing

125
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:20,279
we have found wallets with extra

126
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,139
coins in there they didn't know are

127
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,780
forgot so we'll often find in like uh

128
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,280
Treasures hidden wallets so if you

129
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,840
provide a password it'll just open a

130
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,520
wallet it could be empty or one with a

131
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,780
little amount of money

132
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,820
for duress like oh I only have this much

133
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,440
and here's the key and it opens it and

134
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,300
they won't see that there's another wall

135
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,220
if it's bigger and so we have code that

136
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,660
will iterate through

137
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,740
um in Brute Force at least some

138
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,840
treasures passphrases and we've gotten

139
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,400
hits where like we found another thirty

140
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,840
thousand dollars that the person forgot

141
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,639
about and it was theirs

142
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,560
um but that's because of you know that

143
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,479
you know the extended Keys allow for

144
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:52,620
that

145
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,360
um so hopefully that answers your

146
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,919
question yeah

147
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,919
there's times where we will find more

148
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:00,960
um but it's generally the the customers

149
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,380
already yeah but but basically the

150
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,000
The Human Side and the admission

151
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,919
weeds out that we are the customers we

152
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,780
have a lot of rejections yeah yeah a lot

153
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,639
of rejections rejections that other

154
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,900
people should easily find but they don't

155
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,160
do the work so we're just like we can't

156
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,720
work for those people it's just so much

157
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,199
liability like we had yeah yeah so

158
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,300
someone comes up I don't know before I

159
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,960
don't know how to get the internet we

160
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,180
time it's it's not helpful for us to

161
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,280
argue no um we just say it's too hard to

162
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,080
work on yeah yeah and if someone hears

163
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,220
that it may actually it's very often the

164
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,039
case well every case is always free the

165
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,259
scope we will always look at everything

166
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,360
um and and we can do it very well and

167
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,639
maybe not today also um and sometimes in

168
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,560
the future we can crack it so maybe like

169
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,759
because we had a wall for sitting for

170
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,840
eight months and then we looked at it

171
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,880
again and then we opened it

172
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,380
yeah

173
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,199
and this one yeah I think you mentioned

174
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,479
that they're they're not like at fifth

175
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:00,600
levels or no no none of them are no no

176
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,000
no listen I mean people use iron keys

177
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,280
but that they get an iron key and if

178
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,199
they do there's a famous case where

179
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,300
someone has 7 000 Bitcoin locked up and

180
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,800
two password attempts left we'd love to

181
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,940
chat with them because we built a

182
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,919
roadmap to attack it but that is a fips

183
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,780
device and it is a very difficult one

184
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,180
but we have some interesting um

185
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,100
development so if anyone wants to put us

186
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,900
in front of uh Stefan who has seven

187
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,220
thousand Bitcoin we'd love to have a

188
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,860
chat cool yeah so when

189
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,940
when when you talk about the like

190
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,160
like there's some

191
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,259
a couple of common container profiles

192
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,060
but there was she

193
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,120
I'm not usually in these devices or

194
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,680
so so it basically like like in

195
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,259
we just don't want to make the micro

196
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:51,060
process to arrange a lot to the SR yeah

197
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,340
well there's also as you know like when

198
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,900
they say secure element there's

199
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,060
different things that can air quote make

200
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,819
it a secure element like uh you know it

201
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:00,900
you know as soon as you have security

202
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,280
meshes and if you breach the security

203
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,440
mesh when it powers on it realizes that

204
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,240
the the mesh has been damaged wait

205
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,380
memory

206
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,880
um so like that's why we have a very

207
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,440
invasive methods with the you know the

208
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,360
focused ion beam is a tool for edits and

209
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,160
so we can if we know that chip we get

210
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,840
like 100 of them and then build a

211
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,280
methodology and then we're like okay now

212
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,380
we go to Target and that may have like

213
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,880
10 million dollars on it you don't want

214
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,099
to make one mistake on that you know so

215
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:24,180
we make sure like we have a diamond

216
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,060
lapidary machine that we a lot of as I

217
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,500
said people use nitric acid with their

218
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,060
finger and have scars but we do Micron

219
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,280
at a time and they're very careful cool

220
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,840
so and we won't take the work unless we

221
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,300
know we can do it love to visit that lab

222
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,940
I know sorry no tourists not right now I

223
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,500
mean we may have a demo lab in the

224
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,360
future but yeah right now

225
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,800
um yeah there's there's security

226
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,560
concerns but uh and as you if you go to

227
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,360
you if you go to Google and type uh

228
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,639
Bitcoin uh kidnapping GitHub there's a

229
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,139
whole repo that has every published

230
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,160
known

231
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,900
Ransom kidnap something for that and

232
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,219
it's just it's a real thing yeah

233
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,199
there there is uh Hardware wallet it's

234
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,759
named

235
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,880
super secure X should have a new name of

236
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,880
this one here and

237
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,139
tomorrow you get the customers as uh

238
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,819
I I have a money in this and I can't get

239
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,240
that and this is the first time you have

240
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,400
this device I give a first personal

241
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,259
process would be

242
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,860
buying those and compare them to known

243
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,779
reference signs you haven't checked in

244
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,779
before yep yep and if it's completely

245
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,779
new let's say there there's some

246
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,520
processor or something here we haven't

247
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,140
seen it there's a lot we haven't seen

248
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,140
this is so much so what's the next

249
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,019
approach I mean do you get

250
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:52,100
15 of those and starts

251
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,959
poking around like a little bit of

252
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,500
approach to a new device yeah so

253
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,060
um you know we have a variety of

254
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,640
non-invasive tools but depending on uh

255
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,680
uh you know the pro the node process is

256
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,080
it like a 90 nanometer 20 nanometer it

257
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,459
depends some chips are much more

258
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,260
sophisticated so you can't like we just

259
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,240
got a nano CT machine

260
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,300
um but that won't show you the gates

261
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,880
um so generally uh if it's a new chip

262
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,620
and it's you know it's

263
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,240
we read the documentation first that's

264
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,860
public because a lot of it it's all NDA

265
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,320
for a lot of like atmel 98 SCS at you

266
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,920
know

267
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,839
very NDA documentation you couldn't get

268
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,220
easily unless you were like a partner

269
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,839
vendor and blah blah blah

270
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,160
um that people have leaked stuff like

271
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,839
that uh but you know new chips come out

272
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,220
and you may not have that like Infinity

273
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,620
on or other other chips out there that

274
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,940
are you know they spend a lot of time

275
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,200
and money and they're put into like you

276
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,339
know military systems and other things

277
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:43,320
that you really care

278
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,080
um and so we'll buy yeah like 15 20 100

279
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,660
depending and then we delayer them build

280
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,820
a workup and so we know exactly what it

281
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,140
looks like but those chips are gone

282
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,060
those are obliterated yeah and So

283
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,440
eventually we slowly work through that

284
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,120
process and we're like oh okay where's

285
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,980
you know uh how's the power on where's

286
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,660
the keying is it have Glitch protections

287
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,220
or detection

288
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,279
um basically what are the security

289
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,019
um countermeasures in there yeah and

290
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:08,100
then we're like then we build a step

291
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,019
around that or not and then we go you

292
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,339
know it could be glitching it could be

293
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,260
and maybe we can just like you know

294
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,760
dissolve the packaging and realize

295
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,019
there's a quick trick we can it just

296
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,120
depends or sometimes it's super invasive

297
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,760
and dangerous and it may take you know a

298
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,140
week or two or three once we get the

299
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,399
methodology and the methodology maybe

300
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,440
that we slowly like you know dissolve

301
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,839
the epoxy off the device which we've we

302
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,100
come up with the custom chemical

303
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,920
solution for epoxies that's very

304
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,420
dangerous but it actually cleanly pulls

305
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,220
the epoxies off and we get the board you

306
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,839
know we plug in we take the nand off

307
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,839
mirror it it just depends on how it's

308
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,540
set up and like uh

309
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,200
again it's like it's implementation

310
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,640
specific but

311
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,860
so yeah starting with yeah we'll buy 20

312
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,540
or 30 or 40 of those things and then

313
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,140
just slowly build that up cool I was I

314
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,480
was thinking about one one uh one

315
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,519
problem that you touched on in your talk

316
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,660
yeah and that was I mean crypto is is uh

317
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,899
you know purposely built hard to crack

318
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:11,160
today but give it a couple of years and

319
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,320
and crypto becomes weaker and weaker and

320
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,260
weaker and and I guess that will become

321
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,200
a huge problem in in

322
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,940
protecting your your crypto wallets so

323
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,200
would

324
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,720
what would your take beyond that like if

325
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,260
if you if you really wanted to have a

326
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,779
you're secure is it moving towards new

327
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:35,940
technology all the time and moving your

328
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,660
your money or should you

329
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,200
stick with uh you know some other method

330
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,300
so I I think you're touching on the

331
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,360
point of the quote on a long enough time

332
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,220
Horizon every Pepto wallet becomes

333
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,500
vulnerable from Chris weisable I was

334
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,300
opal I think he's correcting me

335
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,680
um

336
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,100
yeah so as we've seen in our industries

337
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,399
that you know uh

338
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,260
sometimes you see everyone using the

339
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,339
same key or they you know didn't use a a

340
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:10,860
large enough entropy pool and the cube

341
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,120
is very weak and you can return State

342
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,100
yeah those are you know implementation

343
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,660
faults there but we're seeing those at

344
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,700
larger scale right now in crypto wallets

345
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,040
so like everyone uses a main project and

346
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,380
they Fork it and they say this is my new

347
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,200
super secure insert flashy name and logo

348
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,800
uh not a rug pull Ico or like not a not

349
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,260
a scam wallet and but if you go to

350
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,180
Android or uh iOS there's a lot of scan

351
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,440
wallets that will just like pretend to

352
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,940
be others and yank your money we've seen

353
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,959
that

354
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,720
um but we're we're we're we're we're

355
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,000
pretty astonished of the of the volume

356
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,399
and growing volume of

357
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,500
wallets that

358
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,680
um either the main wallet implementation

359
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,839
that people forked uh you know generated

360
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,880
Keys correctly so you know he did the

361
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,639
universe you know key attempts but we're

362
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,260
seeing more often than not on every

363
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,899
project some some issue where the key

364
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,300
space is dramatically reduced yeah and

365
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,399
so in some cases we're able to generate

366
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,220
key Pairs and with real money

367
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,440
um and so going forward

368
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,959
um we've found as in like my talk with

369
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,899
ethereum wallet it was in 2017.

370
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:20,040
um if we had found the flaw at the time

371
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,600
nowhere to look

372
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,000
um we we may have been able to see the

373
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,040
15 000 ethereum in the wallets live

374
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,139
they've moved off as I said in the talk

375
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:29,160
but

376
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,600
we have seen already more of these

377
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,100
already with that are currently loaded

378
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,440
at various sums and I think more people

379
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,180
are going to know to look for them and

380
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,800
we're we're really ahead of the curve

381
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,660
right now and so we're

382
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,160
we're putting up some concept called

383
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,779
responsible rescue yeah that's what I

384
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:44,399
was going to say that's that's where uh

385
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,800
where your responsible rescue comes in

386
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,380
yeah and you you want to be able to move

387
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,660
that money in a responsible way and yeah

388
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,480
yeah and and it's like I I think for

389
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,700
your listeners viewers

390
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,320
um so people know responsible disclosure

391
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,000
coordinated disclosure

392
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,680
um we know that very well um but the

393
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,240
problem is uh you can go patch the

394
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,399
software the keys are still minted yes

395
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,839
and if you don't move that money they're

396
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,300
still vulnerable and so we're seeing

397
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,100
much larger than the Thousand change

398
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,720
wallets we saw and we're going through

399
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,100
this process and realizing we're at a

400
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,560
really a big blocker right now because

401
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,940
if we disclose to the major offenders

402
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,800
yeah they'll fix it but if anyone knows

403
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,959
then you're going to see like the Solana

404
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,459
and Nomad attacks and other ones like

405
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,019
200 million dollars go missing all of a

406
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,600
sudden and we're we don't want to harm

407
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,820
into some people and if we move the

408
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,860
wallets that we find or anyone else does

409
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,540
it's a felony in the U.S

410
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,639
um and so we're we don't have a solution

411
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,920
yet we are starting to talk with

412
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,019
lawmakers in DC to say how can we do

413
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,399
this this is like

414
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,740
north of 100 million here or this or

415
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,300
that or some large number and some are

416
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,880
tinier but there's a lot of innocent

417
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,260
people that don't know that their money

418
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,699
is about to be stolen or could be stolen

419
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,560
so we're at the very beginning of this

420
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,500
topic but since you could you could for

421
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,339
example if yeah your recovery wallet

422
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,600
address and then

423
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:05,519
automatically translated there and then

424
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,899
you need to prove that you were the

425
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,420
owner to FBI to get them back or that's

426
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,220
one idea that people have been passing

427
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,540
around in the office and people were

428
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,699
talking with maybe not the FBI those are

429
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:16,380
generally for criminal cases and they

430
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,600
they um they they you know do need

431
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,060
support for clearly criminal cases um

432
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,920
but we're talking now who do you talk to

433
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,139
and and how does this work for you have

434
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:27,060
maybe like two Bad actors in The in that

435
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,800
vendor class and then you have like a

436
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,480
ten thousand dollars but but the problem

437
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,820
is I mean if this is a good debate yeah

438
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,560
this is a great debate yeah but I mean

439
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,600
before the answer the problem there and

440
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,740
what if it's also wait here's one more

441
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,560
what if you're Swedish I was going to

442
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,300
say that let's say there's we don't know

443
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,060
this Russian guy who has a legitimately

444
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,000
earned his Bitcoins or or ethereums

445
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,500
there's really good people in Russia

446
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,000
yeah actually the vast majority I think

447
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,480
yeah I'm sure there are uh and anyway

448
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,120
there are there are objectives

449
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,880
okay this guy in Iran and I'm I'm pretty

450
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,220
sure he wouldn't or she wouldn't like

451
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,959
the security is an Exchange Commission

452
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,300
in the U.S you know sees their money and

453
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,220
they have to prove it's theirs this is

454
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,019
this is this is you're nailing on the

455
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:10,740
head

456
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,300
um because it's all decentralized or

457
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,620
most a lot of the systems are just

458
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,940
centralized there's a lot of misnomers

459
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,500
about how some are constructed and if

460
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,120
you have a metamask it's not centralized

461
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,519
like you're going through the uh infer

462
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,320
uh consensus API and they see every

463
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,579
transaction

464
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,920
um and open c can Seize Your nft so um

465
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,000
you're not writing to the blockchain

466
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,320
directly uh for those but um correct

467
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,360
this is why I put my email out there for

468
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,100
like contact me we have a lot of people

469
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,720
discussing this we need to discuss it

470
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,639
and figure this out

471
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,100
because as I said uh Bob gorley at ooda

472
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,160
Loop has a a growing air table of thefts

473
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,959
and heists and hacks and bad coding

474
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,279
errors like you saw one recently that

475
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,320
lost 37 million dollars because of a

476
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,579
actual coding error in the smart

477
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,440
contract so

478
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,779
It's A Brave New World

479
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,220
um this didn't exist at all in history

480
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,279
before and so I it'd be interesting to

481
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,540
see in the next year two or three or

482
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,120
four where this is going to go

483
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,780
basically what crypto brings here is

484
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,459
decentralization so you don't

485
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,799
necessarily know who to talk to

486
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,699
and you also do vulnerabilities on the

487
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,160
decentralized thing yeah so that's

488
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,740
completely different from all scenarios

489
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,980
we had before because it's always been a

490
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,099
trusted Warden by conservative which has

491
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,780
been like

492
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,140
the manager or something yeah

493
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,460
so

494
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,080
um I know I know we're not supposed to

495
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,600
do Shameless plugs but I I'm I'm I'm

496
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,299
guessing that you you have looked at all

497
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,820
kinds of devices are there any like

498
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,320
Hardware wallets that you would

499
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,050
recommend

500
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,119
[Music]

501
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:50,580
um

502
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,919
go I mean honestly I would not look at

503
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,360
any of the crypto Hardware devices until

504
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,280
they get PIP certified or yeah a high

505
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,860
eal number I think I think Ledger has an

506
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,440
eal but no one has a fips 140 level four

507
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,840
level three like get an iron key it's

508
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,280
clear if someone out there has 7 000

509
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,460
Bitcoin looking for them uh Stefan let's

510
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,539
chat

511
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:10,860
um that's my plug

512
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,600
um but he isn't on an iron Q of two

513
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,840
password attempts left and uh that that

514
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,400
like that is very likely like someone

515
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,960
could screw up and wipe out 300 million

516
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,580
dollars yeah or whatever the value is

517
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,539
today

518
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,400
um so if you want something secure and

519
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,559
like you want to make darn sure no one

520
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:28,679
can get into it or without a extremely

521
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,919
well financed and talent resourced group

522
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,480
which is what we're bringing to the

523
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,500
table

524
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,820
um not individual Hodge projects like

525
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,039
we've professionalized all of this uh

526
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,539
and so

527
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,940
um it's hard to say it's be I would look

528
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,960
at this

529
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,640
are you storing fifty thousand dollars

530
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,900
at home under the mattress or ten

531
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,120
million dollars because a 70 treasure

532
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,559
one is not going to cut it when you go

533
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,000
to a major Bank when they have a

534
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,380
thousand security Engineers do you think

535
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,059
you're gonna do better so I cannot

536
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,039
recommend any uh I can't I mean they're

537
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,960
useful in many ways I mean for small

538
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,520
amounts

539
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,140
um you mean obviously get an iron a

540
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,000
steel plate and they sell the kits on

541
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,140
Amazon where you can put your key down

542
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,400
put it in a safety deposit box

543
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,740
I'm not saying they're bad I I mean it

544
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,000
just

545
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,600
um

546
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,419
because I worked with a lot of people in

547
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:17,700
various levels of income and like some

548
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,320
very large amounts of commas at the end

549
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,580
of theirs and working with them on

550
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,980
estate planning yeah

551
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,460
no no I've never

552
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,740
I've never even owned one single crypto

553
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,380
of any currency but but then we have to

554
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,880
depending like

555
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,400
if you would want a hardware wallet I

556
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,419
mean

557
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:38,120
uh

558
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,000
would be to go to a certify and encrypt

559
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,640
the processor yeah but yes yes they're

560
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,020
starting to do that because they have so

561
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,340
much they're making so much money these

562
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,480
vendors now they're actually some are

563
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,520
making custom chips and some are

564
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,960
actually I mean so there's there's now

565
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,820
like a lot we have lost track of how

566
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,860
many different crypto Hardware tokens

567
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,720
there are period out there so like some

568
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,400
are actually doing them but like people

569
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,840
haven't come in so we just don't have

570
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,419
the bandwidth at the time but um if you

571
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:04,919
want to really secure a vast amount

572
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,860
first is like sure get a fifth 144 level

573
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,100
3 device get them on Amazon load it but

574
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,600
be aware that you may lose all of it

575
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,000
very easily other ones are easier but um

576
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,620
then also it's not just where you it's

577
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,360
not just that it's where do you store it

578
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,360
what is it a safety deposit box or is it

579
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,179
yeah that's probably the problem man how

580
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,100
to not lose your Hardware device yeah

581
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,840
yeah well you can actually split you can

582
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,820
copy the keys in multiple devices so

583
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,039
like you maybe you have five iron keys

584
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,140
so you have no chance later

585
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,240
um

586
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,160
sure there's there's different in the

587
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,039
multi-sig the other thing I'm thinking

588
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,320
of I'm not saying don't buy the the the

589
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,320
less they are less secure devices yeah

590
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,260
um but but but what's your threat model

591
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,880
are you throwing fifty thousand dollars

592
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,860
a hundred thousand dollars great if

593
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,480
you're storing like I'll ask this

594
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,980
question for the audience what do you do

595
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,360
when you have a thousand Euros in cash

596
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,379
where do you put it yeah

597
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,480
it fits the 500 euro notes they still

598
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,700
have no it goes to the bank but but like

599
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,200
so you can have Bank level security at

600
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,120
your house so just consider that it's

601
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,200
not that they're bad it's just

602
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,559
considered the context

603
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,320
devices that do like putting the same

604
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,580
complex key animation schemes so that uh

605
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,880
I mean attacks without knowing the key

606
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,900
would

607
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,600
I mean basically rely on a crypto proof

608
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,659
that it would be super expensive to do

609
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,760
the attack even if you can see it or

610
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,500
sure yeah

611
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,400
yeah

612
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,020
um sorry what is the question sorry no

613
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,500
no I'm just wondering I mean

614
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,000
with the devices aren't built so that

615
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,159
someone with a good Hardware

616
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:49,020
understanding

617
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,760
you still would have like a

618
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,700
cryptographic

619
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,880
protection against bypasses

620
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,919
yeah I mean that's why I say go with go

621
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,960
with an iron key yeah they're they're

622
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,720
very durable they I mean they're very

623
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,120
they're they're designed for that

624
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,380
um like you know you have like you know

625
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,059
they they had cryptographers who

626
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:11,880
properly implemented uh their um King

627
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,140
system

628
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,640
um it's very much like a heat death of

629
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,380
the universe problem there if you don't

630
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,940
have that passphrase even if like as

631
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,440
we're looking at it

632
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,720
um even if let's say like I don't think

633
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,159
we have a process where we can mirror

634
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:24,480
the nand even though that's encrypted

635
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,559
before it gets there and some of the

636
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,419
models uh we still need the Crypt off

637
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:30,000
the chip and even then uh if we can pull

638
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,320
it off which means we've defeated the

639
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,600
counter and we can parallelize that well

640
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,700
how big is the passphrase for that and

641
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,299
it's AES uh like CBC CBC or XTS or

642
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:42,000
something else that's hard yep and so

643
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,020
that's what I'm saying like that's hard

644
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,640
you can go get one of those uh the other

645
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,840
one's not so much at the moment

646
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,440
it's a great one um apricorns are great

647
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,659
too the keypad um but yeah or you can

648
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:56,400
just why don't you just you know true

649
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,740
Crypt or you know encrypted file like

650
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,419
why don't you here's the thing USB

651
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:02,700
sticks are great just properly encrypt

652
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,200
the file and then anyone can have you

653
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,179
can put it on the internet and then you

654
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:08,100
know again like as long as you trust the

655
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,020
software encryption then you don't the

656
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,940
hardware I think it's useful

657
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,620
I think a lot there's a vast majority of

658
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,360
them are really gimmicky

659
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,820
some vendors are really trying yeah so

660
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,620
it's but it's also a matter of like

661
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,840
what's more convenient for the user at

662
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,820
the end of the day yeah and I think

663
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,440
that's that's the trade-off I mean

664
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,820
you're you're looking at you know

665
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,880
selling these devices to people who

666
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,460
don't want to mess with software

667
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,919
cryptography and uh you know yeah do

668
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:36,780
things like that they feel this you know

669
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,640
this little device that

670
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,820
they authenticate to it it does all that

671
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:46,080
black magic for them and yeah so um I

672
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,820
think there's um

673
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,520
there's a market Niche there that you

674
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,559
know needs to be satisfied

675
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,860
I mean we when we we looked in market

676
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,299
research over the last year I put

677
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:00,059
together my team we looked at and based

678
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:01,500
on like here's a question for both of

679
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,080
you it was a really hard question

680
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,240
have you ever lost a password before oh

681
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,120
yes

682
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,380
oh yes do you have parents who have lost

683
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,780
passwords oh yes so but I can usually

684
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,600
get around those usually yeah usually

685
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,940
but then

686
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,480
a good story around that and that's uh

687
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,919
I think I had had quite high workload

688
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,980
and other things and I have my phone set

689
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,179
to implode on 10. choices

690
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,940
and then I

691
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,500
I kind of knew the the the password but

692
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,640
then I got

693
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,880
I woke up and and something like my

694
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,000
brain was not in a good State they have

695
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,320
psychics for this in the US they have a

696
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,720
lot of OG crypto people who have have

697
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,000
hired psychics I found out yeah and

698
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,200
hypnotists and varying quality

699
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,960
but uh I was kind of sure about roughly

700
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,960
what my password was but the phone ended

701
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,000
up imploding oh no

702
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,299
no no no there was a lot of things which

703
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,340
didn't have any back caps on that one

704
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,140
yeah but no crypto

705
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,419
yeah well I mean we also have a lab for

706
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:16,860
water damage funds but the phone

707
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,539
literally fell off the boat we've

708
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,640
actually had this come in and we're like

709
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,480
fell off the boat

710
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:26,640
legitimate legitimately we can actually

711
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,020
check they owned a phone and everything

712
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,039
and

713
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,900
um yeah we you know don't start the

714
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,179
phone we can pull the chips socket them

715
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:35,700
dump memory you know work through that

716
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,960
um but again there are things where we

717
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,760
just it's impossible and we have cases

718
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,279
where like we're sorry

719
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,799
um we we have exhausted this uh well

720
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:45,900
beyond I think anyone else's standard uh

721
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,700
in other if you go to any of the firm do

722
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,039
it like but I think we I think we did a

723
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:51,659
really good job on this one

724
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:52,799
um

725
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,220
yeah so um yeah cool oh sorry back to

726
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,600
the password yeah so I didn't go with

727
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,460
the numbers so we look we looked at the

728
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,080
market and we published on in a press

729
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,700
release but like uh depending on the

730
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,320
month we said there's probably about 300

731
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,880
billion dollars in missing crypto at

732
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,760
that time in Bitcoin and ethereum

733
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,260
um and that's just in January now

734
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,000
obviously it went down to 100 billion

735
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,220
but uh that's still still a lot of money

736
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,779
a lot of money out there that needs to

737
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:17,279
be put back into the system if people

738
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,620
want to use it yeah cool I think we can

739
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,299
sit here and talk about this you know

740
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:23,880
