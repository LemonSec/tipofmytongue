1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,440
it works yes great

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,919
uh so i'm gonna as always mentioned

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,320
earlier gonna argue about the october

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,160
hack that we have so

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,320
scan the code i'm going to talk about

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,960
some research

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,279
regarding a configuration manager from

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,760
microsoft that i've been doing uh in

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,080
recent time and some tooling around that

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
so a little bit about me

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,480
my name is thomas repka i am a senior

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,120
iot security consultant at with secure

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,160
former

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,440
f-secure

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,520
and i've been doing id security for too

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,160
long and pam testing

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,800
everything but i mostly focus on network

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,920
security and active directory stuff but

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,719
i do a lot of things but on to today's

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,559
topic

21
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,160
which is

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,160
a configuration manager so what is

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,559
configuration manager it's a product

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,960
from microsoft used in uh corporate

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,559
environments

26
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,359
and it was actually released in 1994 the

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,680
first version but they changed the name

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,720
uh a few times most of us know it by a

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,000
system center configuration manager sccm

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,240
uh microsoft has renamed it to endpoint

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,080
configuration manager

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,040
and now

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,479
most of us say

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,720
configuration manager only and the main

35
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,119
features are

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,439
operating system deployment so in a

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,280
corporate network

38
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,840
if you network boot your client it will

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,119
start up an

40
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,520
operating installation and perform tasks

41
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,600
to join it to the domain and

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,119
and stuff like that

43
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,200
so that's one part and we also have the

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,799
software distribution

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,560
i'm sure you have seen the software

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,119
center where you can

47
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,399
go in

48
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,320
to your pc and install software that's

49
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,000
available in the the corporate

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,439
environment

51
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,680
and that that is all run by the secm and

52
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,280
it has a bunch of other features but i'm

53
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
not going going into that

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,119
so we have like a server side and we

55
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,840
have a client side of this

56
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,680
solution but i'm going to focus on the

57
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,280
content library so what is the content

58
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,479
library

59
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,840
well that's everything that an

60
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,318
administrator puts in the sccm available

61
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,760
for clients

62
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,959
or endpoints such as

63
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,239
installation images or windows

64
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,040
application packages and scripts

65
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,920
and endpoints fetch these files over

66
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,720
http or hps or smb

67
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,280
so that's the three three main

68
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,920
transfer protocols uh one thing to note

69
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,319
is that domain users have default read

70
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,160
access to everything on the content

71
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
library

72
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,319
which is kind of interesting

73
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,959
so why would why would you want to

74
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,360
have a look at this well

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,680
you can find interesting things in here

76
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,080
because administrators and application

77
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,760
developers love to put credentials

78
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,440
everywhere they like to put them in

79
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,120
scripts in

80
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,720
applications

81
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,120
they like to put certificates on these

82
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,239
shares

83
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,560
api keys you name it

84
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,319
you can also find in interesting

85
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,239
information if you're doing like

86
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,159
reconnaissance and want to find other

87
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,840
shares that's exposed in the in the

88
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,280
environment

89
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,879
that you usually wouldn't know about you

90
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,560
can find them in scripts and say okay

91
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,360
here's the ite support having a share

92
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,800
somewhere that's

93
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,319
have a lot of good things that you want

94
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,239
to have a look at

95
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,800
and you can find the application

96
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,720
api endpoints and network ports and

97
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,239
stuff like that

98
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,040
but you can also go the extra mile and

99
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,959
download the applications

100
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:33,840
and

101
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,599
reverse engineer them and look at them

102
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,480
what what do these applications contain

103
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,959
maybe you have hard coded credentials

104
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,799
maybe you can find stuff like net

105
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,959
remoting services which are easy to

106
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,599
exploit over the network yeah stuff like

107
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,760
that

108
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,360
so uh

109
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,319
um my research has been focusing on the

110
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,799
sccm content lib which we

111
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,640
when you do a network penetration test

112
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,799
you you can come across and you look

113
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,599
into this and what what what is this

114
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,120
so if you do

115
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,280
it's a hidden share

116
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,439
so if you do netview

117
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,680
slash all you can view the shares on the

118
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,319
ssm server and you see that we have sm

119
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,160
content lib shader

120
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,238
so what does it contain well it's when

121
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,160
you start looking at it it's just a

122
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,479
bunch of folders and files and you

123
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,960
it's hard to grasp but microsoft

124
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,840
actually documented

125
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,479
it so we have a data lib that's only a

126
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,960
reference

127
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,560
that contains the original file name

128
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,240
dot ini

129
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,759
and that's not the actual file that's

130
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,400
stored it's just a reference and that

131
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,240
ini file is a text file that contains

132
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,800
the hash of the original file

133
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,720
the original file is stored in the file

134
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,960
lib

135
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,759
with the name of the hash so

136
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,479
it's a sha-256 hash

137
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,840
uh and there is uh they are still stored

138
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,040
in a folder with the force first charge

139
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,160
of the hash so you will go into the file

140
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,600
label you will see

141
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,520
a lot of folders with just four

142
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,360
characters and on them you will find the

143
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,039
files the actual files that are stored

144
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:15,759
so

145
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,280
when you're doing a pen test or a red

146
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,720
team it can be

147
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,240
hard to

148
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
and complex to extract

149
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,800
useful information from this so i built

150
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,080
a powershell script called sim loot

151
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,280
that will help you perform

152
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,280
recon in in this situations

153
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,759
so you import the module

154
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,680
in powershell and then you first run an

155
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,039
inventory

156
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,680
that will go into the

157
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,600
data library and just list all the files

158
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,000
that available that the reference files

159
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,520
so it knows what content that is

160
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,039
available and stores them in a text file

161
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,080
and

162
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,440
that is

163
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,960
pretty basic it's not it's nothing

164
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,199
advanced at all

165
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,520
you can then use the download

166
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,720
functionality of the script

167
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,360
so you can fetch individual files or you

168
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,840
can fetch

169
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,080
extensions for instance like in this

170
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,319
case we say to the script use the

171
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,800
inventory file and pull all the xml

172
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,160
files out of the ssm content library and

173
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,600
it will download it to your local

174
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,919
computer and rename the file so that you

175
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,280
know what it is and you can have a look

176
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,080
at it

177
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,599
and find interesting stuff

178
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,080
so

179
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,280
in the default case as i said before

180
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,479
uh

181
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,280
all domain users can read

182
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,960
the files stored on these directories

183
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,639
microsoft implemented some kind of

184
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,120
access control here that i had a look at

185
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,000
which is kind of interesting so when you

186
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,919
install a package or distribute the

187
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,240
package within the the configuration

188
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
manager environment

189
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,479
you can configure access accounts so in

190
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,039
this case we have configured that

191
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,840
uh the group sccm secret app has read

192
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,039
access

193
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,639
to this package

194
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,360
so only those

195
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,520
in that active directory group should be

196
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,960
able to

197
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,758
access the file

198
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,759
so if we try to go to the content

199
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,400
library and access the data library and

200
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,639
go into that folder we get access denied

201
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,160
great it works as

202
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,520
it should

203
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,039
or maybe

204
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,039
if we reverse this action and look at

205
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,840
the actual file

206
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,919
that story in the file lib you can see

207
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,840
here we have the hash of the file that's

208
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,359
the file on the top

209
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,440
we can actually access that file and

210
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,599
when we look it in

211
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,919
it also has a corresponding ini file and

212
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,000
that will point back to the the data

213
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,639
library folder so we can connect them

214
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,639
together

215
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,840
so

216
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,680
if we look on the access rights on this

217
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,080
file we see that okay sdcm users can

218
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,639
read this file and that it is a local

219
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,599
group on the sscm server which by

220
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,720
default

221
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,479
contains the domain

222
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,960
users so everyone can read this file

223
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,039
even though we have

224
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,680
set an acl on it

225
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,960
so

226
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,980
this

227
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,199
[Music]

228
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,400
is i implemented this in in cm loot last

229
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,759
week so

230
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,400
it can help you find these inaccessible

231
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,599
files

232
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,719
so when you do the inventory it will

233
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,760
note

234
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,599
when it can't access a data label

235
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,320
directory and put it in a file called

236
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,640
the no access so you have the output

237
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,399
file underscore no access.text

238
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,080
then you can use the cm loot hunt

239
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
functionality to

240
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,399
have it go through all the folders in

241
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,760
the file lib

242
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,399
and try to discover

243
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,760
what

244
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,200
the content is that is related to the

245
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,959
content that the administrator is trying

246
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,240
to to protect because this is something

247
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,920
they want to hide this might be

248
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,319
interesting

249
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,920
so

250
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,880
the next feature of cmloot

251
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,040
is the extract feature which can be

252
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,240
handy if you

253
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,560
download all the msi files

254
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,519
that are stored on the sccm

255
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,640
msi file is the usual package to

256
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,560
create installation packages for windows

257
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,839
so you can point this to a directory and

258
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,959
it will extract all the msi file and the

259
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,040
contents in them

260
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,519
so in this case

261
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,200
we took the

262
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,480
the file that we downloaded in the

263
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,760
previous step the the hidden secret file

264
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,640
and

265
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,959
because i know that it's it is an msi

266
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,279
file i extracted it with the extract

267
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,959
functionality

268
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,040
and as we see we can see that we have

269
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,399
access to the secret app.exe

270
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,360
here

271
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,279
and we have an application configuration

272
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,640
for that application

273
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,399
so if we look into this

274
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,560
application configuration we see oh we

275
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,040
have a username and a password domain

276
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,600
administrator

277
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,720
it's uh yeah it can happen i

278
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
had uh

279
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,200
success with its method extracting msi

280
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,040
files just the last weeks

281
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,360
finding credentials not giving domain

282
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,839
administrator but server administrative

283
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,160
rights for the specific solution so this

284
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,640
is actually out there in in the wild so

285
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,839
you should

286
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,640
should look for it

287
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,800
so

288
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,040
the conclusion of this do not store

289
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,839
sensitive information as in

290
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,279
go through your stuff

291
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,320
pull out the

292
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,160
the things that shouldn't be there

293
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,399
uh use this tool if you want to

294
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,399
so yeah

295
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,240
i have some minutes left so i can talk

296
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,519
about some other tools that i have

297
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,800
sometimes you

298
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,160
discover variables.dat files on the sccm

299
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,640
servers or under other shares

300
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,680
these are usually encrypted

301
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,680
but i found out the default encryption

302
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,680
key so you can decrypt the files and

303
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,519
have a look at in them and they're just

304
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,839
xml files but they can contain domain

305
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,279
credentials and

306
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,600
and other user stuff so

307
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,279
it's good to

308
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,600
have a look at it

309
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,160
also want to uh shout out to some other

310
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,640
research that be done recently

311
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,240
uh such as the pxc thief uh our friends

312
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,760
in south africa former with secure

313
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,120
that's released the tool on devcon

314
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,480
that can pull out domain neon

315
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,240
credentials directly from the pxc

316
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,079
environment

317
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,360
which can

318
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,160
those accounts can sometimes be sccm

319
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,040
admins or even domain

320
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,200
admins uh you also should look into

321
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,920
tools like sharp s exams that can do

322
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,680
relaying and capturing credentials from

323
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,760
the ssm environment

324
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,720
um mal secm is a tool to

325
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,079
do red team

326
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,959
activities once you have administrative

327
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,360
access to the secm

328
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,880
servers

329
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,360
and can help you create packages publish

330
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,639
them and push them towards clients

331
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,839
so that was all for me thank you

332
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,160
and if you want to download the tool

333
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,800
it's available on github

334
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,120
if you have any questions or

335
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,279
grab me afterwards or if you have a pull

336
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,560
request please submit them to my github

337
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,040
thank you very much
