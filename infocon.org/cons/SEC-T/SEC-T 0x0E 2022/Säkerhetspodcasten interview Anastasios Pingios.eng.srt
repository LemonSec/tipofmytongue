1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,359
so hi this is the secretary interview

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,280
stream uh we're almost uh to the end of

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,980
this conference uh we uh we have um

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,900
anastasios hey nice here with us today

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,359
and you were talking about uh nation

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,580
states nation state which is always

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,279
interesting yeah and uh especially since

8
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:27,779
we have so many

9
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,640
representatives from different agencies

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,439
yeah here at the conference we're at the

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,059
Swedish Capital so we have a lot of you

12
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,480
uh weird guys and girls talk about the

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,219
like encryption Appliance and so on you

14
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:39,480
have some of those sponsoring the

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,100
conferences sure yeah probably they will

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,440
not be that happy no no no but it is

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,780
like a lot a lot of things happened

18
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,760
after snowden's leak of course then we

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,620
sort of got like the public got a really

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,399
good Insight in how shady and corrupt

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,360
internet has uh involved in that like I

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,280
would say there are a lot of employees

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,059
that

24
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,340
are retiring now when they are going out

25
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,899
and they are speaking about the let's

26
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,459
see not everything that they did but if

27
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,080
you have the context then you can put

28
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,760
the piece together you can easily see

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,299
where they are going so uh yeah like 10

30
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:13,439
years ago those employees would be

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,520
active inside so they could not talk

32
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,260
about but now they are retiring and you

33
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,700
get a lot of more insights into what's

34
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,580
happening yeah and what another thing I

35
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,520
was uh really impressed about was that

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,979
this is this is just your your pet

37
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,840
project this is this has nothing to do

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,900
with what what you do for a living is is

39
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,180
but but it's been quite a few years that

40
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,240
you've spent researching this so uh yeah

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,520
like as I mentioned my it was

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,140
interesting like I started from the

43
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,540
offensive side of security and uh

44
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,920
quickly I realized like some of the

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,240
things I was doing and they were ending

46
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,040
up in the hearts of those people yeah it

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,780
didn't take real quick science to figure

48
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,360
it out then I I learned some of the

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,340
people I was working with they are

50
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,960
moving to that direction so I had to

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,520
make this decision and I moved to the

52
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,439
blue team side so I have seen some of

53
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,240
that but I was never in an intelligence

54
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,060
agency I never had a clearance so uh

55
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,399
yeah this is all pure research and I

56
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:06,719
really enjoyed that and then I also

57
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,860
started looking at the Historical

58
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,660
Espionage part in this when I started

59
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,640
seeing the correlations that foreign

60
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,540
companies and acquire companies to touch

61
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,060
the customers for digits yeah no we've

62
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,860
seen a lot of that and I the one thing

63
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,680
that sprung to my mind when I watched to

64
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,520
talk now was uh uh the the alleged super

65
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,819
micro do you remember that one yeah but

66
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,739
what's that even that was not ever

67
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:40,260
confirmed right no one found anything

68
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,239
yeah I don't like that because I have

69
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,860
spent a lot of time and also as a

70
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,180
professional because at that point I

71
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,980
know that you are the right guy to ask

72
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,959
about this I was still doing

73
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,480
infrastructure at budging and at that

74
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,980
point we were assessing some super micro

75
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,780
servers I can't say if we use them or

76
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,160
not but we're assessing them and of

77
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,720
course we're like oh this is true that's

78
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,400
a big thing so I had also a lot of

79
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,900
interactions directly with the vendor

80
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,700
and I also talked with a lot of people

81
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,080
like another companies big companies

82
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,879
that they were looking to that no one

83
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,620
was able to find that no even like a

84
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,200
companies that have amazing Hardware

85
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,659
reverse engineers nothing and I actually

86
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,180
knew one of those researchers that they

87
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,180
x-rayed the actual chipset and they

88
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,940
could not they they could maybe they

89
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,300
couldn't say it but I for when we had

90
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,300
the discussions they told me that we

91
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,040
have not found any traces of this yeah

92
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,560
and also the images that uh that were in

93
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,360
the article I don't remember it was a

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,680
specific module of the server I remember

95
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,480
which module that the only way to get

96
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,099
something useful it was like a two or

97
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,959
three specific Sports everything else

98
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,580
was it right yeah there was a lot of

99
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,440
flaws but I think it was only like a

100
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,900
thing a a lot of people think that was

101
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,420
like a stock thing

102
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,860
I was gonna say because we were

103
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,200
discussing this on on uh the security

104
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,980
podcast we have and uh we we all were

105
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,379
fairly convinced that this was some some

106
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,860
someone uh shorting the stock yeah and

107
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,260
and making money and and when we're

108
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,640
talking about implants and stuff my

109
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,239
opinion of this is that it like the

110
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,299
supply

111
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:13,980
like the the device like a firewall for

112
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,380
example the longevity of that one the

113
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,720
end like the cycle is long so if you

114
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,120
come up with a firewall that has to live

115
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,419
for 10 years

116
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:25,380
you're right it has to be there

117
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,060
otherwise it will not be a return of

118
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,979
investment and we'll go then you don't

119
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,259
want to spend money recursively putting

120
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,600
more money into that black hole hence

121
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,500
you will have old PHP old Java uh Libs

122
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,600
and whatnot and that will be a pretty

123
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,479
easy if you have the source code you

124
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,400
will be able to to create an exploit

125
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,440
yeah and also like if that will happen I

126
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,780
guess the most advanced uh Hardware

127
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,880
implants that we have seen it wasn't

128
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,919
like that like a there was a catalog

129
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,600
that I think it was licked by the AFF

130
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,120
that is the NSA art catalog Advanced

131
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,639
Network tool or something yeah that has

132
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,860
all sorts of Hardware implants and then

133
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,780
you could see for instance it is like an

134
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,940
entire BMC module that you replace the

135
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,199
other one you put this one and now you

136
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,080
have a doctor or it is uh like an RJ45

137
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,180
so okay that in there it has like a

138
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,919
beacon that you can catch it remotely

139
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,259
with a RF scanner and read through that

140
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,540
but yeah nothing like that even like

141
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,280
from NSA that's probably one of the most

142
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,900
advanced if not the most advanced in

143
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,100
that space

144
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,100
yeah yeah so yeah and then you have like

145
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,580
the rule of uh like the point of no

146
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,520
elasticity my English is bad like uh

147
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,639
which way to the Target will be the

148
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,100
least least resistance right a gun is

149
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,800
always a gun right so so it's like and

150
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,860
it's developing a software implant for

151
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,360
one of these network devices that it's

152
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,039
expensive so you don't want to get

153
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,720
caught because that would be crazy as

154
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,960
well but but we know like you you said

155
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,699
you research history like we've been

156
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,600
bugging cables deep down in the scene

157
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,280
it's happening but actually the person

158
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,100
that uh licks the poison ivy operation

159
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,240
I'm not sure if you have already yeah

160
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,539
yeah yeah the CIA employee that elected

161
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,780
the kgp back then died like last week I

162
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,400
don't remember it was like a 90 years or

163
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,280
so so it was an Insider that told the

164
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,660
teacher hey look at this table there's

165
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,340
something going on over there and they

166
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,020
actually the device that they had it's

167
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,520
still in the museum in Moscow so you can

168
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,039
go and visit them

169
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,680
they sort of put it outside the cables

170
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,120
yeah and it was cutting the emissions

171
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,280
and it was amplifying them and then

172
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,900
transmitting them yeah and that's this

173
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,800
is a long time ago yeah yeah so and yeah

174
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,560
and uh yeah yeah hardcore that's really

175
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,479
good it's really interesting too too if

176
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,940
an interesting case this year uh in uh I

177
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,440
don't remember I think was Denmark that

178
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,020
they caught like a research vessel from

179
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,940
Russia sure that uh oh it was our way

180
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,080
sorry that cut off a cable

181
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,979
in this place like what is kind of cable

182
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,960
it's like a full sinking station over

183
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,400
there that's capturing like all sorts of

184
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,240
uh signals no like uh

185
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,500
this is not yeah this is not classified

186
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,680
yeah we have uh like we have a submarine

187
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,259
microphones all over the entire uh

188
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,720
Baltic Sea oh yeah and that is not by

189
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,759
chance that's because there is a lot of

190
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,720
traffic and we have I I do I dive a lot

191
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,819
and I like wrecks so we have a really

192
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,720
nice uh there was like uh one uh Russian

193
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,120
fishing troller that sunk that got

194
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,759
raided by two diverse is a famous story

195
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,580
and let's say it was not a troller like

196
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,380
they found a lot of nice things in them

197
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,639
they're really good like the Russians

198
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,259
have an entire fleet of submaries for

199
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,599
that purpose yeah pretty deep into them

200
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,940
yeah oh it's really weird yeah it was

201
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,380
really interesting to hear your talk and

202
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,139
I think it's a it's a it is like living

203
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,240
in a James Bond movie it's pretty cool

204
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,039
yeah this is also what I mentioned about

205
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,560
the spine is that I'm thinking that what

206
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,360
do we see right like probably the

207
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,180
tiniest person sure sure I know for fact

208
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,039
for instance again based on the links

209
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,360
that we have that there were times let's

210
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,539
say x agency was running a hundred

211
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,460
operations in that country yeah and we

212
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,740
don't see anything in the news no no no

213
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,599
but that takes tax net for example now

214
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,240
that we sort of uh uh we sort of

215
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,419
unpacked that one how many hours of work

216
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,060
you got into creating that and that is

217
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,520
only one operation that we know of and

218
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,000
and and also I mean you know the the

219
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,160
different disciplines yeah yeah yeah

220
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,080
it's operation you had you know the

221
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,819
science and when you do like there is a

222
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:31,139
lot of books when when you do like that

223
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:34,020
if you don't focus on the Cyber side and

224
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,000
just look at how many car accidents

225
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,179
would scientists evolve to that like you

226
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,039
can learn interesting like uh I

227
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,539
mentioned crypto EG the shoes company

228
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,339
that was acquired by the CIA yeah yeah

229
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,680
yeah so uh only three people knew about

230
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,380
this in the company and the the son of a

231
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,120
board scheduling that uh he was to take

232
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
the company he really hated this

233
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,500
agreement so he traveled to the US in 50

234
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,200
or 60 to to cut these things like I

235
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,459
don't know I no longer want to do that

236
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:02,180
and he died in a car accident yeah

237
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,459
well no there was a lot of like yes yeah

238
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,980
it's really weird yeah yeah it's a bit

239
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,380
funny it's funny I mean it's pretty bad

240
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,000
to be honest but it's like it's pretty

241
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,760
interesting to see uh when it sort of

242
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,899
gets public about a leaked how

243
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:19,500
um

244
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,720
how we don't really care like we we look

245
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,399
at it we are amazed and then it's sort

246
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,740
of yeah all the time like last month in

247
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,959
Germany there was an FSB officer that

248
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,640
fell from the window yeah then we had

249
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,080
the other one in Italy that fell from

250
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,300
the balcony office in Manchester like

251
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,160
yeah things like that especially in

252
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,680
Russia there is a very interesting

253
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,959
interview there is a Defector that went

254
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,640
to the US from the FSB very recently I

255
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,680
think 2018 or so and said that they have

256
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,540
this kind of fun written a lot of the if

257
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,040
you decide to defect

258
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,140
you know you are in a glist if you know

259
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,420
like yeah we have all these Novo shock

260
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,080
things in in UK as well right and and of

261
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,420
course those those become very public

262
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,839
but but I mean the accidents uh that

263
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,240
happened they hardly make the news

264
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,459
but but when they they use like nerve

265
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,380
gas and stuff that you know that's

266
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,860
that's probably a last resort I think or

267
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,360
they want to send a message yeah and it

268
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,860
was a lot of collateral

269
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,899
like it wasn't a perfume bottle I think

270
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,760
yeah yeah and then they dropped it in

271
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,040
some parts

272
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,580
and used it and died

273
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,100
yeah right and she died and uh yeah this

274
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,480
is how they start the investigation yeah

275
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,820
yeah and that's like it's been

276
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,800
interesting this one is a bellycut

277
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,839
series on a naval visit poisoning yeah

278
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,640
they managed the social engineer the

279
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,459
actual FSB operators because they got a

280
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:42,899
like a lot of information of who is

281
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,279
their boss and managers and they call

282
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,040
them and pretended to be them

283
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,060
that's pretty cool yeah they have like a

284
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,279
YouTube discussion of with them directly

285
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,959
yeah yeah I think I saw about this yeah

286
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,880
yeah yeah that's really cool you have to

287
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,380
think all of the contagious you said we

288
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,339
didn't know that it's going to learn

289
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,200
that quickly with Germany

290
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,420
it's pretty interesting and he actually

291
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,240
survived no he survived twice right yeah

292
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,620
yeah but it's pretty interesting to

293
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,120
survived because for whatever reason

294
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,100
it's like you're super lucky they landed

295
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,140
very quickly Germany and again for I

296
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,579
don't know what reason they sent him to

297
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:13,920
a military hospital that they already

298
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,220
had like a biological chemical warfare

299
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,860
and understanding and knowledge oh this

300
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,140
looks like a poison here yeah

301
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,440
