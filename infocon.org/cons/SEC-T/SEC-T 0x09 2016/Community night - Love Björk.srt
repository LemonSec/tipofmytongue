this spring

32
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,000
so if you have a company and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> code</font>

35
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:44,880
hit me up afterwards<font color="#E5E5E5"> so my talk is about</font>

36
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,399
best practice and the inconsistency of

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,490
doing it the right way to understand

38
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:54,450
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i'll show you an example so</font>

39
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:56,759
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we have and imaginary business</font>

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone starts a business and as all</font>

41
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,360
other businesses<font color="#E5E5E5"> this business needs</font>

email<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it also needs a web server we</font>

the above<font color="#CCCCCC"> following best practices</font>

47
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,200
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll need to understand what</font>

48
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:21,390
that is

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:23,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">wikipedia SS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a best practice is a method</font>

or technique that has been generally

51
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,840
accepted as superior to any alternatives

52
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,910
because it produces results<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,620
superior<font color="#E5E5E5"> to those achieved by other</font>

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,030
hard can this be

59
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:50,700
well let's look at this network will

60
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,500
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a DM said since we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to have</font>

61
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,480
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> web server</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and since we have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> team</font>

62
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,460
said we might as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> place our emails</font>

63
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,989
there since an attacker might get access

64
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,520
to it somehow

65
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:03,570
now with this in itself isn't a problem

66
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,280
to the long axis is only given<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the</font>

00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:09,150
connection is established permanent site

<font color="#E5E5E5">this is when a client</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> contacts to grab</font>

70
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,570
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that there will be enough</font>

71
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough employees working</font>

72
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,100
there that the company wants our<font color="#E5E5E5"> old</font>

75
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,010

76
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,830
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in the local area network but</font>

77
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,380

however this connection is not

established from the inside but from the

00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:57,239
DM said<font color="#E5E5E5"> and therefore the packet gets</font>

what else could we do

97
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:28,080
well we could move the email servers

from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DM said but that is again</font>

again<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reasonable thing would of</font>

solution seems best but we never really

110
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:06,360
got around the real problem you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> best</font>

it should be the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's generally</font>

because no one uses it anyway because

all of the standards of best practice

122
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:40,440
this well you know how programmers have

<font color="#E5E5E5">some companies would argue that they</font>

135
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,430
one mistake<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then map</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will screw you</font>

136
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,050
over so bad

137
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:13,050
so let's let security line good

138
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:17,909
algorithms<font color="#E5E5E5"> being up-to-date not using</font>

139
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:21,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">char one or god forbid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> md5 the objective</font>

140
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:25,620
is of course not to give out all your

141
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:27,870
configuration and network<font color="#E5E5E5"> scheme but</font>

142
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,849
rather have a discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of why you</font>

143
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,190
chose one configuration over another and

144
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:33,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">why you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> built something one way and not</font>

145
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,909
the other

146
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:38,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's in some way to take back best</font>

147
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:41,820
practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> to something that will actually</font>

148
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:43,949
be helpful to have somewhere to talk

149
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,300
about problems that you run into<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

150
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:49,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll give you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another example of this</font>

151
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:52,500
this is part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a network that we built</font>

152
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,610
just before summer<font color="#CCCCCC"> see how it got quite</font>

153
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,759
complicated

154
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,949
well the company wanted extremely low

155
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:02,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we basically put into of</font>

156
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:04,169
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> but let's focus on this</font>

157
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:07,949
strange part of the network which is

158
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:09,779
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> RDM said this consists of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

159
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:14,339
edge router is connected to<font color="#CCCCCC"> two late</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

160
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:16,259
switches<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do servers and this is</font>

161
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:19,649
set up this way because we wanted to use

162
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:22,199
a protocol called<font color="#CCCCCC"> vrp app</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> road called</font>

163
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:25,409
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> two devices to share one IP address</font>

164
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:28,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">if one of them would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure the other</font>

165
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:30,209
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> would take over the problem with</font>

166
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,289
this is that this protocol only runs

167
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:36,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later too</font>

168
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:37,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore the network looks like this of</font>

169
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:40,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">course we could have used another</font>

170
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,899
standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> like GBP which runs through</font>

171
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:44,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">later three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but then the two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> servers</font>

172
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:45,990
have to be at the same subnet and since

173
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:48,479
we want them connected to different

174
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:52,500
routers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that wasn't an option</font>

175
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,870
this in itself might not breach best

176
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:58,020
practice even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i highly doubt it</font>

177
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:59,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't in some way but this is an</font>

that you will never ever have the best
