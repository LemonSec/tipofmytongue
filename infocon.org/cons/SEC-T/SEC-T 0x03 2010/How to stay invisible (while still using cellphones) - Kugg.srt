00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:34,870
and uh... i don't want to know this is
the info stiffness

172
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:39,419
to goto so this is an editorial is
hosting the hull

173
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,899
and this is an issue scrutiny as the
respect of your

174
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:44,899
business line

175
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,870
alternative

176
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,630
against blacks

177
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,860
so here's the guy in the country and at
this hearing

178
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,730
and uh... instantaneously these

179
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:00,790
left on his compared to the result

180
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,909
but actually traveling so that's
phenomenal

181
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,920
uh... fell into my first page

182
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,309
bath for for the month of senate

183
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:12,260
advertising why it was a little dazed
and

184
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,010
is being called for its decision i've
ever seen in this message here is the

185
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,470
receipt because it's just

186
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:22,250
associate on his responsibility of the
message

187
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,880
ahead in this city has been overtones
ccc metaphysically

188
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,689
uh...

189
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,940
thought they had he conveniently section
approximate always good to see his call

190
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,000
the safe

191
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,550
as you see anything

192
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,800
and this way in my position

193
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,520
and try to get

194
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,130
and there is more ways than one position

195
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,760
annual return information about it

196
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,210
either recently given this year it was
it was a war in sweden

197
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,330
remnants of helicopters at andrew's
littlest

198
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:01,370
events and i said temporary gotomeeting
online

199
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,820
and they were trying to follow

200
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,910
they also missile installations

201
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,219
outstrip minor

202
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,940
nasa buffs

203
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,930
something it wasn't for her friends is
that it's a historical data base of the

204
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,508
position of the woods

205
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:18,070
extraordinary falls the where

206
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:23,629
and uh... issues the issue that
institution response to you

207
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:26,260
and there is them

208
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,370
excuse me for a different political

209
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:33,560
for disassociation risks is ethically
racial discrimination used to prove

210
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,399
sensitive people singles the city

211
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,920
and inheritance taxes there's already
been scrutinized time decision

212
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,969
and forget it

213
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,670
disfigured by senator feingold

214
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,240
and uh... probable

215
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,430
criminals them

216
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,859
inconvenience

217
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,850
we'll see if admits that

218
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,480
best-case but it looks like it

219
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,870
uh... insolvency

220
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,870
quite powerful technique

221
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,870
so

222
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,080
this is something

223
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,890
you yourself

224
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:15,819
doctors you know by thirty feet enrolled
and also only fundamentally different

225
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,650
novelty

226
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,009
this is the most awesome thing

227
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:23,310
so army is saving lives or isn't there

228
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,410
for

229
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,730
for redundancy easier b c administered

230
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,490
at the end of this error

231
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:35,960
london and was lawful insight into the
southeast missouri state university

232
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,139
usually is

233
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:40,400
such as the president is gone

234
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,079
before there's there was no difference
retired which was to be beholden to

235
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,420
three feet high

236
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,860
really doesn't grow and still and
messages

237
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,540
and uh... so they think they do the same
thing

238
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,579
and seeking liberalization

239
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,680
almost all of your style

240
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,469
all our forces will be announced the
receipt

241
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,520
but i don't get this behind us coop
thinking oh shit

242
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,800
signal

243
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,060
there is a leading to disease because
it's a very education

244
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,609
no

245
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:16,910
i think would be wrong

246
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,310
economic marshall

247
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,780

253
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,680

equally worn morning seasonal network

00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,130
an israeli issue

256
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,199
and don't lose the lesson

257
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:51,099
and reduces sheet

an in another

262
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:03,949
and again

263
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,780
further explain why there is a law
students

264
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:14,069
and begins stick to

265
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,950
them

266
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,220
and i was informed as you see

267
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,240
with the first part of themselves
competed to jennifer

268
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:29,240
and by managing all the speech elsewhere
actually had people dead

269
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,950
and shitty buddy of mine in cuba and in
fact quite hostile and when he was janet

270
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,520
someone c

271
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,470
or do anything with it

272
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,239
uh...

273
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:41,950
by the city and an eighth

274
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,180
days u_s_ people and also insists that
it is

275
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,239
animals and the reason is the unions

276
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,570
believes this is the case

277
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,300
prudential

278
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,589
all unisys com

279
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,190
so

280
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,130
insinuates

281
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,850
so some people

282
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,830
kindergarten recently had some person
who is a

283
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,760
she she may sink or swim times these
decisions are being made stays the same

284
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,390
indian disney's related

285
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,040
initially started

286
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,139
and and and managed to disinfect dashiki
humane

287
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:30,139
israel as possible especially when
you're free speech entitles us to do

288
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,739
during his family's tracker there is
anyone free software talking

289
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:38,740
you're and

290
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,230
it's usually been yourself for a
president worth his before and you

291
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,020
should change do you remember

292
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,490
and for virtually free

293
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,639
because she made over two hundred use
number

294
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,500
other suspect questioned the legality
different countries

295
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,360
and i don't know if this is sexy denise

296
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,700
realistic

297
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,560
and this lady switching cigarettes

298
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,780
administratively simple solutions over
because it is virtually the same thing

299
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,829
is flying in from

300
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,320
so

301
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,160
if your store

302
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,520
prison guards has shown is excellent

303
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,220
dash in south dakota himself

304
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,060
and ready for his part as a single from
for next week

305
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,310
so they're receiving the call scam

306
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,760
all the sim card

307
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,260
which should be thrown off from operator
sites operators of the photos can go

308
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,020
wrong

309
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,730
enables clients

310
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:44,510
added destabilized score frequency cases
will signal displeased too trendy follow

311
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,189
let me ask you seriously aristide

312
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,000
he's obviously

313
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,220
anything for you to see what happens

314
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,500
and did you have practice humans
involved here

315
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,510
you can tell you haha abroad

316
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,470
itself

317
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:03,150
and trying to figure out a worse holders
across florida who are so much

318
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,319
uh...

319
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,580
and when you do this

320
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,549
it's

321
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,300
this interesting

322
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,300
there is a

323
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,089
within a by three thousand nine said

324
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,089
in so far as for our

325
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:17,120
entered the authentication is physician

326
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,350
sponsor is something that i would like
to

327
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:25,099
there are various actually in the
context of our audience's incor

328
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:27,280
until you make the request

329
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,500
and uh... indeed you next time

330
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,040
and it can be easily

331
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,250
so so we can associate

332
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,130
takes monarch

333
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,840
that once you know that you can tell

334
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,720
physical

335
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,170
so this is the crux

336
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,630
of the core of this week's home

337
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,130
uh... it gives me

338
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,000
incorrectly

339
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,790
you right through my work

340
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:59,420
on and we thought this is what it is
likely to be tried

341
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,459
uh... again

342
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,680
uh... and he writes that involved with
her car which is a six people are better

343
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,760
if you hear is part of the former home
to watch football

344
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,730
politicians

345
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,630
it used to have these cards

346
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,640
they say it's a total ownership or
something

347
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,260
don't do it how it all in all this hard
work

348
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,650
and is on the car is actually at home

349
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,699
genesis

350
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:28,170
dishonored and as a whole passionately

351
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:32,250
and even writing and and rightly so
thick it's part of it

352
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,090
anything

353
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,980
on unit cohesion sets

354
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,440
edited anyway he wants

355
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,980
uh...

356
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,600
ke others of the release of these yeah
and that's

357
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,850
asking operator committee

358
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:52,859
and uh... and is there is also a lawful
process suggest you look at carol's

359
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:56,889
and it's really solid insurers
controversy companies

360
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,510
also be able to do you see first

361
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:06,379
tvc foremost instantly state such a test
case let's just has to be another time

362
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,260
along that's true

363
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:14,480
except israel

364
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,470
insult

365
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:22,020
angeles-based parts despite you didn't
see any progress in europe such as she

366
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,360
did not work

367
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,490
and germany there is still available to
solicit networking structure saddam

368
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:33,490
entities that are less people on a
previous are and and and and there is an

369
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:36,210
issue that

370
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:40,070
is easier to track for the most families

371
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,020
reversal

372
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:47,440
and uh... incidence lawsuits almost
impossible to get a simpler

373
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,550
wilsonian you sometimes worked for you

374
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,230
unity

375
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,620
and ask the question is this possible

376
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,830
i've heard is that you were cancelled

377
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:01,070
i've always thought referrals austell

378
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,129
katzenberg

379
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:11,130
and then it this way i think it wanted
to sit with us

380
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:17,659
italy's passport

381
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:19,700
so

382
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,050
cases before the end of the year

383
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,139
these burns

384
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,850
policies to reach is over

385
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,709
makes

386
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,350
appalled

387
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,149
and that makes them instead

388
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,390
interim

389
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,420
interest part

390
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,150
phone is actually fashion phone for you

391
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:44,950
president wilson is it possible to slash
fuhrman bosnian process almost four

392
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,990
months ago

393
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,130
mental status briefing is the that

394
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,220
and andrew address that was a

395
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,820
fervently perhaps

396
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,350
blackberries for mostly

397
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,899
because backers

398
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,710
approximately in the email account i
wasn't going through the mid nineties

399
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,660
and he didn't like that because the
usage

400
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,860
via emails

401
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,269
so many others

402
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:09,120
anybody actions thoughts trashed

403
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,389
instead on

404
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:14,459
three months of course to which must be
ridiculous incidents

405
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:21,230
through an oddity

406
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:24,480
obviate battles of rock

407
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,920
interesting and apparently disgraceful

408
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,560
and i mean there is a racist or is that
it happens sometimes often on

409
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,240
another is that

410
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,970
cedars-sinai rose responsible for speech

411
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:41,450
offense fine people instinct to people's
views and stuff

412
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,600
and there is a

413
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,990
critics all of us has lost much of the
religion left

414
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,570
difference between spiteful

415
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,710
uh... provided by much

416

lutheran standoff

421
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,730
unity with so many phone calls going
into it

422
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,370
and we're going to

423
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:12,510
you he was going on because those people
who here if you plan on and personally

424
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,990
in telling his supporters on or off

425
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,120
execution of the love

426
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,518
for positive free speech

427
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,570
willful at stake

in tn

430
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,110
so that's not sure about that

431
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,659
to lead the reason the intercession for
science

432
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:41,070
is only for a for a meal on tracking and
these different sizes and shapes focus

433
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,820
on the front row seat in the fight and
fight

uh... not that there is something
fullerton bandits

437
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,399
been happening and sometimes

438
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:04,639
and that's how and what it mentioned
there was a also talk about bosses sins

439
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,770
uh...

440
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,599

accept

447
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:26,980
but for some inconsistencies and will be
a good reason to use triggers the e-mail

448
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,850
turned this into tenderness catering to
see them

451
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,929
insulting the emerson process and it is
because it is in everyones

452
