there's always

657
00:37:54,089 --> 00:37:57,909
sense for us

658
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,829

667
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:30,999
and uh...

668
00:38:30,999 --> 00:38:37,999

stuff

673
00:39:05,749 --> 00:39:11,279
this is a good fit because it is
believed to be free on bail

674
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:13,589
first decides

675

multi-disciplinary

680
00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:01,069
so autocracy

681
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:02,909
still hundreds possibly

682
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:07,469
each thank you

683
00:40:07,469 --> 00:40:10,009
