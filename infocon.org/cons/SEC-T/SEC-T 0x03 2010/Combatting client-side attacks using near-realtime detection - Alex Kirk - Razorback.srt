00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:05,889
leader

24
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:12,759
but today in the process

25
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:19,099
pop up

28
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:38,879
great deal more difficult to be

29
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:43,229
where he was really is

30
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:49,659

it's difficult pickups

160
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:47,240
i guess for today

161
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,719
