00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,920
hello everyone

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,000
today meeting is a tlp wife and i want

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,880
to remember you that the q i session

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,039
will be at the end of the meeting

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,359
and one microphone is on the right side

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,960
one is on the left

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,080
and

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,320
the session name is it's just a jump to

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,199
the left of boom and

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,840
let me help with our welcome to lindsey

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,680
kate and scott small from recorded

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,830
future

14
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:44,399
[Applause]

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,200
all right hi everybody thank you so much

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,800
for coming to our talk today it's just a

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,640
jump to the left boom prioritizing

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,920
detection implementation with

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,840
intelligence and attack

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,600
so i'm lindsey k senior director of

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,680
operational outcomes record future so i

22
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,960
run the technical arm of our threat

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,320
intelligence team and i'm a malware

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,719
analyst and reverse engineer

25
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,720
and i'm scott small i recently

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,479
transitioned to a new role as a senior

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,560
analyst at a major u.s retailer but

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,320
prior to that i was a consultant

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,400
supporting mostly enterprise level

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,640
clients on both strategic and technical

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,880
applications of intelligence and to kind

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,640
of summarize our talk i'm happy to

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,799
report that mitre attack remains alive

34
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,439
and well in the cyber threat intel space

35
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,600
in even just a few years as a consultant

36
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,840
i saw a pretty steadily growing interest

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,000
in using attack for cyber threat

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,479
intelligence applications but also to

39
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,880
inform intelligence driven adversary

40
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,240
emulation and purple teaming

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,000
real quick standard disclaimer here the

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,600
content that i'll cover today doesn't

43
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,280
necessarily reflect the views of my

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,880
employer

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,360
and let's get into it so i'm a little

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,840
biased but in my view mitre attack

47
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,000
remains the best lens for generating

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
intelligence around and analyzing

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
adversary behaviors or tactics

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,840
techniques and procedures

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,079
however as interest in mitre attack has

52
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,880
continued to grow so too has the size of

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,880
the knowledge base itself so there are

54
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,680
now nearly 600 discrete techniques and

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,399
sub techniques in the enterprise matrix

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,760
and countless more implementations

57
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,360
and we'll circle back to this point

58
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,920
later but i recently took a survey of

59
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
publicly available detection rule

60
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,959
repositories and i found more than 9 000

61
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,879
of these detection rules and these are

62
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,319
just the open source ones there's plenty

63
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,040
more in private commercial repositories

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,400
as well as over 2100 offensive security

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,920
test scripts

66
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,160
so based on this alone the need for

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,319
prioritizing which controls to focus on

68
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,959
strengthening is clear and i've even

69
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,640
seen more awareness that intelligence

70
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,239
ideally should inform that

71
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,000
prioritization

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,239
what we'll do today is give more detail

73
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,319
about how this looks in theory we'll

74
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,000
walk through a case study showing

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,400
practical applications of miter attack

76
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,680
for cti

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,599
and finally we'll give a quick look at

78
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,599
an open source tool i had the chance to

79
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,760
release this spring that's designed to

80
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,560
help speed up this intelligence informed

81
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,000
control strengthening process

82
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,680
but first some quick context on why

83
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,760
we're framing up this whole discussion

84
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,599
around intelligence as opposed to

85
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,440
something like detection engineering or

86
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,319
threat hunting ultimately i really see

87
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,239
intelligence teams as being central to a

88
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,480
strong security program they really

89
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,959
serve as an important bridge in three

90
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,519
key ways

91
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,440
number one

92
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,920
intelligence teams bridge between the

93
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
external and internal

94
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,000
most intelligence teams maintain good

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,519
awareness of the external threat

96
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,159
landscape yes but also the internal

97
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,400
operating environment what technology

98
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,120
and processes are in place right now and

99
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,879
what transformations might be taking

100
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,120
place

101
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
number two intelligence teams bridge

102
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,360
understanding of both the strategic and

103
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,920
tactical levels of the threat space

104
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,760
what adversaries are most likely to

105
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,319
impact my specific organization and how

106
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,080
are they most likely to go about doing

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,000
that this area is really where minor

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,319
attack is most impactful

109
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,840
and then finally number three a little

110
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,239
bit of a combination of the other two

111
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,000
intelligence teams are perfectly

112
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,478
situated to bridge between the offensive

113
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,120
and defensive disciplines of security

114
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,600
by knowing what ttps are most likely to

115
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,360
impact the organization and what

116
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,080
technology is at risk but what controls

117
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,479
can mitigate those threats intelligence

118
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,000
teams have unique and valuable

119
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,240
perspective that can and should inform

120
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,840
control validation and strengthening

121
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,520
so before i hand it to lindsay i want to

122
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,080
cover key sources that i recommend for

123
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,240
surfacing intelligence around adversary

124
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,479
behaviors including in some cases

125
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,000
information that's already mapped to

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,280
moderate attack

127
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,960
these include three types of sources

128
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,960
that you might already be using open

129
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,560
closed and technical sources

130
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,639
closed sources will include your own

131
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,720
internal telemetry sure but this can

132
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,800
also include cases like when initial

133
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,199
access brokers have gained a foothold

134
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,199
into organizations and are reselling

135
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,440
that access on the dark web or cases

136
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,120
like lindsay will cover where actors are

137
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,280
sharing new tools and ttps on

138
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,360
underground forums

139
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,120
next most of you are probably familiar

140
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,800
with government agency and vendor

141
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,880
reporting which increasingly aligns with

142
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,639
mitre attack but one of the less

143
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,680
commonly used sources of open source ttp

144
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,320
intelligence is actually social media

145
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,840
there are many cases where security

146
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,000
researchers are publishing content that

147
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,240
either contain direct references to

148
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,320
techniques or even in some cases

149
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,720
explicit mentions of attack t code

150
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,479
identifiers themselves and you can

151
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,240
search these platforms for that type of

152
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,759
content

153
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,759
and finally some of you may be utilizing

154
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,919
technical sources that automatically map

155
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,000
to miter attack things like malware

156
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,320
sandboxes or network security controls

157
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,639
a really important note here is that

158
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,560
certain of these intelligence sources

159
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,720
will inherently be looking at threats

160
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,240
that have already been observed in the

161
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,600
wild whereas other ones really kind of

162
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,120
enable us to start strengthening

163
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,520
controls in a more proactive manner

164
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,440
so it's going to be a perfect segue into

165
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,120
lindsey's content where she's going to

166
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,360
cover her team's process for surfacing

167
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
and creating detections around these

168
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,800
truly emerging and novel threats

169
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,720
awesome thank you scott

170
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,479
so one of the things i hear a lot about

171
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,759
from clients is that they're really

172
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,759
concerned about ransomware but one of

173
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,960
the things i want to underscore is that

174
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,800
by the time the ransomware is dropped

175
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,479
detecting it is often a little bit too

176
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,800
late so let's go over what the anatomy

177
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,479
of a ransomware attack is and some of

178
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,800
those initial stages so first initial

179
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,880
access really just kind of how a threat

180
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,720
actor gains initial access to a target

181
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,919
organization

182
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,680
then after they gain access what they'll

183
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,919
want to do is find other systems to move

184
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,919
to potentially find other data of

185
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,120
interest

186
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,960
escalate their privileges or establish a

187
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,440
persistence mechanism in case they lose

188
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,280
access to that organization

189
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,960
then many ransomware threat actors

190
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,479
though not all of them will often

191
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,479
exfiltrate data so they can further

192
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,840
extort the victims into paying the

193
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,000
ransom and then only then is the

194
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,840
ransomware actually dropped

195
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,520
so you can see a bunch of different

196
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,680
tools that are used in this kind of the

197
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,520
stages right before the ransomware is

198
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
dropped to give you some idea so not

199
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,440
every one of these tools and ttps is

200
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,680
used in every ransomware attack but you

201
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,440
can see a bunch of different examples of

202
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,599
these types of tools

203
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,120
but what i really want to underscore is

204
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,240
that if we're trying to detect the

205
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,520
ransomware attack before the

206
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,440
ransomware's dropped there's a lot of

207
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,440
opportunity for detections especially at

208
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,080
this second stage

209
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,400
so insert group has a tools and ttps

210
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,840
team that looks for these emerging

211
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,360
threats and new tools that scott

212
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,440
mentioned that are released on open and

213
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,759
closed sources technical sources dark

214
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,199
web as well

215
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,479
but one of the things that we want to

216
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,879
ensure that we do as the technical team

217
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,400
is make sure that the intelligence that

218
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,879
we're putting out is something that our

219
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,960
clients can definitely understand so

220
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,720
maybe not everybody understands all the

221
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,360
specific nuances of you know different

222
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,599
types of malicious tools but being able

223
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,280
to use attack really provides that

224
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,520
lingua franca to allow the technical

225
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,360
team to convey what these tools do how

226
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,039
they work and then

227
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,960
allow our clients to make decisions on

228
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,240
whether or not they want to implement

229
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,759
these detections

230
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,840
so we'll produce two different types of

231
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,879
products

232
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,280
to convey this intelligence so first a

233
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,080
ttp note so this effectively functions

234
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,039
as a lead so here's the tool that we saw

235
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,879
it was published then by this threat

236
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,039
actor approximately this is what it does

237
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,039
providing a high level overview so be

238
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,719
aware of this not necessarily something

239
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,440
we've seen used in the wild just yet

240
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,399
we also have insect validated ttps so

241
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,080
these are often reserved for these very

242
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,000
high potential tools or things that we

243
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,320
started to see used in the wild so

244
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,080
different samples are released and what

245
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,680
we do is we provide

246
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,600
all that context but we also provide

247
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,360
actionable intelligence in the form of a

248
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
yara sigma or snort rule that clients

249
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,720
can take and then implement their own

250
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,120
environment if they choose to

251
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
importantly both of these things are

252
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,800
mapped to attack to really allow clients

253
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,640
to quickly understand what this does and

254
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,839
then is this something they're concerned

255
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,279
about so let's look at a specific

256
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,440
success story that the team had over the

257
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,640
last year

258
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,519
so in august 2021 we saw a threat actor

259
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,839
release a steeler called jester steeler

260
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,399
on the dark web and we put out a note

261
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,519
in case you're not super familiar with

262
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,519
steelers what these are are they

263
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,519
effectively take victim credentials and

264
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,240
they'll

265
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,320
exfiltrate them to the threat actor so

266
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,080
they can use these to continue to

267
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,680
escalate their attack or potentially

268
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,120
even sell some of these credentials on

269
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,240
the dark web to other fed actors

270
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,200
then in january 2022 we actually saw a

271
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,600
user on social media share a sample of

272
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,000
this steeler on malware bazaar so now

273
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,600
it's suggested to us that this was being

274
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,279
used in the wild and this is suddenly

275
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,600
kind of escalated in importance to our

276
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,920
clients so what we did

277
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,399
was we put together an insect validated

278
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,120
ttp and a signal so now our clients not

279
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,560
only have an understanding of what this

280
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,560
malware is but they also have a way to

281
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,000
detect it in their own environment if

282
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,200
they choose to

283
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,120
so you can see the

284
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,800
signal rule here and then you can see

285
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,399
some of the attack t codes that were

286
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,360
relevant to it so this allows customers

287
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,800
to quickly understand like what does

288
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,640
this rule look for is this something

289
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,160
that i'm interested in and should i

290
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,600
implement this as part of my defensive

291
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,040
strategy

292
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,720
so with that i'm going to hand it back

293
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,079
over to scott

294
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,839
oh sorry um

295
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,279
so it was actually really validating

296
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,519
then to see this about a month later so

297
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,880
another vendor actually identified

298
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,680
jester steeler as a priority threat so

299
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,360
this was awesome because it definitely

300
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,040
validated that our process is working

301
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,959
and also told us that we were able to

302
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,320
give our clients a way to detect the um

303
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,640
the malware about a month ahead so our

304
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,600
clients were able to have this rule and

305
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,200
then suddenly jester steeler was being

306
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,360
recognized externally as another type of

307
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,880
priority threat

308
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,640
now hand over scott

309
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,480
cool thank you

310
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,519
okay so

311
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,760
in the real world where i most often

312
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,920
started to see organizations utilizing

313
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,519
intelligence and miter attack

314
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,600
specifically to inform control

315
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,640
validation was as part of a threat or

316
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640
risk profiling process

317
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,480
so i've gone ahead and highlighted just

318
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,880
a few of the key most common components

319
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,279
that ideally should inform a good threat

320
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,360
model or risk profile i'm not going to

321
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,040
talk through all these in detail

322
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,800
whatsoever but i'll just start to kind

323
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,640
of highlight a couple so

324
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,240
in working again mostly with

325
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,079
intelligence teams we're seeing more of

326
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,240
this awareness that intel should be

327
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,320
feeding actual control validation and

328
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,480
strengthening and we're seeing

329
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,320
organizations doing a pretty good job of

330
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,160
understanding again those external

331
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
threats and getting a better handle on

332
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,640
which ones maybe were prioritized which

333
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,640
ones are targeting their industry as a

334
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,320
whole or maybe even their most immediate

335
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,079
industry peers

336
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,920
in working with the intelligence team

337
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,000
specifically where we often start to see

338
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,920
organizations struggle is to actually

339
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,839
take that next step and start to

340
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,399
understand what is our own internal kind

341
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,320
of control environment look like and

342
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,160
there are certainly frameworks like the

343
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,079
detect framework that exists that allow

344
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,639
organizations to you know more uh

345
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,480
structurally map kind of those

346
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,200
detections what we started to do as

347
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,360
support for intelligence teams was we

348
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,959
wanted to kind of hand more of that

349
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,959
information directly to

350
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,639
our client organizations and this

351
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,160
ultimately kind of i won't talk through

352
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
the full process that led to this

353
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,240
massive spreadsheet lots of ones and

354
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,079
zeros in it just trying to kind of map

355
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,639
out the publicly available security

356
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,480
tools and how they map to the attack

357
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,639
framework what this all ultimately kind

358
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,040
of culminated in i was able to

359
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,200
kind of open source this this spring

360
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,120
this is a very much kind of a live and

361
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,959
active project you can go check it out

362
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,560
right now but i'm very actively working

363
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,160
on some kind of enhancements through the

364
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,519
rest of the year and i've added some new

365
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,040
things which i'll have a chance to cover

366
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,320
here today

367
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,800
basically a web app that allows you to

368
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,279
search based primarily on mitre attack t

369
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,360
codes what are the relevant control

370
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,440
mappings to those as well as which kind

371
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
of threat vectors might exist

372
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,200
so this is known as the control

373
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
validation compass i'm really excited

374
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,120
about this because this directly derived

375
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,800
from work that we're doing out there in

376
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,320
the field supporting our clients and

377
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,240
just able to share this back out with

378
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,360
the community

379
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,760
but what is it specifically it's open

380
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
source tool pointing cyber security

381
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,959
teams to over 9 000 publicly accessible

382
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,240
technical as well as policy controls and

383
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,480
those over two uh 2100 offensive

384
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,360
security test scripts all aligned with

385
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,079
the over 500 minor attack techniques and

386
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,360
sub techniques

387
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,800
uh so again this is live you can go

388
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,320
check it out right now i've just got

389
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,000
some screenshots to make it a little bit

390
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,200
bit easier i'm going to just walk

391
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,639
through some of the key features i hope

392
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,560
you'll go check it out

393
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,560
after our talk today so this is kind of

394
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,399
the landing page just to kind of get you

395
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,680
started there's some advanced features

396
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,600
that i'll highlight here as well but

397
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,279
what kind of just getting your feet wet

398
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,639
getting started with this what this

399
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,560
looks like is just go ahead and plug in

400
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,600
a search for a miter attack t code or

401
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,240
its plain text name and you will

402
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,160
immediately return

403
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,040
these mappings to all of these security

404
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,720
technologies again the ones that are

405
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,240
openly sharing you know what their kind

406
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,320
of mappings look like and so we've got a

407
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,519
lot of the proprietary security tools in

408
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,040
here as well as these kind of

409
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,720
third-party like libraries or

410
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,320
repositories so i think the one that

411
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,160
most folks might be familiar with is the

412
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,199
sm sigma rules repository um there's

413
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,360
things like miter attack produces the

414
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
cyber analytics repository as well a

415
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,040
little bit broader more generic kind of

416
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,639
signature format

417
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,920
and then the things that i get really

418
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,240
excited about which is the open sourcing

419
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,639
of kind of the the red teaming content

420
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,800
those scripts that allow you to go

421
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,880
simulate or in some cases kind of chain

422
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,519
together and actually emulate adversary

423
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,199
behavior as it's been observed out in

424
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,040
the wild a lot of this has actually

425
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,040
increasingly becoming openly available

426
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,279
as well and we've got these mappings

427
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,199
available in the tool right now so this

428
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,399
is what it looked like when i first

429
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,839
released this in march i've already

430
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,360
added some improvements based on

431
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,839
community feedback just again with the

432
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,519
idea being trying to make this much

433
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,120
easier for folks in the field to

434
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,600
actually operationalize what i've added

435
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,760
now is you can click into some of those

436
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,440
links and i know it's it's really small

437
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,360
on the the page here but

438
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,600
what this is pointing you back to are

439
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,079
links back to the actual repositories

440
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,040
themselves directly to for example the

441
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,720
detection rules so you can go

442
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,800
automatically search for a t code and

443
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,360
then find within the splunk security

444
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,000
content repository or the elastic search

445
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,320
repository which detection rules they

446
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,519
have available that map specifically to

447
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,839
miter attack techniques a really good

448
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,199
quick and easy way of kind of drilling

449
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,959
down into the specific content that you

450
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,959
might be able to utilize

451
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,480
one really exciting thing about this as

452
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,399
well is i know obviously lots of

453
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,920
organizations most likely aren't going

454
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,440
to be using you know multiple of those

455
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,920
tools at once both splunk and elastic uh

456
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,600
there's increasingly opportunities to

457
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,440
kind of convert rules into various

458
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,680
languages so you can that's the entire

459
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,519
purpose of the sigma repository it's

460
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,000
it's a kind of a genericized language

461
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,519
that would allow you to translate it

462
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,000
into uh uh

463
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,639
eql spl uh what have you so you can kind

464
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,120
of convert these do these conversions uh

465
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,240
back and forth amongst different

466
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,320
languages it just gives you more

467
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,079
potential content as you're going about

468
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:10,959
doing

469
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,160
research into detections

470
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,160
really what i see is the most exciting

471
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,920
kind of opportunity potential for this

472
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,240
tool is kind of this what i call the

473
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,560
threat alignment tab this allows you to

474
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,759
start plugging in some of those

475
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,839
components that would be specifically

476
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,399
relevant to your operating environment

477
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,480
so you have all sorts of toggle options

478
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,560
on the left under controls here where

479
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,639
you can specifically choose which of

480
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,720
those security tools exists within your

481
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,639
technology stack right now so you can

482
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,240
pinpoint exactly which tools you're

483
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,160
using if you're using any of those

484
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,000
third-party libraries as well you can go

485
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,320
ahead and toggle those on or off

486
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,839
if you're not doing any sort of kind of

487
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,279
iterative offensive security testing

488
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,720
right now you can just deselect all

489
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,399
those and just focus on the detection

490
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,199
side

491
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,800
for the moment but especially for those

492
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,639
most mature teams that are performing

493
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,639
you know pretty rapid control feedback

494
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,800
processes you can go in and say i'm

495
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,359
using the atomic red team framework or

496
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,280
i'm using prelude operator

497
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,599
as as kind of my c2 framework all of

498
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,640
this stuff being publicly available and

499
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,160
ideally you can come in here with this

500
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,319
being open source if you've got your own

501
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,640
internally developed content as well

502
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,160
it should be pretty easy to kind of line

503
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,520
everything up and you can start adding

504
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,760
in your own data as well the final piece

505
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,520
of this that i find most exciting is on

506
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,880
the right hand side the threat

507
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,400
intelligence window

508
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,039
this allows you to drop in

509
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,960
basically threat intelligence and start

510
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,039
to kind of line that directly up with

511
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,640
those controls that you might have in

512
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,240
place within your own environment what

513
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,880
that looks like in practice is it uses a

514
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,600
json you just simply copy and paste the

515
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,840
json into the tool itself

516
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,000
what this is kind of derived from is the

517
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,320
miter attack navigator this is a

518
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,240
visualization tool that they've released

519
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,919
and allows you to create these nice heat

520
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,679
maps and kind of visualize which

521
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,880
techniques

522
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,799
are being used by adversaries or

523
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,520
specific malware if you download the

524
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,000
json from a navigator that map that

525
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,520
you've created yourself you copy and

526
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,600
paste it in here you click that purple

527
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,520
button at the bottom and you immediately

528
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,000
get outputted with the entire list of

529
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,160
the detection rules and the offensive

530
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,799
security tests as they specifically line

531
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,960
up with kind of this profile that you've

532
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,280
built for your own organization

533
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,880
and just by the way no data is

534
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,240
transferred with this either it just

535
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,000
performs a quick lookup all within the

536
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
tool itself i know lots of organizations

537
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,360
are sensitive about you know they'll

538
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,280
create their own heat maps maybe based

539
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,440
on internal data so nothing is being

540
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,039
kind of transferred or stored anywhere

541
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,559
within this too which is kind of that

542
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,080
was very intentional building it that

543
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,240
way

544
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,160
so just talking through a very quick

545
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,679
kind of case study with applying

546
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,520
something like the control validation

547
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,000
compass to kind of uh these very real

548
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,360
active threats that we've been talking

549
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,200
about here today so what you're seeing

550
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,120
here is a screenshot of that malware

551
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,600
bazaar repository result that lindsey

552
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,840
had mentioned for jester steeler itself

553
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,960
this is just showing you a quick

554
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,799
screenshot you can go look up this hash

555
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,320
and malware bazaar and land on the exact

556
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
same page that i have what you can do

557
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,919
with that if you click into some of

558
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,360
these tabs is you can see the specific

559
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,039
miter attack techniques and sub

560
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,760
techniques observed and associated with

561
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,400
this specific sample of jester steeler

562
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,760
and i've got those highlighted this is

563
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,679
directly a screenshot from that miter

564
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,880
attack navigator visualization tool

565
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,039
what you can also do with this though uh

566
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,799
is keeping in mind you know again all

567
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,559
this open source information so this is

568
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,840
coming from one of those technical

569
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,280
sources when i talked through the the

570
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,360
various source buckets earlier we can

571
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,039
also pull in a lot of this information

572
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,200
from just purely openly available

573
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,360
sources as well so now what you're

574
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,120
seeing again i know it's pretty small

575
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,039
here but you're seeing kind of a

576
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,840
combined miter attack heat map for a

577
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,760
total of eight different steel or

578
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,240
malware the entire purpose of creating a

579
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,000
visual like this is to start to see

580
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,520
where there's clustering or

581
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,000
concentrations of certain miter attack

582
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,200
techniques and that's what you're seeing

583
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,720
visualize with like the brightest red

584
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,840
colors that's where we're seeing the

585
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,720
most overlap the way that i created this

586
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,480
i have these all saved on my own

587
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,400
personal github if you want to go grab

588
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,080
those yourself but i pulled this

589
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,080
directly from the miter attack database

590
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,400
itself you can directly within the

591
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,240
attack navigator tool or just from the

592
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,120
website itself you can kind of load up

593
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,280
all of the techniques in this heat map

594
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,520
view associate associated with certain

595
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,360
types of malware for example so i just

596
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,360
did a quick search for steeler there's

597
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,640
probably a lot more refinement that you

598
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,080
can do around this but i mean this took

599
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,520
a total of like five minutes to put

600
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,400
something like this together so compiled

601
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
all of those they had seven in mitre's

602
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,120
database overlaid the gesture steeler

603
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,799
example as well and that's what gave us

604
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,200
this kind of final heat map

605
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,880
just to highlight again kind of our

606
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,640
constant emphasis on you know

607
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,280
multivariate sourcing some of the types

608
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,880
of sources that were feeding into the

609
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,240
data that you're seeing on the screen

610
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,360
right now

611
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,600
were reports from the u.s csa

612
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,000
organization as well as security vendor

613
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,200
reporting

614
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,880
again just emphasizing that it's not

615
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,640
theory what i was talking through you

616
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,919
truly can pull in attack map data from a

617
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,240
wide disparity of sources

618
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,919
the final step with all this this is

619
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,360
what we used to kind of walk through a

620
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,679
lot of clients getting up to this point

621
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,440
and that is you know a great visual to

622
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,880
be able to show off leadership show

623
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,480
where there's concentrations and

624
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,919
techniques where you may want to focus

625
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,520
in a little bit further what do you

626
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,679
actually do with that data

627
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,679
what i did in this case is i just

628
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,240
downloaded the combined json for the

629
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,159
heat map and i threw it into that little

630
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,640
window on the control validation compass

631
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,559
this is now directly

632
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,000
populating

633
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,559
kind of concentrations and mappings of

634
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,440
the technical and policy controls as

635
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,520
well as offensive security tests that

636
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,760
you could run all directly in alignment

637
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,280
with these techniques and you actually

638
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,640
have a few different sorting options

639
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,240
with this as well the way that it

640
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,880
default outputs in this view is actually

641
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,480
from low to high

642
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,159
meaning it's going to highlight the

643
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,400
techniques that appeared in your threat

644
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,280
profile for which there are fewer kind

645
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,480
of out-of-the-box detections and tests

646
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,080
the takeaway what you can do with that

647
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,320
is ideally and i see this in practice

648
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,240
ideally teams will go and create their

649
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,440
own custom detections or tests to try to

650
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,760
emulate those and see what that looks

651
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,520
like in their own environment were they

652
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,080
able to detect it often cases you may

653
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,000
not be able to if there could be a good

654
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,679
reason why there's not an out of the box

655
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,440
detection for something like that it's

656
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,880
going to take a little bit more time and

657
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,720
effort to create something like that but

658
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,320
that's the entire reason you go through

659
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,000
this process because you're finding kind

660
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,559
of a higher priority technique based

661
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,720
upon your unique risk model

662
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,880
so i think that brings us to our end we

663
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,280
ended up wrapping quite fast so more

664
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,360
than enough time for lots of questions

665
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,980
here thank you so much for the time and

666
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:52,840
[Applause]

667
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
attention so thank you lindsay thank you

668
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,799
scott uh it's really interesting the

669
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,880
case study when intelligence drive

670
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,720
detection uh

671
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,440
detection rule that we were about i work

672
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,039
in intelligence as intelligence player

673
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,840
for us it's important to make reports

674
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,880
for treat hunting for a team and

675
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,120
at the end of this or their activity

676
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,640
it's important to

677
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,640
implement new detection rules cover the

678
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,799
uncovered part and so on

679
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,120
there is some question from the

680
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,439
sides

681
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,200
and the microphone is on the right side

682
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,360
so um really really interesting uh tool

683
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,120
thank you very much for releasing it and

684
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,640
and yeah

685
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,480
i'll look into that i have a question

686
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,799
about like detection so um one of the

687
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,640
things that we that we see is like with

688
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,120
a sock then afterwards working on the

689
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,640
detections

690
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
they sometimes get overloaded by the the

691
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,480
false positives right

692
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,760
so um

693
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,520
is there some way that you thought about

694
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,080
like also indicating which

695
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,840
detections you you highlight at the end

696
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,799
um

697
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,440
to give them sort of a precision value

698
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,600
sensitivity and precision basically yeah

699
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,919
so the statistical concepts that would

700
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,840
be really interesting yeah that's that's

701
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
a really great question and point and

702
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,440
thanks for the the feedback on the tool

703
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,880
too um so

704
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,559
man there's a lot to impact there uh i

705
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,640
would say like right now out of the box

706
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,480
i'm not familiar with anyone that is

707
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,960
really doing exactly that one thing just

708
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,960
for everyone's awareness the kind of

709
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,880
structure of a lot of these detections

710
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,960
are built with lots of opportunity and

711
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,360
like fields for metadata so if you

712
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,440
yourself were able to you know pinpoint

713
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,039
that based on if you run some tests in

714
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,799
your environment you can certainly plug

715
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,640
that in and the takeaway with that is

716
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,240
you know over time you build a larger

717
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,760
library and you can start to kind of

718
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,279
sort and filter based on your own

719
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,400
results i'm not aware actually i

720
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,640
i do think uh for a few of these

721
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,960
repositories they do highlight you know

722
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,279
potential for false positives but it's

723
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,039
definitely not super common and that's

724
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,640
why i didn't kind of include any like

725
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,320
fields like that in what i had because

726
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,400
this is probably just like one or two um

727
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,080
i'm also aware of like a few commercial

728
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,640
vendors that are their entire purpose is

729
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,320
to kind of uh create uh these very uh

730
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,960
high level simulations so they can start

731
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,120
to see like they're lining up the atomic

732
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,679
red team with the sigma rules and almost

733
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,520
like consistently running them against

734
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,520
each other to see what the output is

735
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,320
there as well so um

736
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,799
yeah it's a it's a tough one um not

737
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,559
seeing a ton like right now at this

738
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,159
moment but i know lots of organizations

739
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,279
are definitely like aware of that the

740
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,000
false positive challenge is very real um

741
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,840
i personally think that it is something

742
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,520
that organizations do kind of have to

743
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,000
deal with i don't personally like to see

744
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
people just excluding a rule if it's

745
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,520
generating a lot of false positives

746
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,320
because

747
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,840
there's probably a good reason for that

748
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,200
and you can hopefully do a little bit of

749
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,279
tuning to bring that down yeah so so

750
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,520
maybe like uh if it's possible to to

751
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,880
have like a feedback cycle from sock

752
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,080
saying yes uh that rule hit

753
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,480
it was you know sensitive enough to to

754
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,039
get the the the actual attack

755
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,360
but the precision was very low so

756
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,919
therefore it got too much other stuff

757
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,279
you know something like that it would be

758
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,360
really a recommendation for the further

759
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,240
100 that is the way to go ideally yes

760
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,039
and and in reality uh you know typically

761
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,559
it's kind of the more mature programs

762
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,400
that are doing this but i personally

763
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,880
believe and have seen once you start

764
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880
getting into this it does become easier

765
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,080
over time in reality kind of the the

766
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,919
real scenario is you're going to be

767
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,799
performing potentially multiple retests

768
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,480
of those techniques that you had already

769
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,360
tested it's it's almost uncommon where

770
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,960
the first time you put in one of these

771
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,960
detections it's just works perfectly

772
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,720
from there that's the nature of how

773
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,039
challenging it is but oftentimes if you

774
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,760
do one two maybe three retests you can

775
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,840
bring that false positive rate down and

776
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,679
i do think like tracking all that is

777
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,440
absolutely the way to go yeah that's

778
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,400
great

779
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,559
finally comments too to just bring this

780
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,960
to a cycle to you know the the model

781
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,360
here is uh solving it basically together

782
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,200
right do you see it do you see like a

783
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,840
chance that this feedback cycle

784
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,799
uh for sensitivity and precision uh

785
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,880
could be shared amongst teams here is

786
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,960
that common enough or that in your

787
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,840
experience

788
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,679
the log detection is so different that

789
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,520
it's hard to compare

790
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,880
i wish it could get to be that point but

791
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,960
in the in the short term i don't i'd

792
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,720
love to hear your feedback i i don't

793
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,000
think in the short term it's going to be

794
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,480
possible i see too much variance in

795
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,559
organizations just internal telemetry

796
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,399
data sources all of that dude were you

797
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,039
agreeing with that or

798
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,559
yeah

799
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,279
you're going to tell us

800
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,840
sorry well it's it's kind of now my job

801
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,799
too

802
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,039
in in the new role but yeah

803
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,960
it's uh i would love to see that happen

804
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,080
i'm sure

805
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,000
folks will introduce frameworks for it

806
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,159
and that would be very welcome but it's

807
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,360
end of the day

808
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,360
gonna be almost organization specific

809
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,240
did you have any more equipment

810
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,279
okay question from my friend marco hi

811
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,159
thanks uh thanks for the talk um

812
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,880
definitely check the tool out uh just

813
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,120
simple question you wanted to ask if you

814
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,240
offer apis and you're gonna offer those

815
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,880
in the future so to allow basically good

816
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,440
integration with local tool chains and

817
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,399
so on

818
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,320
oh was that for the the tool that we

819
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,320
talked about at the end um so i would

820
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,200
say all of the information is available

821
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,120
in one format or another within like the

822
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,760
underlying the github repository for it

823
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,640
there's json data that has like just the

824
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,399
counts of the mappings

825
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,880
all of those when you get down to these

826
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,840
specific detection rules and the links

827
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,640
it's not in a very easily ingested

828
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,320
format right now there's very good

829
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,960
feedback that i'll take back this exists

830
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,480
in markdown right now so it's all there

831
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,240
and available and it is parsable because

832
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,279
that's how it's generated it's not in uh

833
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,080
json down to this level i've considered

834
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,640
maybe like sticks as well but

835
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,720
that would be appreciated yes because i

836
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,360
mean in the end we're gonna have

837
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,240
different environments so i i work for

838
