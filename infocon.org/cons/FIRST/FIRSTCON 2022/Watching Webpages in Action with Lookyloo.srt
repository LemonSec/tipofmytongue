00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,840
things can happen to defenseless little

pockets

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,439
she started studying uh hackers in 1995

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,080
after a wasted use of usenet and bbsing

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,040
her writing uh tends toward science and

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,640
technology and her projects tend toward

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,320
uh towards um

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,119
supporting a journalist and activist she

29
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,200
has covered a sci-tech copyright law

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,159
robotics and a body a

31
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,320
body modification

32
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,200

culture and medicine but no matter how

34
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,960
many times she tries to leave she always

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,960
come back to hackers

36
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,520
okay so much for queen

37
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,479
and

38
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,720
now rafael

39
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,520
rafael vino

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,000
is a security researcher at the computer

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,719
incident response center luxembourg

42
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,759
circle

43
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,040
you know it

44
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,920
since 2012 raphael wants to increase the

45
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,439
i.t consciousness of the human beings

46
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,280
populating the

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,400
internet in order to make it safer for

48
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,080
everyone that's important his day job is

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,520
a mixture of forensic and maori analysis

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,560
with a lot of python on top of it

51
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,599
to glue all the pieces together

52
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,959
he loves sharing and thinks everyone

53
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,120
should contribute to open source

54
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,239
projects

55
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,440
okay

56
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,160
so uh

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,360
uh

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,040
so

59
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,760
the title of the talk is watching our

60
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,480
web pages in action with

61
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,080
luki lu

62
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,440
right okay so floyd's yours

63
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,120
thank you thank you

64
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,920
uh so uh this is rafael from circle and

65
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,120
i am quinn from the internet um

66
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,200
uh and uh but we're really here to

67
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,599
introduce you to lookie lou

68
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,959
a piece of software we've been

69
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,200
developing for some years now

70
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,159
so

71
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,879
we all know the web is a terrible place

72
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,599
but

73
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,560
how terrible is it really

74
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,319
uh so

75
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,200
we

76
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,360
we created a tool to figure that out to

77
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,959
look closely at what happens when web

78
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,599
pages load the term looky loo is kind of

79
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,920
an american vernacular term

80
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,720
used for either a person who walks into

81
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,480
a store looks at touches and picks up

82
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,319
everything but doesn't buy anything

83
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,879
or for the people who gawk at traffic

84
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,360
accidents while they slowly file by and

85
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,360
uh looking we'll show you both of those

86
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,159
aspects um uh of lookingly doing this

87
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,480
for the web

88
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,720
but let's start in a nice place on the

89
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,680
web

90
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,280
don't worry there's plenty of train

91
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,599
wrecks coming later

92
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,920
this is a nice clean website which is

93
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
also full of interesting content which

94
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,720
may interest you it's the eff or

95
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,080
electronic frontier foundation it's the

96
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,319
internet's first and original digital

97
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,400
rights organization

98
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,599
they have to be really well behaved in

99
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,319
terms of compliance privacy tracking and

100
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,159
so on since that's kind of their thing

101
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,120
um

102
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,880
we're all pretty sure this website isn't

103
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,079
doing anything too dodgy

104
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,720
so that's what happened when you open

105
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,600
eff.org in your browser and it's loading

106
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,960
a bunch of content and this is the

107
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,639
looky-loo view yes that's a look at the

108
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,759
view of the of the website um so what

109
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,360
happened when you open a page is like

110
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,880
you load the url and that url is going

111
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,199
to load some extra content

112
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,960
so from the left to the right here you

113
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,280
have content loaded by each of those of

114
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,840
those two apps

115
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,800
so yeah times move left to right and

116
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,639
there is no cookie set in that in this

117
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,639
capture

118
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,840
so

119
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,000
those inc i could show you the content

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,320
that we look at specifically when um

121
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,800
when we open websites and those ones are

122
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,120
like well-behaved node of the first page

123
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,919
of eff and you can see it loads uh six

124
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,960
javascripts uh three css files and 20

125
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,240
images

126
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,639
and those content like those before the

127
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,520
css are loading um a few more images on

128
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,440
web phones it's just pretty normal stuff

129
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,680
here

130
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,960
so what is lookie loo in general that

131
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,440
thing you just saw a little tiny snap of

132
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,919
well it's a forensic tool

133
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,560
it's for mainly for the investigation of

134
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,280
websites showing website contents but

135
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,919
also kind of capturing and just giving

136
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,000
you an interface to see websites in

137
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,199
motion

138
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,759
we're indexing all the headers resources

139
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,240
and everything that a center received

140
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,320
mapping that onto a tree the tree you

141
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,400
just saw and displaying what type of

142
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,600
data each element is along with links

143
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,440
there's links inside there

144
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,440
to the elements content

145
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,000
and hashes for that content this is this

146
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
will be important later

147
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,520
the more you use your particular

148
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,080
instance of lickiloo the more valuable

149
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,800
it will be

150
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,479
so look hello is not uh developer tools

151
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,880
of your browser it has some other lap

152
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,479
and you will have some of the resources

153
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,880
that you see in lukilu that are also in

154
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,440
in developer tools but it's really first

155
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,639
and foremost a forensic tool so it can

156
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,080
find things in a capture that are hard

157
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,840
to find anywhere else

158
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,680
as well as its context and we are

159
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,280
hashing and correlating all the

160
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,240
resources between websites

161
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,840
so we are capturing it away from your

162
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,880
browser meaning that the capture is down

163
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,560
in a dedicated browser this is not the

164
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,800
one that you use on a daily basis so you

165
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,720
don't end up like leaking any of your

166
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,000
own information or potentially being

167
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,840
compromised or anything like that

168
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,240
and it also gives you a way to configure

169
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,000
the browser you're going to use to do

170
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,840
that capture

171
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,479
and we are saving everything that we

172
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,319
like we capture during that let's you

173
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,400
get during that capture so it can be

174
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,120
studied studied and analyzed later on

175
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,360
and another really interesting thing is

176
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,520
that it gives you a blurry version of

177
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,039
the screenshot you can also unblur it

178
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,800
obviously but that blurry version of the

179
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,639
screenshot of the page can be really

180
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,880
useful useful

181
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,880
when you realize that you really wished

182
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,720
you didn't see it so that's really

183
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,240
important like basically you have a way

184
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,160
to not not see every screenshot that you

185
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
capture on that indicator that was a

186
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,759
pretty early feature request and we

187
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,199
suddenly realized it was a very good

188
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,080
idea

189
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,960
um

190
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,720
so why did we build wikiloo

191
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,000
like most good stories it starts with a

192
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,919
room full of lawyers

193
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,639
so back in 2015 we were brought in by

194
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,560
some friends to have kind of an

195
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,960
educational informational session with a

196
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,479
bunch of media and journalism lawyers in

197
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,080
new york and um we were kind of there to

198
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,960
scold them about serving malvertising uh

199
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,319
and they were kind of there to find out

200
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,720
how to not serve malvertising

201
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,560
that was one it was not the only focus

202
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,080
but it was definitely one of the things

203
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,520
that we were all talking about that day

204
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,720
so

205
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,960
my field i'm a journalist normally my

206
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,039
field has a lot of problems these these

207
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,120
days our traditional business practices

208
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,879
have evaporated and everyone's just

209
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,680
scrambling to survive which means that

210
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,639
journalism is a big old target for

211
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,039
both above board and below board

212
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,360
exploitation

213
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,479
um

214
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,719
and

215
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,479
these law these

216
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,160
media and journalism lawyers were really

217
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,759
worried about being hacked and being

218
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,280
taken advantage of

219
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,039
because it was happening

220
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,719
a lot

221
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,719
um in this time range especially i

222
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,000
suspect it's still happening i just

223
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,279
don't think it makes the news that much

224
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,880
also because we're um we're little we're

225
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,640
a little nattering sewing circle we just

226
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,320
love reporting on each other getting

227
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,240
hacked and then reporting back when the

228
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,080
other one got hacked

229
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,360
so

230
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,040
i guess that got i don't know that the

231
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,160
advertising getting away but the

232
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,440
reporting got less fun over time

233
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,880
so uh

234
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,640
when when they said these lawyers and uh

235
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,320
and essentially the people they were

236
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,000
working with kept saying to us

237
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,360
how do we know what's on our site

238
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,279
and we looked at each other in a room

239
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,880
full of people like this and we looked

240
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,440
at each other and we said we realized we

241
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,560
didn't have a tool to give them and um

242
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,480
we looked back at the lawyers and said

243
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,959
we'll get back to you now initially our

244
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,519
thought was okay there'll be something

245
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,200
out there and we can send it to people

246
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,480
and they can

247
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,959
integrate it into their um

248
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,320
into their infrastructure and their

249
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,440
processes

250
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,440
there is nothing there was nothing out

251
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,680
there that actually allowed people to

252
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,839
see their own websites or other websites

253
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,200
in motion

254
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,320
so

255
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,959
we built it

256
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,440
and let's go back to the eff example

257
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,120
again clean

258
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,279
simple and safe

259
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,040
and we're running this page through a

260
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,680
browser a headless browser we're mapping

261
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,360
all the connections to the content on a

262
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,440
phylogenic tree that's the format you're

263
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,000
looking at here which shows time left to

264
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,240
right and resources as they are accessed

265
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,079
and placed on the page

266
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,200
there's always a relationship we always

267
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,880
try to preserve that relationship

268
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,959
there's always a time flow and that's

269
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,720
what a phylogenetic tree specifically

270
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,800
gives you phylogenetic trees are used to

271
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,440
map evolution for life on earth

272
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,079
the web is complicated and terrible but

273
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,000
we're betting it's not more complicated

274
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,480
than seven several billion years of of

275
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,480
the evolution of life

276
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,720
we hope

277
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,839
uh the eff site we use it because it's

278
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,079
very simple but it's a real exception

279
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,720
most things are not like the fsf site

280
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
most large websites are are

281
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,760
agglomerations of cruft and crud and

282
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,240
content and code that's never very well

283
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,640
maintained um and never as maintained as

284
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,320
the website admins thought it was going

285
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,000
to be or at least hoped it was going to

286
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,440
be so

287
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,200
at the other end of the spectrum from

288
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,640
the eff is fox news which is an absolute

289
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,079
mess

290
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,079
and not the way you think i mean mess

291
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,560
oh no oh no

292
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,640
so that's how it looks like when you

293
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,160
open the the fox news website in lukiloo

294
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,240
so like it's not even out of the tree

295
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,160
you have on the on the image here like

296
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,839
it's just way bigger than that but we

297
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,000
couldn't just fit it like tiny lines you

298
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,200
could see nothing if we put the whole

299
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,440
tree up there so yeah like that and

300
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,800
that's the front page that's just like

301
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,000
you load the front page and that's what

302
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,399
happened uh you're getting from europe

303
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,440
12 months of content um just like by

304
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,519
waiting for long enough if you load it

305
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,240
from outside of europe like us it's

306
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,480
going to be way bigger than that we

307
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,399
guess it's somehow related to the fact

308
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,720
that try to do some gdpr compliance we

309
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,800
don't know but anyway it's just like it

310
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,399
can go really crazy

311
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,440
um

312
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,360
and it's it's content it's also crap

313
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,040
mostly crap and they're just not that's

314
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,000
not editorial it's a lot of ad networks

315
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,079
tracking widgets

316
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,200
all kind of

317
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,120
probably broken things that i mean i

318
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,560
haven't noticed yet

319
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,760
and like all those complex websites um

320
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
they are like badly managed software

321
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,959
project

322
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,200
full of craftsman camps it's just a lot

323
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,880
of things going on that

324
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,720
who knows what's what's happening

325
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,160
and before you think you're picking on

326
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,240
fox news for the fun of it this website

327
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
has the distinctions that's on the to be

328
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,560
the most uh constantly crushing

329
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
looky-loo basically it was just like too

330
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,560
big on just making all kinds of stuff so

331
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,880
we had to rewrite part of the code in

332
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,480
order to make it

333
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,440
just

334
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,320
support those kind of big websites so

335
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,160
it's just not the content it's also like

336
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,920
everything that is happening on that

337
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,560
specific page fox news is a great way to

338
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,160
test an application like this

339
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,040
so what is lookie lube good for um

340
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,480
here's a an overly busy slide on that

341
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,320
beyond oh damn

342
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,279
that page is a mess the web is a mess

343
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,120
let's actually kind of drill down and

344
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,040
look at some more security focused use

345
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,800
cases for lickeyloop

346
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,519
we can get past this busy slide um it'll

347
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,440
be somewhere online if you want it and

348
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,800
get to examples and explanations

349
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,519
so

350
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,560
here

351
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,959
here is trustwallet the most trusted and

352
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,480
secure cryptocurrency wallet

353
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
conveniently named trust wallet so that

354
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,880
you know it's trustworthy

355
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,760
of course

356
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,160
it is not trust wallet it is a fishing

357
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,240
wallet it's a fishing site intended for

358
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,560
a trust wallet customers

359
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,320
so this is how the phishing site is

360
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,000
loading and you get to see the

361
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,519
infrastructure and even the stuff

362
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,040
they're kind of using trickery most of

363
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,199
which is redirects at this point

364
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,760
to hide this is also where capturing

365
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,519
hashing and building the data page of

366
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,880
elements really comes into its own

367
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,959
so that's another example of fishing

368
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,519
websites here um so looks trust is a

369
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,320
two-factor logging system for luxembourg

370
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,240
government on banking

371
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,560
and again that's just like a fishing

372
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,279
page and as you can see here you end up

373
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,360
with a few redirects

374
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,680
and when we look

375
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,839
at css on this page

376
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,199
we see that

377
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,839
the same css like the same blob that is

378
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,240
used on the switching website

379
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,000
is also visible and it's also used on

380
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,160
other captures in that case we have that

381
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
css yeah i was just gonna say just to

382
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,440
make it a little bit more clear what's

383
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,959
happening here is we're kind of drilling

384
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,240
down we're essentially clicking through

385
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,440
the nodes on the page we're not

386
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,639
demonstrating that we're just putting it

387
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,800
in slides but so you know how we got to

388
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,880
this particular thing um we're going

389
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,440
from the node to the content to the to a

390
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
list of the things that was there yeah

391
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,680
and what happened here is that we have

392
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,600
like that css resource that is loaded on

393
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,360
that page and we can see that we have

394
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,000
that same css document

395
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,959
also loaded in other captures

396
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,160
and that's where it gets really

397
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,680
interesting to have

398
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,760
a lot of captures in your in your local

399
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,720
instances that you can find um like

400
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,040
similar phishing pages

401
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,720
that have been seen by other people in

402
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,399
your organization

403
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,399
so that's just like the reason we hash

404
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,880
all those resources and unstore them

405
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,639
locally on the instance of the look

406
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,519
hello instance it has the nice effect of

407
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,320
um

408
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,720
when you see something that isn't lux

409
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,639
that isn't lex trust you know that has a

410
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,279
css you know it's um

411
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,399
it's not supposed to be there

412
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,880
because looky loo captures everything in

413
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,959
time sequence and maps it out we catch

414
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,199
infrastructural bad actors that are

415
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,759
using techniques to obscure what they're

416
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,399
doing like this is a case of a targeted

417
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,560
phishing attack which very quickly

418
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,160
redirects to google when it detects that

419
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,759
it's not actually at the target it wants

420
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,519
to be at

421
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,639
so normally when that happens you lose

422
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,399
the middle layers like you know

423
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,759
something happened and now you're on

424
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,519
google

425
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,680
but but looky loo lets you actually

426
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,519
expose everything that happened before

427
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,639
the redirect to google

428
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,279
so lookieloo accidentally turns out to

429
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,240
be great for finding gdpr violations and

430
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,800
oh boy

431
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,920
so many

432
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,959
so it's there's no good news none

433
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,160
um for instance uh the mirror newspaper

434
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,000
in britain i know they're not

435
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,079
technically in the eu anymore but

436
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,240
they're still they haven't scrapped gdpr

437
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,079
yet and it was just the first thing we

438
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,199
found

439
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,360
this is all over believe me we founded

440
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,880
uh french

441
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,880
news websites were terrible

442
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,839
um

443
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,320
and uh so what we see here uh on the

444
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,079
mirror's website under looky loo and

445
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,600
again it's one of these huge ones so

446
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,519
we're just exciting a little bit of it

447
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,560
is uh before actually any consent can

448
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,120
even be given before you even click

449
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,320
agree add services from google and

450
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
doubleclick are in an iframe they're

451
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,399
setting and reading cookies

452
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,839
and there's more evidence down the line

453
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,839
of stats and tracking

454
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,279
ips

455
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,839
there's a lot going on in this tree

456
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,199
journalism companies are some of the

457
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,599
worst regular offenders we've found on

458
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,240
privacy tracking and gdpr and that's

459
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,160
because our only business model left is

460
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,119
selling you you to social media

461
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,799
companies who are slowly dismantling our

462
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,319
industry

463
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,559
anyway moving on

464
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,359
so uh let's go a bit into like how look

465
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,919
hill is built on what kind of tools um

466
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,000
are used so

467
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,760
in order to do the capture

468
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,840
we now use playwright which is an

469
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,960
amazing tool by developed by microsoft

470
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,080
that is mostly used to um just test

471
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,400
websites basically to just like make

472
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,320
sure that the website is responding

473
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,120
properly uh to to anything that is just

474
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,000
like just like contigration for websites

475
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,880
um

476
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,480
we just switched to playwright from

477
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,559
another tool that was called splash that

478
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,240
was not really maintained anymore but

479
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,480
playwright is basically a full

480
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,720
headless browser that you can configure

481
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,840
the way you want and it is great to just

482
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,400
to use in in lokido

483
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,559
the other tool we are using is called

484
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,120
ete toolkit which is a python library

485
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,480
developed by biologists to represent

486
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,200
phylogenetic trees

487
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
so that's again like a bunch of tools

488
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,679
that are linked together and as i said

489
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,440
like just you put glue between all those

490
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,039
tools and then you have something that

491
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,160
is usable

492
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,559
um so yeah that's what we did for for

493
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,600
like the back end and for the front end

494
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,919
we're using a d3.js which is a

495
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,840
javascript library that we use to like

496
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,600
actually represent the tree itself on

497
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,559
the page on flask which is a web

498
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,799
python web server with

499
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,960
jinja which is like the templating

500
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,440
system so just like all those tools like

501
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,760
jammed together with some glue and

502
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,720
then you have lukilu

503
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,440
okay let's talk take a look at some

504
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,039
specific features and the interface of

505
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,200
lookiloo when you start a capture on the

506
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,600
first page of lookieloo you have some

507
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,360
choices to make

508
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,440
including your browser user agent and

509
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,600
configuration of

510
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,960
your

511
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,480
capture

512
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,240
so browser configuration

513
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,640
obviously browser agent changes the

514
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,400
contents of websites

515
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,080
uh so we let you configure that

516
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,400
but there's one limitation here which is

517
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,720
that we can't change how our website

518
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,240
responds or how our web browser is

519
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,400
responding to website probing of browser

520
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,320
capabilities so if the site that you're

521
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,120
you're

522
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,080
uh

523
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,600
accessing is um is using probing more

524
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,000
than user agent you're that's that's

525
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,240
kind of gonna that's gonna show or not

526
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,360
show as

527
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,440
the case may be

528
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,120
uh so there are a few modules that will

529
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,760
make playwright harder to detect um like

530
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,840
play white styles and stuff like that i

531
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,000
didn't implement them yet but there is

532
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,840
something that we can do about that to

533
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,039
make it harder to detect right now it's

534
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,720
still seen as a headless browser so

535
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,600
some

536
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,200
some people trying on some websites

537
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,799
trying to like poke what figure out what

538
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,240
is browsing them

539
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,039
we'll

540
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,880
we'll just detect it and block you but

541
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,720
we are looking at implementing it

542
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,039
in the near future

543
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,000
uh configuring um the initial settings

544
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,520
of the browser we have

545
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,679
the standards http headers refers

546
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,600
cookies proxies

547
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,679
uh obviously geolocation will change

548
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,120
what kind of

549
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,000
mess you get from fox news um but also

550
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,080
cookies allow for you to do scans with

551
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,679
the logged in state which is pretty

552
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,400
vital for for a lot of applications

553
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,280
um

554
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,240
so yo dog i heard you like captures um

555
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,760
[Music]

556
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,280
now you can do more captures from your

557
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,760
captures in this case for instance like

558
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,520
if you've got a bunch of urls from there

559
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,120
you can click to kind of do further

560
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,000
captures on those urls in this case uh

561
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,559
it would be useful for say you've got

562
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,159
phishing that's been blocked by bitly

563
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,640
but you want to investigate that so you

564
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,360
have the url and you can re re-run that

565
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,520
and we keep the state in case you need

566
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,880
cookies and referrers etc

567
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,919
so look hilo as we said it's like a tool

568
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,000
you can install in-house

569
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,799
it's really useful to allow your users

570
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,280
to like notify you about

571
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,960
something that they want you to

572
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,039
investigate so

573
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,000
this is extra special yes so in that

574
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,159
case uh you can just basically click on

575
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,080
the on the web interface enter an email

576
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,159
address and some details and it's going

577
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,960
to submit a notification to

578
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,760
the

579
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,640
admin of the platform

580
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,200
you also have the ability to

581
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,840
connect third party tools so in the

582
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,600
public instance we have virustotal on

583
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,360
urlscan.io that are

584
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,880
automatically there so we can just like

585
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,600
look

586
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,159
at the results from those two

587
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,200
services

588
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,919
um if you install lukilu in in your own

589
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,679
organization on yourself you need to get

590
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,440
your own api keys um but sorry wikilea

591
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,640
doesn't come with virustotal yeah

592
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,320
but yeah it's just like an extra few

593
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,919
features that you can have that are

594
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,280
quite handy

595
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,960
um yeah

596
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,440
so let's go back on like when you when

597
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,400
you investigate specific nodes

598
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,280
when you click on a node you can it's

599
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,120
going to open a pop-up and that pop-up

600
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,600
has a lot of information about all the

601
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,480
requests that have been made um to load

602
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,320
the page

603
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,400
so when you have when one of the

604
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,200
resources downloaded is an image you can

605
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,039
hover over that the icon and you will

606
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,960
see the specific image

607
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,760
pretty handy you can download each

608
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,600
individual resources so if you want if

609
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,200
you have like a specific entry like a

610
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,159
css or some javascript or something that

611
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,039
turns out to be potentially malicious

612
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,799
you can just click on it download it and

613
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,799
investigate it manually so you don't

614
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,240
have to like

615
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,480
try to scramble to figure out where this

616
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,760
specific resource comes from you can

617
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,880
just download it it's fairly

618
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,200
straightforward

619
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,600
[Music]

620
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,840
in the other integrations uh we have

621
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,520
obviously a misp

622
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,480
integration so you can search

623
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,799
like from a from a capture on a miss

624
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,840
instance

625
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,039
um yeah yeah so and when you have hits

626
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,039
so any urls or ips or resources it's

627
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,600
going to be to show you uh like the

628
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,440
event in mist you can click on it and

629
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,919
open the mis the missed event and that's

630
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,000
just like a handy way so again on the

631
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,280
mis

632
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
integration requires you to have your

633
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,200
own miss instance like it's not you

634
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
cannot access that you can't use ours

635
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,360
yeah like you cannot access

636
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,919
like circle missed instance in that case

637
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,039
yeah

638
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,039
and you can

639
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,799
trigger so you can like

640
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,799
do a search request against mist but you

641
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,600
can also push a capture on a miss

642
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,360
instance so you can configure it and if

643
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,520
you are used to misp you see like the

644
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,559
info field and then the tags and so on

645
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,400
and when you click it's going to publish

646
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,880
to like submit the mis

647
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,640
event on honors instance

648
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,039
okay

649
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,279
we have an apa in case you're afraid of

650
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,520
your mouse and love looking at code

651
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,200
so you can basically do all those

652
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,520
actions like all the actions you you had

653
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,679
on on the web interface you can do it

654
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,679
over the api so just like the python

655
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,279
module but it's just like a simple rest

656
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,279
api you can just

657
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,880
use it as it is

658
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,400
and you can submit to misspen everything

659
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,840
like that

660
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,919
okay so we have this is fairly new we

661
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,679
have a wikiloo browser extension which

662
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,520
will allow you to submit the page that

663
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,760
you're on logged in or not to an

664
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,080
instance that you've configured

665
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,279
i hope that you can see the problem here

666
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,520
because please please never use this on

667
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,360
a public instance or an instance that

668
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,120
you don't control or

669
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,799
can completely expect what's going to

670
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,600
happen

671
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,400
your login cookie will thank you

672
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,320
your i your your credentials will thank

673
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,440
you for not putting this into the public

674
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,679
but it is it is convenient and powerful

675
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,440
if you have your own instance and your

676
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,000
own kind of more closed ecosystem so

677
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,159
yeah that's a close-up on the on the

678
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,840
browser plugin so you can see you can

679
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,679
like select what you want to send to the

680
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,480
capture uh so again like if you have if

681
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,320
you're like on facebook you're logged in

682
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,400
on facebook and you submit that to look

683
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,320
your instance it's going to also push

684
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,880
along all your cookie jars containing

685
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,440
your login cookies for facebook do not

686
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,799
configure that plugin on uh to connect

687
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,640
to a public nuclear instance very bad

688
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,840
using a cyber cafe

689
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,039
yeah so yeah just

690
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,679
be careful about that it is it lukitu

691
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,520
will let you shoot yourself in the foot

692
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,640
just

693
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,320
know that

694
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,120
i mean

695
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,240
it's harder to shoot yourself in your

696
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,360
foot if you don't use the browser

697
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,720
plug-in but we gave you the power

698
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,120
uh so what's next for lookie-loo uh we

699
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,720
are um

700
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,720
uh revamping the we've had some user

701
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,039
testing we're gonna be revamping the uh

702
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,520
ui uh i got sidetracked on that project

703
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,440
for roughly two years

704
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,000
anyway um

705
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,279
one of the other features that we are

706
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,320
going to add soon is a passive ssl

707
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,480
supporting passive ssl so basically we

708
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,039
will get like all the ssl certificates

709
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,919
and hashes and so on and throw them in a

710
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,000
passive ssl system that we have at

711
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,960
circle um just to again do look up

712
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,520
against that passive ssl instance and

713
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,880
submit new

714
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,559
new indicators

715
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,840
the other one that we are going to

716
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,240
implement soon is

717
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,480
like integrating it with pandora pandora

718
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
is another tool that we develop

719
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,120
that is used for analyzing specific

720
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,360
files and the idea will be to select a

721
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,440
file from the capture send to pandora

722
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,039
and then you will have

723
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,679
just details on like what what that

724
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,159
specific file is doing

725
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,679
okay and um

726
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,279
long more of a stretch goal at this

727
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,720
point but we want to create kind of a

728
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,960
modality to it a modes for different

729
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,559
investigative uses whether we're talking

730
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,240
about security which is most of the

731
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,320
focus right now people who are trying to

732
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
do research on the web people who are

733
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,240
trying to learn how the web works or

734
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,559
teach how the web works um and of course

735
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,880
the legal applications that were

736
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,919
somewhat the beginning of the genesis of

737
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,279
of lookie lou

738
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,039
but that's in the long term again i

739
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,679
still have to redo the ui

740
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,400
um so who is lookie lou for i mean

741
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,880
obviously security people you guys

742
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,279
uh but also i hope in the long run for

743
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,000
the lawyers who inspired it um

744
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
i think it could be a great tool for

745
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,200
journalists

746
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,720
uh who are looking at malfeasance and

747
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,640
bad things on the internet

748
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,279
website admins and we have had some some

749
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,720
feedback from people who are using this

750
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,240
on their own website to try and figure

751
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,360
out what the heck is happening um and

752
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,600
then ultimately educators and students i

753
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,960
think would be a great application for

754
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,200
this and already has been yeah yeah i've

755
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,520
been using it uh in a class in i was

756
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,919
giving uh last semester to just like

757
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,320
teach students how the web work and show

758
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,200
them that it's a lot more complicated

759
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,120
and messy than the message that they

760
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,880
thought initially and heck that we

761
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,640
thought initially yeah yeah i mean we

762
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,399
learned a lot by developing that tool

763
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,320
it's just yeah

764
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,039
and uh where do you get it yeah so we

765
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,360
have a public instance uh at circle so

766
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,200
look in the circle i'll tell you

767
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,840
you can just like use it submit your own

768
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,000
your own urls it has an api yeah it has

769
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,760
an api and everything

770
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,240
if you use this one know that the data

771
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,559
is all stated at circle so please do not

772
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,000
submit like

773
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,600
login cookies or anything like that that

774
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,200
would just be very annoying to like

775
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,360
clean up afterward

776
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,520
and it's open source obviously so it's

777
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,760
all accessible on github you have

778
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,600
installed guides on just explanations

779
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,880
and like what you can do with it and how

780
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,399
to configure it on only on github

781
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,440
yeah

782
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,760
and that's us uh so now we throw it over

783
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,600
to you guys for your questions yes

784
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,200
[Music]

785
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,440
thank you thank you very much for your

786
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,720
talk i

787
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,760
i found uh clicking a gdrp

788
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,480
uh

789
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,200
link uh consent to it means something

790
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,799
but now i know it's it's nothing okay uh

791
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,720
so question time uh

792
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,559
there are two standing mics

793
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,679
and

794
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,480
okay

795
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,960
go ahead

796
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,600
just a couple of questions one is on the

797
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
javascript engine are you

798
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,520
running a full javascript engine to

799
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,960
detect everything

800
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,679
to detect set timeout based

801
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,320
redirects or set timeout based

802
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,279
pull-in

803
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,760
what about things like service workers

804
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,600
and

805
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,679
cash where you can use cash to basically

806
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,960
proxy requests behind the scenes

807
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,760
and the session storages local storages

808
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,120
also where you can do

809
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,919
corruption of content yeah so it's going

810
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,600
to it's basically running in a full

811
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,760
browser like it's really using google

812
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,159
chrome headless like this complete

813
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,480
browser so it has access to all of that

814
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,960
um we are still like working on getting

815
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,080
the play right setting in line right now

816
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,000
it's it's going to it has cookies it has

817
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,240
local storage um

818
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,880
we allow a bunch of permissions to the

819
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,200
browser so it can do like a website can

820
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,720
do almost everything including like

821
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,480
geolocation and so on

822
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,039
we need to look more in how we can

823
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,039
handle timeouts

824
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,679
right now we have um like basically

825
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,520
levoit has really great support for that

826
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,880
you can like wait for a specific amount

827
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,960
of time before you close the capture um

828
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,520
we don't have at this point a way to

829
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,200
like make sure that all the timeouts are

830
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,279
over but it's possible with playwright

831
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,000
to implement something to basically make

832
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,919
sure that all the timeouts are still

833
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,760
have been have been triggered it's not

834
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,760
there yet but by default we wait

835
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,240
five seconds after the last network

836
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,399
interaction

837
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,720
so it will catch a lot of the cases it

838
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,240
should not necessarily catch all of them

839
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,480
but it's still possible to like bypass

840
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,000
uh look you know like figuring out like

841
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,799
just

842
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,200
not necessarily run everything but

843
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,679
for most of the use cases including like

844
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,519
malicious websites like phishing and so

845
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,120
on it it worked most of the time

846
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,640
and when that whenever use case that is

847
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,799
like not working properly we always try

848
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,480
to like implement it and fix and find a

849
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,799
solution for that so if you have like

850
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,480
times where it's like not working as you

851
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,440
expect it to work let us know yeah like

852
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,000
github open issue send us an email like

853
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,880
happy to implement uh walk around

854
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,880
yeah so specifically though with the

855
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,960
service workers where you can a lot of

856
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,880
the malware today uses

857
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,120
service worker to hide url request is

858
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,640
not even visible if you use the

859
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,080
developer tools

860
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,000
yeah have you looked at that yet or no

861
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,200
so

862
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,600
it's basically what we use uh from

863
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,960
playwright is ha output so the http

864
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,519
archive output so if it's in there we

865
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,159
will have it if it's not we won't

866
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,960
um but i should definitely look at like

867
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,159
i think it's going to be there i think

868
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,799
the hi has like a lot of that content uh

869
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,240
but yeah like we need to look at it like

870
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,279
we need to see if there is like stuff

871
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,600
that we are actually missing um

872
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,760
yeah

873
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,200
yeah please

874
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,799
i have i have two small questions one is

875
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:17,760
uh

876
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,519
is it working only with the website

877
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,720
which is live now or can i use it to

878
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,760
submit the whole web page when i we i

879
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,480
have for example i may need to analyze

880
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,360
the website which was uh which was

881
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,159
live on in the past but not alive now so

882
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,799
i can get it from a let's say wayback

883
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,120
machine or it i have the full package

884
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,039
can i submit it and get analyzes this

885
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,440
the first question the second one is

886
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,360
does it give me the

887
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,200
full overview what the website has or

888
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,080
does it also help me to understand some

889
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,360
malicious

890
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,240
uh

891
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,960
part particles it has for example if

892
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,880
there is a stored xss for example on the

893
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,159
website can i get this result from it or

894
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:02,880
i am

895
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,679
am i expected to get the

896
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,120
files and analyze by myself

897
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,039
so you will you're expected to analyze

898
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,360
it by yourself like you don't have like

899
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,360
we that's the kind of stuff we can add

900
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,960
and like we can probably figure out like

901
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,480
if there is a way to detect that there

902
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,640
isn't stored xss

903
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,320
i mean obviously if something's already

904
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,159
in say you know virus total and you have

905
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,159
that it will flag it we've also flagged

906
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,039
um safe scripts yeah um which is kind of

907
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,480
the reverse of that but still somewhat

908
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,320
helpful uh so we've got things that are

909
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,519
marked safe

910
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,200
from

911
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,720
uh yeah for like a

912
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,440
cdn gs so all the libraries that are

913
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,720
known on cdngs as legitimate will be

914
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,039
flagged on the site like on the capture

915
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,279
as legitimate i mean again like

916
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,480
legitimate is not the right word

917
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,399
basically as at least

918
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,799
a known javascript

919
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,720
from a library that is

920
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
existing and has been published

921
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,880
uh so that's like one of them

922
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,240
uh aren't

923
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,480
uh yeah on the first question i think it

924
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,399
was the uh just basically we need the

925
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,960
har file uh yeah so for yeah for like

926
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,159
the first question like when you have

927
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,560
like um like if you if you have a con

928
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,839
page content

929
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,839
you cannot just submit that to lukitu

930
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:14,639
like

931
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,199
that would be interesting the thing is

932
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,119
right now what it does is really takes a

933
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,879
url load it in the browser and generate

934
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,079
http archive blob

935
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,359
it's using the har file to do that so

936
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,800
i mean you'd have to pick at it a little

937
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,399
bit but it would be entirely possible to

938
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,159
feed it a stream of those but that's the

939
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,560
format that's that it's expecting

940
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,800
so yeah if you have

941
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,359
uh like if you have cap like if you like

942
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,000
capture websites and you get the hr

943
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,839
outputs or the http archive output

944
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,639
somehow you can load it into lokido it's

945
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,079
not like easy to do right now but that's

946
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,839
something we could do in the future just

947
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,599
like using that and then generating a

948
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,359
tree out of it certainly if that's if

949
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,879
that's a more common use case we can

950
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,400
implement that yeah

951
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,200
okay uh last question

952
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,160
hey regarding the artifacts uh from the

953
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,160
capture and you

954
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,920
mentioned they are being saved locally

955
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,359
on the machine

956
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,160
it is just a csv or some other like a

957
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,079
json or is it a structure so it's start

958
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,720
in http archive blob so it's like in

959
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,680
json and so basically you have like h

960
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,720
air file has like it's a json document

961
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,440
that contains all the requests and all

962
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,720
the artifacts are stored in base64

963
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,440
encoded in the json itself so it's a

964
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,200
really it can be a really big json

965
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,240
document that contains everything

966
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,560
thank you

967
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,750
