nicholas from nvizil who's going to talk

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,840
about something that

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,960
is or at least should be important to

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,800
to everyone else

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,960

thank you um so my talk today is about

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,680
documentation more specifically about um

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,440
keep creating and maintaining your

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,199
knowledge base within your team or

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,840
organization

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,480
so i'm nicholas zaire i work as a soccer

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,719
analyst at nvizo

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,120
i created the knowledge base within our

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,479
team and i help maintain it

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,680
and viso

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,240
is a cyber security company in europe

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,080
we do quite a lot in security itself we

30
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,040
have pen testers red teamers

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,439
we help you with your policies

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,600
we have an incident response team we

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,920
help you with your cloud stuff and

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,280
of course a sock team

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,079
so today we're going to talk about

36
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,000
a bit how the situation was at nvizo

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,520
when i joined and how the situation was

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,600
regarding the documentation

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,479
at some point i changed my tactics

40
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,280
when creating the documentation

41
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,439
we have some lessons learned from that

42
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,560
and

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,079
lastly i will

44
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,320
give a brie give a brief overview what i

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,839
want to do in the future as well

46
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,439
so

47
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,360
it started all off with

48
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,840
a lot of confluence pages

49
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,280
everywhere with some documentation in it

50
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,080
and nobody actually knew what was in

51
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,038
those pages and where they actually were

52
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,760
so first of all i had to

53
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,560
create a bit of a structure

54
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,160
i started off

55
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,239
getting gathering all the pages looking

56
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,440
through them

57
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,000
there was a lot of text in there and

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,400
nobody actually used them

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,200
so what i did was i gathered them all

60
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,800
put them in a nice structure and then

61
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,239
i went through them

62
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,400
deleted a few things added some

63
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,000
few things and

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,480
um at some point i was

65
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,879
sitting there we have no goal what do we

66
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,519
actually want to document um

67
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,959
at nvizo we wanted to document

68
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,959
our training processes and our work life

69
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,200
cycle so that we can give the

70
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
documentation to

71
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,239
new analysts so they can start working

72
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,360
for us very fast and

73
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,280
they work

74
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,080
using the

75
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,920
the um expectancies that are the the

76
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,000
quality that our customers expect from

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,800
us

78
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,040
um

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,879
so the first step is define your goals

80
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,040
when you create your documentation what

81
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,760
we did as well was you need to have a

82
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,680
goal what do you want your knowledge

83
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,879
base to be

84
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,959
why do people need to go to your

85
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,360
knowledge base for us that was

86
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,120
the training and

87
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,280
training of new analysts then you have

88
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,239
to prioritize what exactly within those

89
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,040
goals do you want to do

90
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,760
after that you choose one topic that you

91
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,599
want to focus on and you give that to

92
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,000
one person that one person is your point

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,200
of contact

94
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,319
basically some kind of digital librarian

95
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,200
that knows everything within that small

96
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,599
topic

97
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,599
okay

98
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,840
oops

99
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,000
so defining your goal

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,560
what do you need to document that is the

101
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,560
most important question what is it that

102
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,040
you need to document are it policies is

103
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,360
it a training is it code that you need

104
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,519
to document that's very important to

105
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,798
know beforehand before you start and

106
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,798
then you need to know why do you want to

107
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,520
do that in our case it was for training

108
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,280
it was training exercises it was

109
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,759
training um

110
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,360
links to other blogs to videos

111
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,320
um

112
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,199
and how you want to do that that is

113
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,000
um

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,639
very important to know beforehand

115
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,360
so that you need to use the right tools

116
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,280
is it video that you need

117
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,080
then you probably need a platform like

118
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,360
youtube or any other internal platform

119
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,560
that you need

120
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,160
are you going to use confluence or

121
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,600
another knowledge base maybe a wiki

122
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,000
um priorities you have to get them

123
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,039
straight uh our two priorities was um

124
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,600
the training and the um life cycle that

125
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,560
we had

126
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,360
and

127
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,680
when you have those priorities listed up

128
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,720
you choose one of them

129
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,840
after that

130
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,759
you choose a person who is responsible

131
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,960
for that

132
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,520
i was responsible for both

133
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,000
this person knows the content

134
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,440
content that's in there he knows okay

135
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,680
if you want to know more about phishing

136
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,320
let's say you go to there

137
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,960
he knows the structure he is the person

138
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,520
um the point of contact for everything

139
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,479
within that one topic so if people have

140
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,639
questions they say oh yeah i'm looking

141
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,400
for um let's say some queries or um how

142
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,199
do we exactly um classify a certain

143
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,639
types of um emails they can go to him

144
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,800
and that person says okay yeah just here

145
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,600
is a url visit that and you have all the

146
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,440
information that

147
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,919
you need

148
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,160
ideally that person is

149
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,120
the one with the most documentation

150
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,199
that does the most documentation and has

151
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,280
the most experience with documentation

152
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,520
but that doesn't have to be it can

153
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,039
literally be

154
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,600
someone that you just hired yesterday

155
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,919
it doesn't matter

156
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:16,990
and

157
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,720
[Music]

158
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,960
that brings me to the next point

159
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,160
different people have different

160
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,520
responsibilities

161
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,600
not only within creating your knowledge

162
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,639
base but also within the company you

163
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,960
cannot say oh yes this is the most

164
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,120
experienced senior person let's have him

165
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,479
do it everything no

166
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,199
example given here is documentation you

167
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,520
can give that to someone you just hired

168
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,520
they just need to know a bit

169
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,719
about what the structure is

170
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,400
um

171
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,199
when you are doing this documentation

172
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,160
you've created this we're about three to

173
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,840
four months

174
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,520
in the

175
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,599
work that i did with nvizo for creating

176
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,039
our knowledge base

177
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,479
we had some problems so we did a meeting

178
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,599
where we doc um a whole day we spent on

179
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,520
documenting documenting things that

180
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,120
everyone was saying yeah i need to

181
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,960
document this but i never have the time

182
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,160
for this

183
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,479
we created a fun event out of it we got

184
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,160
some pizzas or if you want salad

185
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,759
it doesn't really matter

186
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,800
so that

187
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,120
documentation is not always the most fun

188
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,680
part so let's make it a bit more fun

189
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,960
um

190
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,919
so everyone was documenting things um

191
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,800
the point of contact me in this case um

192
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,919
i was validating okay what what is the

193
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,960
stuff that we already have can we add

194
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,039
some new things okay

195
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,400
um

196
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,319
i cleaned up a lot of the things that

197
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,560
were already being

198
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,919
deprecated

199
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:54,960
and

200
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
at the end of the day i reviewed

201
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,479
everything that we have

202
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,440
and

203
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,080
this is one of the most important things

204
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,599
i explained our structure um everything

205
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,560
that was new i showed

206
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,199
hey guys so this is everything that we

207
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,000
have within our topic um within training

208
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,319
you can find everything here everyone

209
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,840
knew in our team what was in our

210
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,160
knowledge base they didn't know exactly

211
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,120
where it was or um

212
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,000
um what was the content itself it was

213
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,479
but i knew okay we have documentation

214
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,000
about phishing we have documentation

215
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,240
about creating um a vm we have

216
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,399
documentation about how to analyze

217
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,000
malware um

218
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,959
some point i also changed my tactics um

219
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,959
we had some issues as well

220
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,440
one one of the things i started using

221
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,200
was polarity

222
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,920
initially polarity is not meant for

223
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,519
creating documentation it is more used

224
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,120
for helping

225
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,760
stock analysts or ir teams

226
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,160
with their investigation

227
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,839
it has integration for a lot of um

228
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,959
api calls that they um use like

229
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,640
firestore url scan

230
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,300
shodan

231
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,600
[Music]

232
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,360
confluence jira

233
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,040
a lot of different

234
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,920
apis that i can use to actually

235
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,439
get information back

236
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,360
but

237
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,560
it has one

238
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,680
key feature that was very important for

239
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,360
us you could

240
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,160
set some text on something you could

241
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,720
highlight something you get some text

242
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,060
and

243
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,560
[Music]

244
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,480
that is some information that you share

245
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,560
with the team that

246
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,440
uses polarity as well one of the very

247
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,040
important things

248
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,240
polarity does is using ocr that means

249
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,279
that even on images

250
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,399
or screenshots or when you're in a vm it

251
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,040
actually shows you the information that

252
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,640
you need

253
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,680
so

254
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,079
one of the tags that we created was um

255
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,959
for cmd.xy um

256
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,959
how do attackers use cmd.xy

257
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,200
we said some com some examples we

258
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,279
explained a little bit about how it's

259
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,399
being used by attackers um

260
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,600
and we we have a whole list of um lol

261
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,000
bins being um

262
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,240
documented in polarity and it's

263
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,360
basically like an um

264
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,680
senior analyst um saying

265
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,560
look

266
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,839
cmd.lexi or regardless um rec svr.32.xe

267
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,399
is being used like this and

268
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,839
most of the time when you see these

269
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,360
things

270
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,959
they are not really important but

271
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,640
if you see this and you have the

272
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,880
documentation right next to you

273
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,079
then you see oh yeah right this is

274
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,600
something that i need to look out for

275
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,160
this is something malicious and

276
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,519
that is how we are creating our dynamic

277
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,720
knowledge base

278
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,320
it's like i said a senior analyst

279
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,120
sitting next to you saying look i know

280
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,640
this i've seen this before

281
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,360
um one of the things that we did as well

282
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,060
was changing from the

283
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,560
[Music]

284
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,839
lots of text to um going more for

285
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,399
queries based documentation because we

286
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,720
were using a lot of hunting queries in

287
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,399
azure um or mde in elastic in palo alto

288
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,560
xdr

289
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,040
xzr doesn't have the best documentation

290
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,000
as well or um the best

291
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,560
examples so i needed to provide some

292
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,440
because

293
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,839
we need to work very fast in our stock

294
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,079
we have a lot of alerts we need to get

295
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,079
through them we need to hunt for a lot

296
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,600
of stuff so um we had to have that

297
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,839
information present that you could just

298
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,040
say copy this template put it somewhere

299
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,519
change the device name maybe

300
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,160
the file name and you have your

301
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,680
queries and your results in no time this

302
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,480
is this was very important and

303
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,120
it doesn't require a lot of text

304
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,800
you just have a few comments in your

305
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
codes or in your query

306
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,360
you have a small line that says that

307
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,120
that has a little bit of an explanation

308
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,760
about the query and everyone can work

309
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,079
with it

310
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,440
um at some point our

311
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,320
documentation looked a bit like this

312
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,519
where we had

313
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,399
our

314
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,959
normal worklight workflow

315
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,240
described a bit and then for every um

316
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,560
alert that we could get we

317
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,880
set a small example of what the alert

318
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,360
was we explained a bit um why we handle

319
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,519
the alerts and we put some queries in

320
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,000
there as well um that ev that our new

321
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,240
analysts can get up to speed real quick

322
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,120
and in a month or two they have the um

323
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,480
capacity and knowledge and

324
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
experience that our customer ex

325
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,760
customers expect from us

326
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,920
so

327
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,120
that brings me to the lessons learned um

328
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,519
if you have fallen asleep a little bit

329
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,519
um or didn't um pay much attention i

330
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,440
invite you to take a picture of this

331
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,079
slide this is the most important slide

332
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,230
in my whole presentation um

333
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,680
[Music]

334
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,160
one of the important things in

335
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,880
creating your knowledge base is

336
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,560
you don't have to plan everything from

337
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,680
the start

338
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,760
planning don't get me wrong planning is

339
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,560
a very important part of

340
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,600
your

341
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,839
creating your knowledge base but

342
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,240
at some point you will get

343
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,399
like a year half a year

344
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,720
after the initial start of creating your

345
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,120
knowledge base you will need some extra

346
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,399
things because

347
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,199
life in the company the work it changes

348
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,160
changes a little bit

349
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,560
you have all also always have to ask

350
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,839
yourself

351
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,880
what am i documenting is it usable

352
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,959
is this something that people will go

353
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,639
back to

354
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,720
one of the problems that we had was a

355
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,199
lot of text and i mean a lot of text

356
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,199
where we try to explain everything about

357
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,519
phishing everything about malware it

358
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,399
took us a very long time to create

359
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,760
or

360
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,000
create one of those pages

361
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,040
and

362
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,519
they were not re usable nobody

363
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,240
looked at that because well that was one

364
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,920
already created in one of the training

365
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,360
pages and two well our analysts knew

366
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,600
what phishing was our annual analyst

367
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,480
knew um what alerts they were going to

368
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,720
handle so they didn't need that

369
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,959
explanation anymore we taught them that

370
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,120
in live sessions when we were sitting

371
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,199
together and showing of our platform and

372
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,040
our workflow so

373
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,079
that is

374
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,920
lost time

375
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,519
um

376
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,519
that also brings me a bit to the next

377
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,519
point which is document as

378
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,560
much or as little as you need

379
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,240
sometimes you just have to get to the

380
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,600
point

381
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,120
other times maybe when you're

382
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,160
documenting some type of policy or

383
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,079
when you create your knowledge base

384
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,440
about

385
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,340
a certain

386
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,600
[Music]

387
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,199
workflow that you do and have a lot of

388
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,279
steps then you need to document all

389
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,920
those steps but if you don't have that

390
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
just one step

391
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,959
put in that one step step and

392
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,519
maybe it's a one page that has like five

393
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,639
lines on it

394
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,199
so be it it's usable

395
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,399
um

396
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,199
and

397
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,320
revisit

398
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,160
uh your documentation every three to

399
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,079
four months create

400
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,399
some kind of fun event over it so that

401
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,000
everyone knows what exactly is within um

402
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,199
your knowledge base so everyone knows

403
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,240
where some things can be found um you

404
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,639
you can clean up the deprecated stuff

405
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,240
because in three to four months

406
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,279
something that might be useful um three

407
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,560
to four months ago is not usable anymore

408
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,519
and you can that way you clean up your

409
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,680
knowledge base you keep it up to date

410
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,560
and

411
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,120
everyone knows where everything is so it

412
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,480
will be used

413
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,519
um

414
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,920
that is also create some fun event out

415
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,720
of it because these days are usually not

416
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,000
always the

417
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,480
most pleasant days the maybe a bit more

418
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,440
boring so give some incentive

419
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,519
um change is good

420
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,279
if you didn't change your knowledge base

421
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,240
well

422
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,839
um everything within the um security

423
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,079
industry is changing so why not your

424
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,759
knowledge base as well

425
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,720
right and focus on the present you don't

426
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,800
have a librarian working for you nobody

427
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,040
wants to pay for that so

428
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,800
only document the things that you know

429
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,959
that you need right now and not the

430
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,600
things that you think oh maybe i can use

431
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,440
this next year

432
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,280
no you will not use it next year because

433
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,919
you've forgotten that it was there and

434
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,199
um nobody you you lost time on that and

435
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,520
nobody nobody wants that they're going

436
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,199
to think yeah

437
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,599
what is this we don't need this we don't

438
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,760
use something like this this is

439
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,839
maybe a policy or

440
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,240
a way of thinking that we change

441
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,760
that was

442
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,359
something from last year and we don't

443
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,678
use it anymore

444
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,400
so

445
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,160
how would i do it different in the

446
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,679
future

447
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,240
one of the things is i would

448
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,400
start using obsidian

449
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,440
obsidian um in my opinion is a very good

450
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,760
tool because it is um

451
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,039
a whole um fully written in markdown so

452
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,880
you can use it basically everywhere

453
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,000
markdown is um basically a markup

454
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,120
language that is just text

455
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,760
so you can easily port it to every other

456
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,120
thing if you decide on changing tools

457
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,840
and you can use it locally you can also

458
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,240
use it in the cloud

459
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,559
markdown has a very

460
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,200
nifty feature that has backlinks so you

461
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,440
can really click

462
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,559
back to

463
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,200
other pages very fast and pivot from

464
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,679
there that's also something with

465
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,240
the mind maps that's being created

466
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,039
here

467
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,000
you can see that the mind maps

468
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,360
have

469
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
linked basically

470
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,440
every page together

471
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,640
and if there is like a specific attack

472
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,320
or um

473
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,960
specific tactic being used or documented

474
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,400
then you can pivot from there okay um

475
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,799
if you combine your

476
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,640
documentation with your red teaming

477
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,280
documentation okay the red teamers they

478
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,039
have documented

479
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,000
a specific attack how is that being used

480
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,559
so you don't um

481
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,120
so you already have saw

482
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,960
the documentation from

483
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,039
other teams in the in your own

484
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,840
documentation basically with a quick

485
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,360
overview that you can pivot to

486
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,720
[Music]

487
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,200
it also use the open format

488
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,720
markdown it has a lot of plugins

489
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,520
it's like if you ever used visual studio

490
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,000
code this is visual studio code for

491
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,640
markdown files

492
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,039
it's very easy to work with and if you

493
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,720
copy paste something

494
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,039
from any website it actually keeps it

495
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,720
format

496
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,120
visual studio code does not do that it's

497
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,280
infu it

498
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,160
infuriates me really

499
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,440
pasting of images also very easy

500
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,520
that is one of the things that most

501
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,080
markdown editors don't have

502
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,720
an easily easy way to paste images

503
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,320
because usually you have to type some

504
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,200
code

505
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,960
or markdown code

506
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,400
for that

507
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,679
also

508
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,960
you can use

509
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,559
obsidian with

510
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,640
github real easy to have some version

511
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,320
control um

512
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,960
you can share your files

513
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,200
very easy because well it's just a

514
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
github repository

515
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,440
i don't know if you ever heard from

516
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,720
get her pages but get her pages there is

517
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,320
a way to

518
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,640
put markdown files as a website and

519
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,200
it updates automatically

520
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,080
which means that whatever co

521
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,799
documentation you wrote within your

522
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,320
obsidian and

523
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,720
put onto your github is already on your

524
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,799
website

525
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,520
and

526
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,039
if you're like us using some codes some

527
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,080
queries

528
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,320
within your documentation it's all in

529
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,960
one location

530
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,400
so that was my talk are there any more

531
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,930
questions

532
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:09,150
[Applause]

533
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,840
hi if i understood you correctly at the

534
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,400
beginning you recommended to have

535
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,360
one person being in charge of a topic

536
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,960
and and

537
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,720
knowing more or less

538
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,679
where

539
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,240
which information is is documented and

540
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,520
stored

541
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,320
so

542
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,679
you did you mean that um

543
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,000
you would divide your team

544
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,320
into topics and then tell everybody

545
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,840
you're responsible for this topic and

546
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,120
you need to know where the documentation

547
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,400
is and you're responsible for this other

548
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,200
topic or did you mean something else so

549
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,880
yes

550
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,039
one of the examples that i used was we

551
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,080
had our

552
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,240
we needed to document our workflows and

553
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,400
we needed to document our training

554
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,240
processes and

555
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,559
you could see each of those as a topic

556
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,520
and

557
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,280
depending on how big

558
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,679
the topic is you can say okay one person

559
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,919
knows everything about workflows and one

560
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,679
person knows everything about the

561
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,720
training program and um those peoples

562
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,679
are in charge so if you need to add

563
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,360
something to the training you can go to

564
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,600
them okay look um

565
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,760
we have training about let's say global

566
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,520
strike i want to create a page about

567
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,240
global strike to um so that people know

568
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,880
what it is um we can train them about

569
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,799
cobalt strike then you can go to that

570
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,679
person ask okay how do i where do i put

571
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:30,559
it

572
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,080
and what is a bit of the format that i

573
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,440
can use

574
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,120
same for the workflows

575
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,640
if you decide to create a new workflow

576
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,360
you can ask that person and then um say

577
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,360
okay he knows where everything is and um

578
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,240
or

579
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,520
you you know

580
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,280
you already have a page about immoted

581
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,760
and you asked the your point of contact

582
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,000
of one topic okay i want to know more

583
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,480
about emote that's where can i find this

584
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,760
and do you have them in some kind of a

585
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,600
register these are the topics and these

586
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,520
are responsible people or

587
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,320
um at the moment we do not have that but

588
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,640
if this is something if you have a lot

589
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,720
of topics that is a very good idea

590
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,400
indeed okay thanks

591
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,720
so similar question so

592
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,960
how many topics currently you think

593
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,840
about is it five or is it 50

594
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,039
um

595
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,200
that's is completely up to your

596
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,840
organization and what your needs are but

597
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,960
um

598
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,760
at the moment in our small sock team we

599
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,760
have uh three topics

600
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,520
and small teammates

601
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,159
still you have 15 people

602
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,880
at the moment we have seven people

603
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,200
thank you

604
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,200
hello hello wrong

605
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,480
uh

606
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,120
it's kind of related to that but my

607
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,400
question is

608
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,720
which type of problems that you face to

609
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,720
scale up documents

610
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,440
and maintain quality

611
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,600
do you have any

612
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,400
or strategy on that yes so

613
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,520
um this is why you need to revisit your

614
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,360
knowledge base every three to four

615
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,880
months to um so that everyone knows what

616
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,080
is in your

617
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,960
knowledge base so that every um you can

618
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,200
clean up your knowledge base and you

619
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,640
keep it can keep it up to date and um as

620
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,760
long as you have um a responsible person

621
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,120
for each topic they keep their own

622
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,840
topic up to date and that is very

623
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,640
scalable as long as you have the people

624
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,240
that you can add

625
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,960
to your topics

626
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,799
do you have any specific metric or

627
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,120
i know i don't know data that you look

628
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,240
at to

629
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,000
to see what is

630
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,120
being kind of dusty or

631
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,840
so

632
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,039
um that

633
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,039
probably depends on the program that

634
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,320
you're using um confluence has um

635
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,960
this metric that shows you how many

636
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,559
people have viewed

637
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,440
a specific page you can um base yourself

638
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,400
on that

639
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,440
um

640
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,200
other than that maybe you can do a

641
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,159
survey if you don't have um that that

642
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,000
information you can do a survey within

643
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,520
the company okay

644
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,159
um do you use the knowledge base um do

645
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,279
you know how to use it um

646
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,799
and a few of those

647
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,840
basic questions that you want answered

648
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,600
perfect thank you you're welcome

649
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,279
any other questions

650
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,039
question uh

651
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,440
you mentioned that the objective so far

652
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,159
for you it was only one the

653
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,799
uh education for new analysts

654
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,120
but there are other reasons so

655
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,039
other topics are other goals what could

656
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,279
be implemented easily or in the future

657
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,799
so do you have a

658
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,600
road map for example but on board the

659
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
you know documenting over all policies

660
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,360
procedures in order to ensure its

661
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,120
compliance with i don't know whatever

662
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,039
quality and

663
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,960
at the moment in our

664
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,120
analyst team we do not have a roadmap

665
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,400
yet

666
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,660
we are still

667
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,880
[Music]

668
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,279
in the phase where we are creating all

669
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,240
the

670
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,440
documentation for the new analysts and

671
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,279
when that is done we are going to

672
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,320
revisit um our ghost what what do we

673
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,640
want to document next

674
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,840
um but if that is a requirement for your

675
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,240
company you can really

676
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,159
sit together with maybe all of

677
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,600
management or um the people that um need

678
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,559
to make a decision decision about it and

679
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,799
um create your roadmap okay what do we

680
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,120
want to be documented what do we

681
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,159
prioritize within um all of those things

682
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,679
that we need to document what is the

683
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,960
most time

684
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,600
sensitive to be documented and then you

685
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,320
can

686
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,240
start giving out those tasks

687
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,960
okay and another short question

688
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,080
of your personal of your time how much

689
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,039
it took uh for last i know three months

690
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,600
these activities managing and

691
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,720
making it work it's 100 or 15 percent

692
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,159
um i would say about

693
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,360
10 to

694
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,880
15

695
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,240
of my time is spent on documenting and

696
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,760
um

697
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,320
[Music]

698
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,559
it's really helps to have that one

699
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,039
specific day every three to four months

700
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,240
to

701
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,720
have my full time spent on um

702
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,880
documentation because i don't need to

703
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,600
take a specific break um

704
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,520
because i have other alerts to work on

705
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,760
but i can clean out i can keep the

706
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,279
structure a bit more um so yeah that

707
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,039
helps with the time management

708
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,679
all right uh thank you for uh engaging

709
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,720
subject

710
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,600
and i do have a question myself also

711
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,440
you mentioned quite a lot of tools there

712
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,600
and i do recognize some of them is there

713
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,279
anyone in particular you would like to

714
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,320
recommend

715
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,919
um so

716
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,880
the whole idea is that it is not based

717
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,480
on a specific tool yes we do use some

718
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,480
specific tools because we have a use for

719
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,320
them but um don't bind yourself to a

720
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,640
specific tool unless you need a specific

721
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,679
reason to use it like polarity

722
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,320
our specific reason to use it is because

723
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,000
um it has that

724
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,039
dynamic

725
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,360
knowledge base um feature that you can

726
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,600
just add a comment to something

727
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,360
um but

728
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,440
if you're using obsidian or if you're

729
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,240
using confluence doesn't really matter

730
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,360
unless you

731
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,240
you use confluence maybe with jira and

732
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,720
you need that integration

733
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,440
or

734
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,600
for obsidian if you really wanted mind

735
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,399
map

736
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,880
then use that tool so

737
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,799
whatever tool works for you use it

738
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,000
all right

739
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,399
then i i thank you nicholas for taking

740
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,240

742
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,240
