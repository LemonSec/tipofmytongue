00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,760
hello everyone

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,240
i want to remember that the current

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,559
session will be a tlp-1

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,480
and the session name is formulating an

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,840
intelligence drive and threat hunting

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,960
methodology and helped me to

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,320
give a welcome to joe slow week

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,880
and enjoy the session

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,198
thank you

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,840
there's our works there's the title hi

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,640
i'm joe uh who is joe uh joe likes

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,800
ronnie james dio so if you uh follow my

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,559
twitter profile up until very recently

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,399
you would see that infatuation

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,440
um so currently i lead threat detection

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,960
threat intelligence and detections

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,280
engineering for gigamon you may know me

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,360
from prior roles at domain tools and

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,039
dragos and i also have a background in

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,520
incident response and similar operations

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,280
in the us government but that's enough

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,440
about me what are we going to talk about

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,879
today we're going to talk about threat

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,359
hunting uh we'll talk about defining

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,199
what that means initially because it's

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,680
good to have a set of definitions and

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,119
clear understanding of what it is we'll

29
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,760
be communicating about and then get into

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,720
an actual process of threat hunting

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,799
looking at this as a repeatable

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,200
sustainable sort of process talk through

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,600
a couple of examples and then shift into

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,479
how hunting can fuel a detection

35
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,080
development process which is something

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,080
very near and dear to my heart so we

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,520
don't have that much time for a lot of

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,920
content so let's dive in and see what we

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,960
can find

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,640
so first hunting

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,799
we have this idea that hunting is a

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,560
process that we should be engaged in

43
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,119
when we throw this idea around within

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,280
information security circles but we

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,399
don't really

46
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,799
spend much time typically defining what

47
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,320
hunting means just that it's something

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,680
we should be doing

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,520
so certainly there are some definitions

50
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,040
that are out there typically in the form

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,640
of marketing related blogs from

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,280
information security companies but we do

53
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
at least get some idea that hunting is

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,000
this sort of proactive process to try to

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,640
identify the intrusions that we missed

56
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,880
the first time around so in looking at

57
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,200
that hunting in brief is really just

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,720
trying to identify those things that the

59
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,639
sock might have gotten what might have

60
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,959
gotten by the sock the first time around

61
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,800
identifying the adversary that made it

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,200
past our defenses

63
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,640
as they were structured at a certain

64
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,200
point in time and supporting saw and

65
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,440
incident response by identifying these

66
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,000
adversaries and these unknown intrusions

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and also as a way to supplement our more

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,840
automated security controls and

69
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,080
detections through a manual and very

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,720
interactive process so that seems

71
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,280
reasonable enough as hunting conceived

72
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
but how do we actually go about this

73
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,360
process in a way that is sustainable and

74
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,000
can continue moving forward well we

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,200
start by understanding what the

76
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,120
components of threat hunting are and

77
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,560
that's not just a

78
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,720
concept of what questions we need to ask

79
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,480
who are my threat actors what are they

80
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,239
doing and what are the technical

81
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,680
observations related to those

82
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,000
adversaries but also understanding what

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,720
visibility i have that allows me to ask

84
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,239
questions and try to find these

85
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,640
adversaries so how do i identify these

86
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,560
threat actors and what are the resources

87
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,720
that i have available in order to start

88
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,239
conducting a threat hunting uh process

89
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,000
so when looking for the prerequisites

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,760
for hunting what are we talking about so

91
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,519
again hunting is something we should do

92
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,800
but it's certainly something that we

93
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,720
also need resources and capabilities to

94
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,200
execute it in a meaningful fashion

95
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,599
so from a hunting perspective first and

96
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,599
foremost in my opinion and i have a

97
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,280
strong threat intelligence background so

98
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,360
i may be biased is understanding our

99
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,879
adversaries that doesn't mean

100
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,560
understanding who they are but rather

101
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,720
how they operate and we'll talk to that

102
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,120
in a bit here momentarily but in

103
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,400
addition to understanding who our

104
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,319
adversaries are we also have to have

105
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,799
certain competencies in terms of asking

106
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,760
questions and data or telemetry that we

107
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,159
could use to ask questions of and it's

108
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,640
by combining these three perspectives

109
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,720
that we can start developing the

110
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,040
background necessary to conduct

111
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,959
meaningful threat hunts

112
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,480
so when looking at this we can start

113
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,920
migrating

114
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,000
a in a fashion from data to

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,720
understanding understanding first who

116
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,840
are our threats and what are the

117
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,080
artifacts related to their behaviors or

118
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,680
how they operate

119
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,760
then based upon my threats figure out

120
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,160
what's my underlying visibility how do i

121
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,680
start identifying how these threats

122
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,240
operate what are the options that i have

123
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,080
available to identify artifacts of

124
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,960
threat actor activity and then how do i

125
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,360
ask questions of this data in order to

126
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,759
reveal these artifacts of adversary

127
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,479
behaviors how do i query my data am i

128
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,199
typing queries in splunk and elk in

129
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,919
some other sim or tool or am i looking

130
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,000
through raw logs and raw data sources

131
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,919
and what is the scope of that and how

132
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,919
does it relate back to the adversaries

133
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,520
that i care about

134
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,199
so now we're starting to get into a more

135
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,280
fundamental way of asking questions and

136
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,639
understanding how this relates to

137
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,199
underlying data let's expand this a bit

138
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,880
further instead of just saying oh go

139
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,400
understand adversaries and go ask

140
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,800
questions in your data set because the

141
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,479
problem is is that often we're left

142
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,560
hunting in isolation where we have

143
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,240
either a very narrow view of what's

144
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,759
going on in our environment or we just

145
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,400
simply don't have the data sources

146
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,199
necessary to query or to

147
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,440
look for adversary activity within our

148
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,680
environment that's not good so instead

149
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,520
we want to try to improve our visibility

150
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,600
or at least understand what's necessary

151
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,560
to improve the or expand the aperture of

152
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,160
our visibility so that we can get a

153
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,000
better sense of what's going on now

154
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,080
you'll notice in this gif that the

155
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,160
entire room is not illuminated because

156
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,560
we'll never have complete visibility

157
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,000
that would be very hard we would

158
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
probably be overwhelmed with data but we

159
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,160
do need to expand our scope to such an

160
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,560
extent that we can at least begin asking

161
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,880
more relevant questions and begin

162
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,199
linking observations of potential threat

163
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,600
actor activity to come up with a more

164
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,560
refined look of what's going on

165
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,720
now as part of this we might also try to

166
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
develop a model uh one of the things

167
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,840
that

168
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,600
informed my

169
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,880
thinking about this subject and it's

170
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,400
something that i'm trying to write a

171
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,080
paper about as well so stay tuned for

172
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
that but i've been delayed so you have

173
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,720
to wait for that a little bit longer is

174
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,039
looking at this in a very systematic way

175
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,039
such as hypothesis testing as we're

176
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,720
familiar with in

177
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,240
various other forms of research and

178
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,080
statistical analysis

179
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,160
can we also in addition to expanding our

180
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,960
visibility take a perspective where we

181
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,199
can start evaluating the questions that

182
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,520
we're asking in a very systematic way to

183
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,600
see if we're on the right track or wrong

184
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,880
track if we're asking the right

185
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,680
questions or misleading questions and if

186
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,240
there's a way to evaluate our hunting

187
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,039
hypotheses in such a fashion that we can

188
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,000
add some statistical or other rigor to

189
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,720
it to improve our processes over time

190
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,319
so if we start expanding this a little

191
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,400
bit what does our hunting process then

192
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,919
begin to look like so we know we need to

193
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,360
understand our adversaries we know we

194
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,440
need data and we know we need to have

195
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,599
some way of evaluating this but if we're

196
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,160
putting together a series of

197
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,800
steps in generating testable hunting

198
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,720
hypotheses we first need to understand

199
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
adversary operations then we need to

200
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,280
understand what visibility we possess in

201
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,360
order to look for those adversaries then

202
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,960
we also need to have an understanding of

203
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,360
fundamental risks to our organization

204
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,120
because we can't just ask any question

205
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,520
or we certainly could but in doing so

206
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,880
we're likely going to waste time and

207
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,199
resources instead of focusing on things

208
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,120
that we should that are simply important

209
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,560
for the organization we're trying to

210
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,520
defend so if we start looking at these

211
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,240
three concepts as being the integral

212
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,120
parts of a threat hunting program what

213
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,280
do these look like in greater detail

214
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,000
well first if i'm looking at hypothesis

215
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,400
development the central aspect of a

216
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,840
hypothesis is that this is something

217
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,919
that is testable i'm asking questions

218
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,400
that i can evaluate that i can determine

219
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
whether or not they are meaningful

220
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,280
impactful actionable so in doing this i

221
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,360
want to formulate questions in such a

222
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,520
way that they are specific you know not

223
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,039
just i want to look for bad activity

224
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,599
like no i need to identify a very

225
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,080
specific element of bad actor operations

226
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,680
that i'm looking for they need to be

227
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,440
measurable which seems like it's obvious

228
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,360
since we're dealing with data sets in

229
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,520
this case so that shouldn't be too big

230
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,639
of a deal

231
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,639
detectable as well if i'm formulating a

232
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,599
hypothesis i should be able to identify

233
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,360
artifacts related to that question

234
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,440
within the data that's available to me

235
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,360
relevant to my organization so not

236
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,800
looking for

237
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
sms based phishing for

238
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,120
android ecosystem devices if i'm running

239
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,520
ios with an mdm solution or something

240
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,599
like that i want to relate these items

241
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,159
to the environment that i'm operating in

242
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,958
timely related to operations and related

243
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,519
to how the adversary is operating so i'm

244
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,760
not looking for activities that occurred

245
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,519
years ago or that are artifacts of

246
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,000
historical operations but rather reflect

247
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,680
the state of the now and what might be

248
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,240
going on on my network at this time and

249
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,720
then finally testable i can evaluate

250
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,320
whether or not the hypothesis i

251
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,000
developed was good

252
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,839
effective and if i found what i was

253
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,440
looking for or if i didn't i could

254
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,040
understand why either that's because

255
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,880
there really was none of the activity

256
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,720
that i was looking for present or i need

257
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,880
to refine my questions and my way of

258
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,360
evaluating them to better understand and

259
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,600
better evaluate how to get at those

260
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,200
results

261
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,440
so the first component of building these

262
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,600
hypotheses is understanding adversaries

263
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,040
so what threats are operating in the

264
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,440
space that i'm operating within so maybe

265
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,839
in the financial sector

266
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:25,040
telecommunications medical industrial

267
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,920
controls etc and then understanding how

268
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,480
the adversaries within that ecosystem

269
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,880
operate do i have adversaries that are

270
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,399
using extensive living off the land

271
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,519
techniques they use custom malware they

272
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,160
fish in a certain sort of way and

273
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,920
figuring out what are the fundamental

274
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,839
behavioral aspects of these adversaries

275
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,680
to start understanding what are the

276
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,600
behaviors i need to start looking for

277
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,000
within my data and the sort of questions

278
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,399
i need to start asking

279
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,320
yeah so if i'm looking at understanding

280
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,160
adversary operations i have options

281
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,560
available to me i can look at cti

282
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,560
frameworks like diamond model analysis

283
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,560
kill chain analysis miter attack mapping

284
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,680
etc

285
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,760
i could also focus on tools like

286
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,440
evaluating cobalt strike because

287
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,360
everyone uses cobalt strike except if

288
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,360
you were in the ukrainian search session

289
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,880
uh just before you would have heard

290
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,040
impact mentioned many times so

291
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,079
understanding what sort of tools and

292
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,000
capabilities the adversaries that you

293
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,600
care about are operating so that you're

294
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,680
evaluating the right technologies the

295
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,440
right capabilities and understanding how

296
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,640
they function

297
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,880
so in doing this we want to

298
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,560
drive ourselves towards a

299
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,160
intelligence-based understanding of

300
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,480
what's going on not just identifying

301
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,240
what adversaries are of interest to me

302
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,160
but more importantly how do these

303
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,720
adversaries operate this last part is a

304
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,160
little bit difficult

305
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,320
it could be valuable if we can identify

306
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,160
what our adversary's goals are are they

307
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,600
ransomware adversaries are they

308
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,519
intellectual property stealers are they

309
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,040
trying to monetize our network in some

310
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,760
other fashion uh that could help direct

311
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,640
certain

312
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,160
efforts uh certainly in terms of

313
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,000
timeliness if i have a short time to

314
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,600
live before the deployment of ransomware

315
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,040
and so forth

316
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,640
but while this is a nice to have we

317
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,240
really need to focus on these higher

318
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,480
level items of just figuring out who are

319
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,160
the threats that are of primary concern

320
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,240
to us and how they operate on a very

321
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,399
technical level anything after that is a

322
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,640
bonus and likely very hard to get to

323
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,079
that also gets us into questions of

324
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,920
attribution and so forth and that's a

325
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,680
completely different and very unsavory

326
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,480
topic that we won't get into today

327
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,320
okay so we talk adversaries we need to

328
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,760
know who our adversaries are and how

329
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,760
they operate well just knowing how

330
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,920
adversaries operate is insufficient to

331
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,760
start developing hunting criteria

332
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,440
because now i need to figure out all

333
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
right if this is how adversaries operate

334
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,200
what data sets do i have available to

335
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,720
look for artifacts related to their

336
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,040
operation so that includes what sensors

337
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,160
do i have what activity can i see do i

338
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,800
have a endpoint visibility product do i

339
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,720
have network visibility is my network

340
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,040
visibility only ingress and egress

341
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,959
traffic within my network or can i see

342
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,399
lateral movement

343
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,560
activity as well both on the network and

344
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,880
from a host perspective looking at all

345
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,399
of these different artifacts together to

346
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,880
start building a composite view of what

347
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,040
adversaries look like in my environment

348
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,800
and how that enables me to identify the

349
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,440
behaviors i identified in previous steps

350
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,680
to flag malicious activity that i might

351
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,200
have missed otherwise

352
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,639
so when looking at visibility and

353
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,680
telemetry yes you might get sold on qp

354
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,560
maps and other silliness or whatnot

355
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,920
we don't really need to worry about that

356
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,440
sort of thing really we're talking about

357
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,959
the nuts and bolts of security

358
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,519
operations so diving into your elk

359
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,079
instance and querying things in kibana

360
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,040
or a splunk a qradar a you know pick a

361
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,880
vendor tool it doesn't really matter or

362
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,560
just grepping and searching for things

363
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
on the command line and so forth

364
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,639
identifying what are the data sets that

365
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,079
are available to me and how i can

366
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,079
interact with them in order to extract

367
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,399
the information necessary to align

368
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,079
observations to what i'm looking for

369
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,639
related to adversary operations

370
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,320
if we're looking at this i'd like to

371
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,959
emphasize that there are three pillars

372
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,639
of visibility that we need to emphasize

373
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,040
in security operations uh host

374
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,720
visibility which has been very popular

375
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,240
over the last five years through the

376
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,160
sort of copernican revolution of

377
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,760
endpoint detection and response product

378
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,680
development but also we can't forget

379
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,360
about things like fundamental network

380
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,600
traffic analysis and network visibility

381
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,920
again not just ingress egress but also

382
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,160
identifying lateral movement and

383
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,000
figuring out thorny questions like

384
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,480
hybrid cloud communication and so forth

385
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,720
and then finally on a more legacy basis

386
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
artifact and file analysis which you may

387
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,800
also refer to as antivirus or

388
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,120
anti-malware solutions but being able to

389
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,279
evaluate artifacts related to adversary

390
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,519
operations to determine their function

391
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,240
or if they're malicious or evil or not

392
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,880
ideally we have all three of these

393
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,639
no one's budget is unlimited though so i

394
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,639
realize that many organizations may only

395
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,120
have artifact analysis and maybe they're

396
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,800
doing cismod or something along those

397
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,480
lines or they have a good firewall

398
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,040
solution and maybe some edr product but

399
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,600
aren't really uh doing much at least

400
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,839
much that's sophisticated on the level

401
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,399
of artifact analysis so in those cases

402
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,639
we have gaps and gaps are almost

403
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,880
inevitable to some extent whether we are

404
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,720
strong in certain areas and weak in

405
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,800
others or just completely absent in

406
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,720
certain fashion so one thing that we

407
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,760
need to

408
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,839
do as security professionals is

409
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,079
understand both from an operational

410
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,519
standpoint as well as a hunting

411
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,360
development standpoint of how we can

412
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,199
leverage existing capabilities to make

413
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,240
up for gaps can i use zeek modules to

414
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,480
carve out binaries from traffic streams

415
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,560
if i don't have good host visibility to

416
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,360
perform artifact analysis can i use

417
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,040
endpoint visibility in terms of

418
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,360
operations to make up for my lack of

419
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,279
understanding or visibility into lateral

420
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,639
movement techniques by looking for the

421
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,800
appropriate windows operations or

422
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,480
endpoint artifacts related to things

423
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,240
like user interaction and remote logon

424
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,800
activity again a very complex topic we

425
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,000
don't have that much time to get into

426
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,839
this in very good detail but just

427
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,760
looking for those opportunities to

428
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,360
bridge those gaps where something might

429
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
not be present in our environment to

430
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,440
enrich our visibility to enable us to

431
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,839
ask more complex

432
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,959
questions finally and i think this is

433
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,720
the part of hunting that gets overlooked

434
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,120
the most is having some understanding of

435
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,199
fundamental risk propositions to the

436
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,120
organization we're trying to defend

437
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,680
every entity should have a fairly unique

438
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,440
profile in terms of what threats matter

439
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
and how those threats can actualize

440
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,680
themselves within our environments and

441
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,519
so we want to ask questions of what does

442
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,240
my organization do what is the primary

443
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,560
mission that could be impacted through a

444
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
cyber or you know similar sort of

445
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,399
intrusion and what are the risk

446
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,880
scenarios associated with this activity

447
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,199
this is to focus our efforts so that we

448
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,360
begin asking questions about activity

449
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,279
that is simply important for the

450
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,040
networking question by doing things like

451
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,600
identifying critical assets key network

452
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,399
terrain crown jewel analysis etc to

453
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,000
direct our efforts to the things that

454
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,480
are most significant and most vital to

455
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,720
the organization's availability to

456
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,959
continue to operate so in looking at

457
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,079
that we want to emphasize priorities

458
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,320
because not everything is important if

459
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,600
everything's important then nothing is

460
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,000
important so just figuring out you know

461
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,360
certainly my

462
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,279
domain controllers as part of my

463
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,360
directory instance are simply important

464
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,920
but is my payment processing system my

465
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,079
industrial control devices my medical

466
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,240
devices etc figuring out what are the

467
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,320
sort of keys to the kingdom and

468
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,240
identifying what are the adversary

469
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,560
options towards impacting those assets

470
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,720
and then formulating hunting hypotheses

471
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,519
to

472
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,160
look for what are likely adversary

473
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,120
routes to try to impact degrade disrupt

474
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,519
destroy etc those sorts of assets that

475
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,120
would impact operations at a very

476
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,880
significant level

477
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,079
so what does this look like if we're

478
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,759
putting this all together well we want

479
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,360
to start by certainly identifying

480
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,360
adversaries and their relevant behaviors

481
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,040
what risks these adversaries present to

482
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,959
the organization and then how those

483
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,800
adverse areas can be detected and

484
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,480
putting that all together gets us to a

485
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,639
point where we can now start developing

486
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,959
effective hunting hypotheses based upon

487
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,240
what is

488
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,160
potentially impacting our organization

489
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,240
within the limits of what we can see now

490
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,839
certainly we might identify gaps that

491
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,360
need to be addressed that we can't see

492
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,880
certain things or can't detect certain

493
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,040
things and this becomes the asks that we

494
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,359
have for our leadership of tools that we

495
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,119
need or changes in our networking

496
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,119
environment that are necessary to close

497
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,280
those gaps but in an immediate sense we

498
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,359
now have a basic

499
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,079
blueprint for how to put together

500
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,599
hunting queries in such a fashion that

501
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,679
we can start asking meaningful questions

502
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,720
in a sustainable and repeatable fashion

503
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,400
so what does this look like in practice

504
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,199
you know

505
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,079
you know

506
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,319
not lots of sort of

507
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,760
vague concepts about understand

508
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,320
adversaries and uh put these together in

509
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,000
a testable fashion what does this look

510
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,440
like

511
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,360
oh did that have text yeah be very very

512
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,720
quiet yeah okay anyway uh so let's take

513
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,559
a really simple example business email

514
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,240
compromise this is a threat that i think

515
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,760
often gets overlooked in our community

516
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,200
because it's not technically very

517
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,520
sophisticated but it certainly is very

518
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,880
expensive and costly to many

519
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,960
organizations well let's look at bec and

520
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,000
develop a hypothesis on how bec actors

521
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,200
function so we can postulate that bec

522
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,880
focus adversaries will attempt to

523
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,120
extract financial value so the

524
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,240
organizational value concept uh from the

525
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,840
entity we're defending by trying to

526
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,600
spoof or inject into legitimate

527
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
communication channels and we could

528
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,440
probably identify this activity through

529
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,600
things like email header artifacts or

530
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,520
the lack of proper signatures and dkim

531
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,520
artifacts so here we're putting together

532
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,440
the three components we discussed we

533
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,039
have the value proposition for the

534
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,640
organization they're trying to take

535
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,559
money from us that's a pretty simple one

536
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,039
they're doing so by trying to spoof uh

537
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,039
communications to our organization so

538
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,720
the adversaries behavior what they're

539
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,760
trying to do

540
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,880
and then

541
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,559
how can we find this well maybe if i

542
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,080
start asking questions about email

543
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,160
artifacts and doing some header analysis

544
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,240
i can start identifying differences

545
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,320
between legitimate communication streams

546
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,039
and illegitimate ones to flag suspicious

547
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,200
or fraudulent sorts of behaviors

548
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,520
so here we see the the three components

549
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,320
put together in a systematic way threat

550
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,039
is bec the impact is monetization and

551
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,880
then figure out a way to flag activity

552
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,480
around email observables pretty

553
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,160
straightforward stuff you know that's

554
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,720
not rocket science or you know any other

555
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,080
sort of science maybe a little

556
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,679
scientific like or whatever and trying

557
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,120
to put this together in a systematic

558
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,799
fashion but this is something we could

559
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,440
all usefully and meaningfully do but

560
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,880
things can get certainly much more

561
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,919
complex so for example ransomware the

562
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,440
other threat

563
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,360
often more popular to talk about than

564
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,960
bec because it's technically a little

565
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,440
bit more interesting uh maybe not as

566
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,600
impactful from a monetization standpoint

567
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,520
but definitely something that all of us

568
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,799
care about

569
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,240
so we can look at an example like this

570
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,240
report from the dfir report from a few

571
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,280
months ago

572
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,039
slides were due well i was good i had my

573
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,559
slides in on time so this is from a

574
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,000
couple of months ago

575
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
but you can pretty much take this

576
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
example and replace it with just about

577
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,080
damn near any other ransomware attack

578
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,600
out there and for this to be equally

579
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,799
valid in this case we had a threat actor

580
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,679
that was using iced id as a initial

581
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,200
access well using phishing and then

582
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,919
delivering iced id as an initial ingress

583
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,760
vector into the victim network and then

584
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,240
having a very short time to live of only

585
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,000
about three and a half hours between

586
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,840
initial network compromise and then

587
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,760
delivery of ransomware that's pretty

588
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,640
damn fast and not all that common but

589
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,480
tells us a

590
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,000
sense of timeliness of how we need to

591
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,280
start asking these questions and

592
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,720
potentially systematize how we're

593
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,320
looking for these threats given the

594
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,080
potential that they could

595
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,480
arise or deliver their impact scenarios

596
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,640
in relatively rapid fashion so okay

597
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,080
digging into

598
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,320
these guys how do they operate well

599
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,919
looking at this we see a variety of

600
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,159
things we see cobalt strike ubiquitous

601
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,080
among all e-crime actors and certainly

602
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,400
plenty of apts as well but other things

603
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,280
too ps exec for code execution

604
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,520
abusing wmi for lateral movement and

605
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,559
remote

606
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,640
code execution as well harvesting

607
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,880
credentials and using remote logons and

608
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,720
using harvested credentials to pass on

609
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,280
to ps exec to enable that remote uh

610
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
execution as well as lateral movement

611
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,280
but also using tools like adfind and

612
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,120
bloodhound in order to enumerate active

613
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,520
directory to figure out who are my users

614
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,600
and what are my user groups and so forth

615
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
that are of interest compromising the

616
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,360
domain controller in order to gain whole

617
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,080
of network uh control and then using

618
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,080
things like admin shares and scheduled

619
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,400
tasks in order to seed ransomware

620
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,840
throughout the network and then execute

621
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,480
it in coordinated fashion so a series of

622
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,320
you know fairly complex behaviors but

623
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,640
also fairly common things that we see

624
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,880
a variety of entities from

625
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,840
e-crime actors to apts leveraging as

626
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,919
part of their intrusion operations so if

627
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,679
we can start formulating ways of asking

628
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,760
questions about how these items function

629
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,039
and how they relate to the overall

630
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,360
adversary life cycle or kill chain we

631
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,159
can start developing ways of really

632
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,400
unearthing this sort of activity within

633
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,480
our network and trying to compensate for

634
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,840
things that we may have missed through

635
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,000
automated detections so in looking for

636
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,840
these we want to first identify you know

637
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,280
what are the things that i don't already

638
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,880
detect you know it doesn't make sense to

639
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,080
go hunt for things that i already have

640
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,919
automated detections for because they

641
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,760
should be catching this activity so i

642
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,360
want to focus on things that i'm missing

643
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,080
otherwise but then i want to focus on

644
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,000
the possibilities that are available to

645
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,400
me what data exists and what i can see

646
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,559
so if i don't have very good visibility

647
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,120
into things like how adversaries can

648
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,200
remotely use wmi and so forth because

649
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,880
i'm not logging wmi it doesn't make

650
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,320
sense to try and ask questions about

651
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,240
that so focus on the things that i can

652
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,360
actually do

653
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,720
and then i want to look at the resources

654
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,000
that i have in order to ask these

655
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,760
questions in order to adequately deploy

656
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,080
them do i have the people uh in play

657
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,080
that can ask these questions and figure

658
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,520
out what's going on

659
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,760
so one hunting hypothesis we can develop

660
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,919
is that ransomware affiliates uh you

661
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,600
know already have conceptualized the

662
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,679
threat here will utilize things like

663
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,520
active directory enumeration tools such

664
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,240
as adfine bloodhound etc as part of

665
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,080
their initial discovery phase within the

666
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,000
network so i'm trying to identify things

667
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,760
early in the kill chain that are maybe a

668
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,919
little hard to develop detections for

669
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,400
but that i have visibility around to

670
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,880
look for those instances of uh through

671
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,280
things like uh excessive ad-related

672
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,679
activity through ad logs or through

673
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,600
network detection by identifying

674
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,080
significant amounts of ldap queries uh

675
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,360
which could be done through snort or

676
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,120
cerakata signatures or through zeke

677
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,159
scripting to identify this precursor to

678
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,000
adversary operations looking for the

679
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,440
adversary trying to do things like

680
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,240
identify accounts of interest and

681
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,640
deploying this as a way of detecting

682
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,720
early phase operations before we get

683
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,159
into things like the deployment of

684
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,320
ransomware or if we're talking about you

685
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,760
know a sandworm like actor and the

686
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,120
deployment of a

687
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
wiper or some other destructive payload

688
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,400
so just putting this together in a

689
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,000
systematic fashion

690
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,440
but that's all well and good but the

691
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,280
thing is is that you know it's not just

692
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,440
execute threat hunting magic happens and

693
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,600
then security is achieved we need to do

694
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,240
better so how do we do that well first

695
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,080
off repetitive threat hunting is kind of

696
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,480
wasteful uh yeah we want to certainly do

697
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,760
an iterative process and you can

698
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,440
meaningfully engage and employ a

699
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,600
dedicated hunt team but if we are asking

700
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,279
the same questions over and over again

701
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,440
we have to ask ourselves are we just

702
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,679
applying this sisyphusian-like task of

703
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,520
pushing this boulder up a hill and never

704
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,440
really getting anywhere so we want to

705
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,279
develop hunting as a process that not

706
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,360
just is valuable in and of itself but

707
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,480
that can translate hunts into detections

708
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,640
thus enabling continued security

709
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,360
monitoring so how does that look

710
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,720
well really we're looking for threat

711
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,279
hunting now as a input to detection

712
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,000
engineering a topic that i really enjoy

713
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,159
and in this fashion what we want to do

714
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,320
is first determine what's the baseline

715
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
of our current detection set what is it

716
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,000
that i'm seeing and looking for right

717
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,840
now what is that baseline posture that i

718
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,919
have for my organization and then using

719
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,799
hunting to supplement that baseline to

720
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,400
look for things that are beyond the

721
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,840
scope of what my current automated

722
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,919
detections are looking for asking those

723
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,360
questions that are otherwise hard to

724
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,440
answer and then if i realize that

725
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,640
there's a way that oh you know this

726
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,559
hunting script that i'm putting together

727
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,720
it's a script i can probably automate

728
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
this in some fashion whether as a more

729
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,720
complex analytic or maybe there's a way

730
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,640
that i can piece together some queries

731
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,200
uh in my various tools and to automate

732
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,880
this thus building that into my

733
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,559
detection set after i've established

734
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,039
that it's a valid hunting hypothesis

735
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,279
through evaluation of its results

736
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,799
and fitness to what it is that

737
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,279
adversaries are doing and in this way i

738
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,960
can start developing a

739
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,159
virtuous cycle of hunting filling in the

740
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,159
gaps around my detections and then

741
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,760
successful hunts feeding back into the

742
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,760
detection process so i can start

743
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,360
automating these and improving my

744
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,200
security coverage of the threats that

745
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,360
are available or that are

746
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,559
meaningful or

747
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,480
of interest to me

748
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,919
so this was a really short talk it's

749
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,360
only 25 minutes and i'm a little bit

750
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,520
over time for questions already

751
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,799
the key things is that we want to

752
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,720
understand who our adversaries are so an

753
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,440
intelligence driven way of developing

754
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,520
hunting hypotheses knowing what our

755
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,200
visibility and the capabilities that i

756
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,520
have as a security organization and then

757
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,440
leveraging these items in order to hunt

758
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,120
for threats and improve our security

759
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,600
posture but not stopping there instead

760
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,960
using this

761
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,120
development of a successful hunting

762
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,360
process to then feed into automated

763
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,799
detection development and detection

764
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,279
engineering to continuously improve and

765
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,080
enhance my security posture overall so

766
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,240
again really short stuff

767
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,320
i will be writing up this up in the next

768
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,520
couple of weeks and hopefully have

769
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,960
something published by the end of august

770
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,400
my apologies it's not ready for this

771
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,320
event so if this is a topic of interest

772
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,919
there'll be a deeper dive in written

773
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,000
form later on but to the extent that we

774
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,760
have time right now there are a few

775
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,640
minutes left over for questions

776
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,000
thank you joe

777
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,820
there is some question

778
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:36,400
[Applause]

779
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,840
you have to go to the microphone on the

780
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,300
right side

781
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,419
[Laughter]

782
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,799
thanks joe really appreciate the talk um

783
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,279
any advice or suggestions on hunting in

784
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,440
the cloud the data set is

785
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,080
a bit more challenging operations are

786
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,240
kind of similar across users what do you

787
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,919
have suggestions for for approaching

788
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,360
that my

789
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,440
answer to that is that is an excellent

790
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,200
question and that is actually something

791
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,520
i have my team researching right now um

792
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,720
i don't have good answers at the moment

793
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
because cloud environments it's not just

794
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,400
a question of like hunting in the cloud

795
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,120
it's hunting in azure hunting in aws

796
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,480
hunting in gcp uh so

797
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,159
as far as i can tell right now things

798
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,559
are very solution specific which is one

799
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,559
so certainly there's a division between

800
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,480
things there's hunting in the cloud like

801
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,600
a virtual

802
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,840
private server is a vps it operates just

803
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,000
as any other device it has logs etc you

804
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,520
can query it that way like okay that's

805
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,200
cool the problem is is that when you

806
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,120
start getting beyond just each device in

807
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,840
isolation to how things are

808
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,039
uh

809
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,600
nested or virtualized and hosted or

810
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,399
whatever

811
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,480
co-hosted etc that now you need to start

812
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,320
getting into the actual cloud provider

813
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,279
telemetry and that's part and it's kind

814
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,760
of a pain so that's something that i'm

815
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,760
working on right now i don't have a good

816
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,960
good answer at the moment but i

817
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,880
recognize that that is a pressing

818
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,559
question and something that we need more

819
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,559
advice on so i i feel you on that i just

820
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,679
don't have anything right now i

821
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,480
appreciate it thanks yeah

822
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,399
one more question thank you

823
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,159
good presentation thank you um one of

824
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,520
the things that's always frustrating for

825
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,440
me is when attackers have legitimate

826
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,720
credentials that they've stolen from

827
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,320
somewhere else they sort of go invisible

828
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,919
it becomes a nightmare do you have any

829
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,000
tips and tricks uh for helping track

830
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,240
down people using legitimate credentials

831
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,600
yeah credential abuse i mean that's

832
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,279
common but whether it's grabbing it from

833
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,600
some third party leak or using mini cats

834
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,720
to dump them and then just move

835
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,640
laterally and so forth there are

836
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,320
strategies around this though whether

837
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,559
it's by developing you know you could

838
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,559
apply a machine learning way of looking

839
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,240
at this of developing models of

840
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,080
legitimate user behavior even down to

841
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,600
potentially the account or user group

842
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,960
level to look for anomalous uh behaviors

843
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,640
related to you know like jim is in

844
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,159
accounting why is he

845
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,240
rdping or whatever into the it network

846
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,240
or so forth that's expensive though so

847
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,399
it's not easy to do that other ways of

848
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:57,600
trying to do this that might be a little

849
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,840
cheaper would be looking for things like

850
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,960
uh excessive or egregious one-to-many or

851
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,039
many-to-one relationships for remote

852
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,200
authentication and logon activity so

853
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,799
like why is this one workstation

854
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,320
attempting to use five different

855
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,960
accounts to rdp to another

856
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,120
again that's not still kind of expensive

857
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,320
but a little bit more realistic than

858
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,399
trying to develop an entire model around

859
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,480
user authentication in your environment

860
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,080
and then finally you know looking for

861
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,240
things like abuse of or attempting to

862
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,600
get around things like multi-factor

863
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,360
authentication how did solar winds get

864
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,080
identified because someone was trying to

865
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,799
uh

866
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,039
you know finagle a mfa key

867
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,399
from a user that they were trying to

868
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,840
impersonate so just looking for those

869
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,080
artifacts related to account abuse can

870
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,480
be successful and potentially catch even

871
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,760
really nasty threats that are in motion

872
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,919
cool

873
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,600
there's one more

874
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,080
first rob would be very appreciative of

875
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,960
your slideshow

876
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,840
and then as a follow-on so what happens

877
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,000
if you have one group of users where you

878
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,880
can't do the standardized behavior since

879
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,120
like i have researchers yeah they do a

880
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,000
lot of things at weird times yeah no i i

881
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,240
feel that pain very much so my incident

882
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,919
response experience was largely at los

883
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,840
alamos national laboratory which had a

884
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,279
lot of researchers and a lot of people

885
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,880
doing weird things at weird times which

886
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,440
makes a lot of that behavioral profiling

887
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,200
frustratingly difficult

888
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,679
here things like

889
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,360
and this is where having

890
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,720
good network engineering and

891
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,720
understanding how that applies to user

892
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,640
behavior and what is possible in the

893
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,240
environment can be very successful by

894
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,480
having things like dedicated enclaves

895
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,159
for different user groups and so forth

896
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,520
and then looking for

897
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,000
movement beyond or transitioning beyond

898
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,600
enclaves where those sort of entities

899
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,520
should be operating

900
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,360
however because most networks are flat

901
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,880
that's a hard one to actually do in

902
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,799
practice so moving beyond that we need

903
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,799
to look for opportunities of identifying

904
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,799
post auth or post

905
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,559
credential abuse activities by looking

906
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,080
for things like okay

907
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,440
uh

908
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,000
cindy in the research organization is

909
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,760
really is a night owl and will be doing

910
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,080
weird things at two in the morning

911
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,159
that's fine but looking for where cindy

912
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,919
running something like bloodhound or the

913
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,000
artifacts related to certain types of

914
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,159
very risky behavior is a higher signal

915
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,840
item that something really weird is

916
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,240
going on so here event correlation of

917
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,240
not just relying on the anomalous user

918
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,600
activity but then adding that to a

919
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,360
subsequent event in the attacker life

920
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,960
cycle and correlating those events

921
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,840
become necessary but again that's also

922
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,679
people don't like when i give talks like

923
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,200
this because i give a lot of suggestions

924
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,120
but none of them are easy the problem is

925
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,399
that none of this is easy and we really

926
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,679
need to start understanding that there

927
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,519
isn't you know a one-liner that's going

928
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,880
to solve these issues and looking for

929
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,960
ways of doing better event correlation

930
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,279
to capture these sort of weird edge

931
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,440
cases that you're talking about

932
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,519
thanks yeah

933
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,679
thank you again one more question hi

934
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,360
thank you very much for the

935
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,840
talk um so you talk about

936
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,919
hypotheses and the importance of

937
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,559
hypothesis when you do threatening

938
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,720
i was wondering do you think it's still

939
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,360
important and if you call that

940
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,640
threatening to look at rare values of ip

941
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,320
address on the proxies uh with things

942
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,360
coming up coming up from the edr

943
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,760
i think it's very relevant to do that

944
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,159
like on a weekly basis for example do

945
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,880
you still call that threatening yes i

946
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,480
think so as long as we're structuring it

947
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,159
in a way other than just saying like

948
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,840
weird ip address

949
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,279
of

950
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,480
um enhancing that uh definition by

951
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,679
saying okay

952
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,840
seldom seen or newly observed network

953
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,720
artifact that is associated with either

954
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,720
a asn or something else or whatever that

955
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,640
is suspicious or a geographic region

956
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,320
that is suspicious and then linked to

957
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,240
some activity that i care about because

958
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,840
depending on the network you'll probably

959
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,600
get flooded with lots of ephemeral

960
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,640
connections scans all sorts of things

961
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,480
that can overwhelm just looking for

962
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,720
weird ip but if we start enhancing that

963
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
definition so of trying to formalize

964
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,080
that a bit more

965
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,840
like kind of how i was

966
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,760
referring to in the presentation

967
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,960
that could allow for something more

968
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,039
sustainable and more actionable as well

969
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,880
as something that will be easier for an

970
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,399
analyst to evaluate instead of just

971
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,480
saying hey weird ip go investigate it

972
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
like no no we have an ip address that

973
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,519
was coming from host sailor or

974
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,840
digitalocean or you know pick a provider

975
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,399
that you don't like for some reason and

976
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,600
uh

977
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,559
it

978
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,159
you know attempted an rdp connection or

979
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,080
whatever after hours so some way of

980
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,159
enriching that discussion to provide a

981
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,440
more focused way of answering that

982
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,370
question

983
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,799
[Music]

984
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,720
thank you again i think there is no more

985
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,559
question so thank you joe thanks

986
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,559
everyone

987
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,200
uh

988
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,399
now there is

989
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,799
yeah break for lunch next session will

990
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:45,919
be at the

991
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,120
two o'clock thank you
