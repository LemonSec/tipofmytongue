[Music]

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,120
all right guys we're going to get to the

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,879
last session before lunch started here

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,759
up next is jonathan spring from carnegie

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,199
mellon university

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,279
giving a talk entitled prioritizing

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,320
vulnerability response with a

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,240
stakeholder specific vulnerability

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,600
categorization

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,039
so with that i'll turn it over to

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,320
jonathan and

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,840
all yours sir great

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,439
thank you welcome thanks for coming um

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,719
thanks

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,280
do we have feedback we okay okay

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,040
um i think that this is a good

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,879
vulnerability you know sort of

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,280
management segment so now we'll talk

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,200
about so now you're sure that you have a

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,280
problem how do you triage which ones you

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,879
handle first

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,239
so there'll be a quiz on the next slide

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,839
okay hope you pass the test later

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,760
um

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,879
what we're talking about is something

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,399
that stakeholder specific for

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,680
categorizing

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,120
vulnerabilities

29
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,359
we're trying to improve some status quo

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,199
things bring some stuff together

31
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,799
i think it is plausible to talk about

32
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,799
this as a kind of risk management so i'm

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,799
willing to say that word whereas other

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,720
other things might not be quite fully

35
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,240
encompassing that

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,119
the focus here is on

37
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,560
so there'll be a quiz on the next slide

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,160
okay hope you passed the test later

39
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,080
um

40
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,200
what we're talking about is something

41
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,720
that's stakeholder specific for

42
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,000
categorizing

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,440
vulnerabilities

44
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,680
we're trying to improve some status quo

45
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,520
things bring some stuff together

46
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,120
i think it is plausible to talk about

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,120
this as a kind of risk management so i'm

48
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
willing to say that word whereas other

49
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,959
other things might not be quite fully

50
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,560
encompassing that

51
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,239
the focus here is on what decisions

52
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,160
you're going to make

53
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,239
i'll talk more about what these are

54
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,080
but it's not to say like oh well let's

55
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,280
just talk about what the technical

56
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,959
severity of the vulnerability is and

57
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,040
then as if that is the decision

58
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,519
let's actually have you tell us

59
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,360
what decisions you're going to make and

60
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,480
then help you make them

61
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,599
try to be transparent we're going to try

62
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,560
to own the different people's roles

63
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,080
mean that they need to make different

64
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,280
decisions

65
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,560
so we're going to have to make role

66
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,519
specific recommendations on decisions

67
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,120
and decision making and what information

68
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,239
goes into those decisions

69
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,360
i also have tried to

70
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,519
talk about how we can verify

71
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,720
that ssvc is itself consistent and

72
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,760
useful

73
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,159
so we've proposed some experiment design

74
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,280
and run

75
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,680
you know sort of an empirical case study

76
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,760
on

77
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,280
multiple people

78
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,920
scoring the same vulnerability

79
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,680
and making sure that they get the same

80
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,319
answers and the same decision

81
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,519
right so obviously you want your

82
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,360
analysts to make the same decision as

83
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,000
each other and not have how you triage a

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,519
vole be dependent on the random

85
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,799
assignment to which analyst goes to

86
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,239
um there's been a lot of people who've

87
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,000
helped over the last i don't know four

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,720
years that we've been working on this

89
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,360
um various conference attendees um the

90
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,879
github contributors all of the people at

91
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,879
search cc who are still here and also

92
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,640
have moved on to other companies since

93
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,680
we started

94
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,959
um

95
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,480
the motivation here is this

96
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,439
communication between the risk owners

97
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,358
you know the risk managers right and the

98
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,000
analysts of the vulnerabilities

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,918
the risk managers want to know what's

100
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,840
going to happen and the analysts want to

101
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,680
hear that from them clearly

102
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,440
right and then also the analysts want to

103
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,639
be able to communicate clearly what

104
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,360
they've done and why

105
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,919
so we propose some decision processes

106
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,720
for different stakeholder roles right so

107
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,560
deployer of software

108
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,560
vendor of software you know whoever

109
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,400
produces the software the producer

110
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,000
right and also coordinators have their

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,520
own specific role there's a bunch of

112
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,199
different kinds of coordinators you know

113
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,240
a lot of national asserts are

114
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,080
coordinators they should ask different

115
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
questions than people who deploy

116
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,360
software because they know different

117
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,479
things and they're making different

118
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,320
decisions

119
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,639
we're on version two for this and we're

120
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,639
always trying to improve it i think

121
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,160
yesterday i was going through and trying

122
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,080
to flag the github issues that should be

123
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,120
done to make it a version 2.1

124
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,919
um

125
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,039
we also are trying to provide a process

126
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,080
to you

127
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,600
to adapt this to your situation

128
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,919
and as your sort of vulnerability triage

129
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,479
matures you can be more specific to your

130
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,680
situation

131
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,199
and we try to give you the tools to do

132
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,680
that for yourself

133
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,240
and always go to our github page

134
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,759
you can just go there now if you're

135
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,360
bored and just listen look at that

136
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,400
instead of hearing me talk in the

137
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,759
background that's fine i don't super

138
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,840
care

139
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,720
so here's the decisions right

140
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,800
since we're trying to tell you what

141
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,120
priority to take on a work item and work

142
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,240
item is going to be a little bit

143
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,759
different depending on your stakeholder

144
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,560
role

145
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,479
right basically we're proposing these

146
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,080
the ones for coordinators are a little

147
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,360
bit different

148
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,960
but i've talked to a number of different

149
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,600
people in ciso or manager roles and i

150
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,199
haven't gotten a different answer that

151
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,560
these are the four

152
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,800
tiers of what you can do

153
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,560
right don't worry about this right now

154
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,120
do it during regular business processes

155
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,400
make people work overtime

156
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,479
call the lawyers maybe shut everything

157
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,000
down this is actually really a huge

158
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,680
problem ground the flights i don't know

159
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,960
everything is broken

160
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,319
hopefully the last one is never

161
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,639
something you've had to do

162
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,720
but i think it is a real consideration

163
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,600
this still does not tell you what you

164
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,199
should do about it

165
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,919
you know if you're a software deployer

166
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,199
and

167
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,280
your action is to keep people late

168
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,039
and there is a patch

169
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,560
then probably the right thing to do is

170
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,160
apply the patch

171
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,240
it gets more complicated if it's a zero

172
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,600
day and there's no patch yet but you

173
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,120
have to do something now like what's the

174
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,440
mitigation that you put into place

175
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,880
do you accept the risk do you turn it

176
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,120
off right so i don't tell you exactly

177
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,240
what to do

178
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,599
i do have some advice on how we can

179
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,080
structure that discussion using some of

180
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,759
the decision points that you would use

181
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,400
to make the triage decision cool

182
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,680
um

183
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,599
but just for clarity it's not like a

184
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,199
doubt shout patch at this point because

185
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,319
we're talking about different

186
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,680
stakeholders

187
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,039
coordinators are going to have a

188
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,599
different set of options coordinators

189
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,360
don't patch things they maybe issue

190
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,000
advisories

191
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,479
so these are the three main roles these

192
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,599
track the roles in coordinated

193
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,080
vulnerability disclosure

194
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,840
if you want to read 100 pages about

195
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,759
multi-party cvd we also have that

196
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,280
document but i will not talk about it

197
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,599
today

198
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,280
um

199
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,960
when i say priority of action on a work

200
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,639
item this is where i'm talking about you

201
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,759
know

202
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,080
if you are the supplier you are going to

203
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,919
produce the patch or produce some

204
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,479
mitigation advice

205
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,440
right

206
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,039
if you are the coordinator maybe you're

207
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,159
going to issue an advisory

208
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,800
if you are the deployer hopefully you'll

209
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,440
have a patch to apply

210
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,199
but because i say work item i'm

211
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,879
explicitly not saying cve id

212
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,560
all right if we tie this specifically to

213
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,360
cve ids then things like

214
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
reports about misconfigurations in your

215
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,879
web server that you receive from your

216
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,800
bug bounty program

217
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,879
i can still do ssvc for those because

218
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,400
they are vulnerabilities but they're

219
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,759
never going to get a cve id

220
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,440
right so also flexible to how you're

221
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,240
getting these things in

222
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,879
um i i think that um

223
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,039
you know the cvss impact metrics are

224
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,799
also really credible case and not worst

225
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,360
case um but because ssvc has been

226
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,640
talking about safety for a while i

227
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,240
wanted to make sure that this is clear

228
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,719
that this is built in

229
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,919
unless you can tell me a real case

230
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,360
where actually someone is gonna get hurt

231
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,200
and it's like documented and deployed

232
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,279
and like that's the intended use

233
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,720
i i'm not gonna

234
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,560
go sort of catastrophizing about what

235
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,920
could happen

236
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,720
right

237
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
especially because so for example for

238
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,600
minor or none or this is basically

239
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,600
the iec 61 508 categories

240
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,040
yes i've read that too many times

241
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,080
because i have that number memorized

242
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
you know people get hurt

243
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,160
or nobody's gonna die

244
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,399
people are gonna die

245
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,399
that's a pretty basic separation that i

246
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,240
think that most people can make for if

247
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,480
you're issuing software

248
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,959
there's other examples um

249
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,320
you know i think that

250
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,720
probably maybe if nobody dies but the

251
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,399
entire voting system for a state is

252
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,080
going to collapse that is also a pretty

253
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,120
high

254
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,279
human impact

255
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,040
talk about about those at about the same

256
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,200
level of urgency

257
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,640
um

258
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,480
i don't tend to have a lot of images in

259
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,560
my slides because that's not how i think

260
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,839
i guess and i'm sorry um but you can you

261
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,120
know i

262
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,279
enjoy these comics occasionally um

263
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,720
so we don't want vulnerability

264
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,800
management to become the version of this

265
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,399
where either everything is a one or

266
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,080
everything is a 10 because like the

267
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,000
worst thing you can imagine is always so

268
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,839
much worse than what's actually going on

269
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,680
so

270
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,800
the sort of

271
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,959
scoring function we can technically call

272
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,160
it a function because i can turn this

273
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,600
into binary algebra but we're not going

274
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,279
to go through that it's just logic it's

275
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,240
fine

276
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,959
um you answer some questions and you

277
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,560
sort of decide ahead of time what you're

278
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,240
going to do given the situation

279
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,480
represented by those four questions five

280
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,959
questions whatever

281
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,959
so you might say that

282
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,640
if the state of exploitation of the

283
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,240
vulnerability is that there is a public

284
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,760
proof of concept and it's integrated

285
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,760
into metasploit

286
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,519
and also

287
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,440
that the utility to the adversary is

288
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,000
that it's hard for them to use and also

289
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,160
technical impact and also the public

290
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,920
safety impact

291
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,399
you know and this and this and this and

292
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,560
this then

293
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,959
respond in a scheduled way

294
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,560
like your priority is to do it on the

295
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,720
normal schedule

296
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,320
right so we're just going to have a

297
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,839
number of different combinations of

298
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,720
these possible question answers

299
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,560
metric values decision point values

300
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,160
officially in the documentation their

301
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,680
decision points

302
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,720
right

303
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,160
so how many of these do we end up with

304
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,279
you might think that it's going to be

305
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,800
way too many to try to individually

306
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,200
specify each situation well if it's too

307
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,720
many to individually specify each

308
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,560
situation ask fewer questions

309
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,760
because then you're trying to gather too

310
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,120
much information it's not going to make

311
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,519
a difference

312
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,360
so for example if you're a software

313
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,600
supplier this is the sort of suggested

314
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,440
default tree that we say you might want

315
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,839
to use for version

316
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,279
i don't remember exactly but i think

317
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,720
there's 36 different situations

318
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
so that looks scary but then that's

319
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,240
everything you could possibly do that's

320
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,519
all of the possible combinations

321
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,200
there's a little bit of hiding there and

322
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,800
that i think

323
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,720
one of those might be you know a sort of

324
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,079
ore of a couple of things but

325
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,160
relatively easy analyst has to answer

326
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,440
five questions you get a result

327
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,680
this lets you also see like how many

328
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,600
things are read like

329
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,360
you know for active exploitation which

330
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,560
is the first one there i know you can't

331
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
read it but trust me

332
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,160
you know it makes everything sort of red

333
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,240
towards that bottom of the chart because

334
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,680
if you're a supplier and things are

335
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,440
actively being exploited that's a zero

336
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,839
day

337
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,279
and you're gonna keep people late for

338
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,519
those

339
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,079
basically

340
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,920
also if you don't agree with me just

341
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,240
change the edges if you want to like not

342
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,600
act on a zero day because it's not

343
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,000
important if everything else is low fine

344
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,920
change that orange one to a green one i

345
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,560
don't care it's your risk

346
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,760
right

347
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,839
so this is sort of the

348
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,680
view that the leadership or risk manager

349
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,279
should be able to take right this tree

350
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,959
sort of summarizes the risk posture of

351
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,360
the organization

352
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,720
the analyst doesn't need to keep the

353
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,079
whole tree in mind they just need to

354
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,959
know what questions to ask

355
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,920
so we have different decision points for

356
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,399
different roles

357
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,399
i think that should be sort of obvious

358
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,200
right

359
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,880
vendors know different things than

360
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,959
suppliers

361
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,639
sorry suppliers no different things than

362
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,519
deployers

363
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,720
um

364
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,399
some of them

365
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,240
are going to be shared which the

366
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,279
supplier knows or i i recommend that the

367
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,120
supplier can answer

368
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,560
these four or five questions

369
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,040
the deployer can answer these and are

370
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,360
useful to answer these

371
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,720
i think that maybe this actually is a

372
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,160
little bit too many and i'm going to try

373
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,760
to get rid of one of them in a in the

374
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,680
version 2.1 release but we're going to

375
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,839
see how that

376
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,040
goes you might notice that these are the

377
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,360
same

378
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,639
these two things are very good

379
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,519
candidates for the supplier to put into

380
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,000
their security advisory because they can

381
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,600
tell all of the people who deploy the

382
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,320
system what the answer is

383
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,279
the answer won't change

384
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,000
some of these things are not the same

385
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,680
it seems pretty obvious that the person

386
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,600
who makes the software can't know how

387
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,360
you're going to deploy it they won't

388
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,120
know what the exposure of the system is

389
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,920
to the internet

390
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,399
only the deployer knows that so we will

391
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,880
not ask the supplier to know that

392
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,040
however it probably matters a lot to how

393
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,720
quickly you need to patch a piece of

394
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,800
software if it's exposed and open to the

395
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,480
internet so we'll have the deployer ask

396
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
that

397
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,760
some of these things are related right

398
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,320
one of the pieces of feedback from

399
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,040
i think it was vmware was

400
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,399
that they don't know that much about how

401
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,160
their software is deployed

402
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,399
right

403
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,240
i mean vmware in particular knows that

404
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,360
it's not supposed to be used for

405
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,560
anything that's like going to kill

406
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,279
people but um so public safety impact

407
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,399
only really has

408
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,120
people will die people will not die

409
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,920
right

410
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,519
the situated safety impact you might

411
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,040
know a little bit more about like well

412
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,160
this plc is deployed in the robotic arm

413
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,439
that can reach people

414
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,880
whereas the other ones are not

415
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,240
if you are growing bored of listening to

416
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,160
me describe these things to you and you

417
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,399
want to move at your own pace you can go

418
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,880
look at this page here i will also

419
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,880
continue to talk through things

420
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,920
choose your own adventure

421
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,680
so this is the full definition for one

422
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,360
of the decision points this one in

423
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,079
particular is the state of exploitation

424
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,759
all right so the first sentence tries to

425
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,519
give you like a pretty concise summary

426
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,959
of what we're trying to talk about with

427
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,160
this one

428
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,880
presentative exploitation

429
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,360
then we try to give some context

430
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,959
some stuff that might be interesting

431
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,839
some stuff that might be involved

432
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,759
right

433
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,440
but really the key thing is that the

434
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,720
analyst is going to have to decide

435
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,800
between these three states of affairs

436
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,680
there's

437
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,560
no clear evidence of exploitation there

438
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,639
is a public proof of concept or it's

439
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,560
actively being exploited you might then

440
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,239
ask what do those mean well

441
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,480
some of them are relatively simple

442
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,880
answers

443
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,959
i think the right default for this is

444
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,639
you know i've looked in all the regular

445
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,800
places for active exploitation like my

446
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,480
ids alerts are not triggering and i have

447
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,639
signatures installed it's not on the no

448
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,480
exploited vulnerabilities list

449
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,839
right i pay for a threat intelligence

450
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,600
fee and it's not on there okay i've

451
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,440
looked in those three places it's not

452
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,120
active

453
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,800
poc also

454
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,240
decidable right have you looked in the

455
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,519
right places

456
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,800
maybe you're just going to decide that

457
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,639
looking on the underground markets isn't

458
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,000
something you're willing to pay for it

459
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,360
doesn't matter so you've just done the

460
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,040
other two

461
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,600
metasploit next db are public they tag

462
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,680
things with cve ids you can search those

463
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,600
repositories you know we have code

464
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,800
available that does that you can

465
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,720
automate that part of this

466
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,480
there might be some things that are cwe

467
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,759
related that maybe you're never going to

468
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,520
see public pocs like that because it's

469
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,199
just configure the squid proxy to do a

470
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,039
certain thing for a non-path attacker

471
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,160
whatever fine there's a couple of

472
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,640
different ways you can get to poc

473
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,679
but you can check that these have

474
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,880
happened and if they haven't then you

475
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,360
pick none

476
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,039
so there's no default for this one

477
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,119
there's do the work do the checking you

478
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,639
didn't find anything call it none

479
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,799
you can always answer this

480
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,679
so the the deployer tree looks a little

481
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,200
bit scarier i had to shrink that down to

482
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,640
whatever two-point font to get down on

483
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,280
the slide maybe four point but it fits

484
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,240
um

485
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,720
this looks scary right

486
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,640
but of course it's easy to automate just

487
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,360
a

488
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,400
a and b and c and d it's just a lookup

489
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,280
table

490
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,240
very simple four lines of code right

491
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,679
automating

492
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,600
the human has decided that these are the

493
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,080
four answers therefore scheduled super

494
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,520
easy

495
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,360
the cognitive processing task of

496
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,559
figuring out what the answer to

497
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,559
technical severity is is a little bit

498
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,679
harder

499
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:06,400
right

500
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,600
but we've designed this to try to

501
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,200
minimize this human effort because the

502
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,720
humans are going to have to do some of

503
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,799
it

504
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,480
so some of these are reusable across

505
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,919
device

506
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,240
and also i think exposure particularly

507
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,919
is actually probably

508
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,160
viably the result of an ss scan

509
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,000
like define some different scan points

510
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,919
for your different scanners you know if

511
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,520
it responds to these different scans

512
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,080
then it's open if it doesn't respond to

513
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,440
these but responds to those it's

514
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,640
controlled

515
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,520
right

516
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
it'll be plausible to automate that and

517
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,440
then it's an asset management thing you

518
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,240
don't have to do it for each

519
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,440
vulnerability

520
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,200
it's fine

521
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,360
the whole process of setting up the tree

522
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,440
is also reusable

523
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,480
all right so you don't have to do this

524
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,919
every time

525
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:50,960
um

526
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,400
and as i sort of mentioned i think some

527
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,840
of these are actually automatable

528
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,120
conveniently you know state of

529
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,400
exploitation is probably the one that

530
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,480
you want to update the most often

531
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,919
you might want to update that every day

532
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,240
um but checking the github repositories

533
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,559
for the exploit db and metasploit and

534
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,799
you know other you know github scans and

535
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,200
whatever checking the kev list those are

536
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,880
all automatable

537
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,240
so the thing that needs to change the

538
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,480
most often is also conveniently the

539
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,679
thing that's easiest to automate

540
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,360
okay we will now go through a scoring

541
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,840
example

542
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,160
so here's a rockwell vol

543
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,240
to be honest uh i haven't wanted to

544
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,440
update the

545
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,720
example because i want to try to be

546
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,559
consistent so this is two years old now

547
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,600
but

548
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,760
this had a base score of 9.8 people were

549
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,960
sort of cranky about that because it

550
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,240
doesn't really make sense that this is

551
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,600
that important

552
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,440
um but

553
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,880
here we are

554
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,280
so how do we score this

555
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,919
well it is

556
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,440
a remote code execution right

557
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,559
so you're going to get total control

558
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,760
technical impact is total

559
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,080
i think that there's a gloss you know uh

560
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,080
possibly of like if cvss version three

561
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,000
scope is unchanged and c is high and i

562
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,640
is high then total

563
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,200
maybe i think that's not quite right

564
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,880
at least the scope thing makes it a

565
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,120
little bit messy but fine

566
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,360
well is this one currently being

567
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,240
exploited last time i checked no

568
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,159
which was recently but things could have

569
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,120
changed but normally something has a

570
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,200
public proof of concept within two or

571
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,600
three days if it's gonna get one

572
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,360
this is now two years old the chances

573
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,679
that this changes day on day is

574
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,159
pretty low

575
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,559
so this one is um utility is this

576
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,919
concept of how useful it is to the

577
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,400
adversary to make this easier to see in

578
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,640
the tree we sort of compress this as

579
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,440
like

580
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,760
either it's very good for them but hard

581
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,720
to do

582
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,039
or it's very easy for them to do but it

583
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,559
doesn't matter very much we've given

584
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,120
those the same label of efficient

585
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,760
right we could redo the trees to make

586
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,840
automatable and value density explicit

587
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,360
and just make sure that

588
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,000
um whenever those two you know yes or

589
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,039
diffuse

590
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,840
and no and concentrated we can make sure

591
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,840
that those always have the same answer

592
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,600
um but it's easier to manage that

593
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,760
cognitive load if you condense them here

594
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,960
so we'll just go through those two

595
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,120
questions like the analyst would do

596
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,799
so first question the analyst would ask

597
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,760
is is it automatable

598
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,440
we frame this in the kill chain way

599
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,760
so this one really has four subparts can

600
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,000
i automate step one reconnaissance can i

601
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,520
automate step two right

602
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,720
by the way if there's remote code

603
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,200
execution possible it almost certainly

604
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,559
is automatable

605
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,919
is that sort of what remote code

606
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,679
execution means unauthenticated remote

607
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,880
code execution i guess right

608
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,679
how important is this thing to the

609
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,600
attacker

610
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,880
like are they going to really care about

611
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,320
it because they get a lot of value out

612
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,080
of it or do they need to compromise a

613
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,520
lot of them and turn them into a botnet

614
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,440
to resell 100 000 bots at a time for it

615
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,919
to be worth their time

616
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,559
this one is the second one they will

617
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,000
still do that

618
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,840
but it's not like compromising an active

619
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,799
directory server right

620
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,400
okay so yes but diffuse so we're gonna

621
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,039
collapse that to efficient

622
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,600
this could change obviously i said that

623
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,360
the you know supplier doesn't know the

624
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,600
exposure but this is supposed to be uh

625
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,799
you know factory talk thing it's

626
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,240
supposed to be at least not open to the

627
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,120
internet

628
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,640
you could check showdown

629
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,919
see how many of them are open to the

630
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,440
internet and those people should set

631
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,880
this to open until they fix that and

632
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,640
then they can change it

633
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,559
but you know smaller control depending

634
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,039
on exactly how you've deployed your ics

635
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,360
network right

636
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,120
can people die from this

637
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,880
it's the diagnostics page it shouldn't

638
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,440
kill anybody

639
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,400
i'm sure that you could invent a

640
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,320
situation in which it killed people i

641
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,000
don't care if you can invent that show

642
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
it to me deployed on the factory floor

643
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,760
and then we'll talk

644
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,200
to those people who deployed it that way

645
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,919
okay is your plant gonna shut down

646
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,600
because the diagnostics page has a

647
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,679
remote code execution vulnerability in

648
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,600
it even if it's exploited like assuming

649
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,840
they get they get to it right

650
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,679
i hope not

651
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,600
you might lose visibility into stuff

652
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,840
that's going

653
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840
but it shouldn't be able to directly

654
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,799
control

655
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,559
the systems that are reporting to it it

656
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,000
should be like sort of a write-only

657
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,880
diagnostics page right

658
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,039
okay so different

659
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,200
stakeholders will use different pieces

660
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,400
of that information

661
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,640
but here's the summary of the seven

662
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,480
questions we just went through

663
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,440
i think

664
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,760
maybe six or seven minutes

665
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,080
you know i knew some of the answers so

666
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,159
it was a little bit faster than normal

667
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,520
but i think an analyst should be able to

668
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,120
answer those questions in less than 20

669
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,039
minutes

670
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,960
because we can give them advice on where

671
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,080
to look

672
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,320
right we can structure that question

673
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,400
answering process because the questions

674
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,840
are sort of small and they have

675
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,080
relatively coarse answers you don't have

676
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,600
to get into excessive amounts of detail

677
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,159
that don't matter

678
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,600
based on the default trees that we

679
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,279
recommend you know

680
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,880
the deployer would actually defer on

681
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,600
this

682
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,720
compare that to the base score of 9.8

683
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,640
i don't think you would get that 9.8

684
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,760
down to a low using the environmental

685
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,879
and temporal metrics

686
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,279
rockwell should definitely produce a

687
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,279
patch

688
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,240
which they obviously did so it seems

689
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,720
like we all agree there

690
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,159
just so you can see how sort of this

691
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,679
flows through the supplier tree i've

692
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,360
highlighted the answers there and then i

693
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,720
get to the end

694
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,559
you know we can also bring back the you

695
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,679
know

696
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:00,480
none

697
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,400
and efficient and partial and minimal

698
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,880
equals scheduled

699
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,640
right this is sort of just a logical

700
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,360
combination of those four answers

701
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,960
to get you to the edge of the tree

702
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,840
cool that's it

703
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,120
i mean there's obviously lots of details

704
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,880
on how you implement this

705
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,000
but that's it right that's all you would

706
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,400
need to really know

707
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,799
there's 70 more pages of documentation

708
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,720
if you want to get into the details

709
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,679
if you think that we've forgotten

710
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,600
something file an issue on the github

711
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,919
and we will answer it better file an

712
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,840
issue and then a pull request and fix it

713
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,840
yourself

714
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,159
right um we've gotten a bunch of people

715
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,840
to give us different public comments if

716
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,279
you don't want to do it on github i will

717
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,200
take emails and fix it myself and then

718
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,400
not tell anyone who told me that

719
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
happened earlier this week

720
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,600
um

721
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,279
i want to do more studies about making

722
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,120
sure that this works especially across

723
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,120
sort of non-us-centric

724
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,000
or maybe non-english as a first language

725
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,320
people reading the spec and the

726
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,080
expectations and getting the same

727
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,840
answers so if you'd like to volunteer

728
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,320
let me know

729
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,480
this is everything i've told you

730
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,320
right so i think that stakeholder

731
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,400
specific thing i take very seriously

732
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,840
right like different stakeholders are

733
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,279
going to have different

734
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,440
importance right different

735
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,799
things that they bring to the table

736
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,640
different requirements

737
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,320
you know um the last thing i'll say is

738
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,520
that i think

739
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,600
you know one

740
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,679
legitimate but perhaps unfortunate

741
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,279
decision process

742
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,520
is my national terts

743
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,159
my national cert told me to

744
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,120
we can also represent that in ssvc

745
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,720
question one did your national cert tell

746
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,039
you to yes patch it no don't

747
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,320
but then you might want to know how your

748
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,960
national cert came to that decision

749
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,640
so that if you do want to start to

750
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
mature your process you can start to

751
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,080
include some of your own information

752
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,480
into it

753
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,120
there will also be a boff at five

754
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,039
please come talk to us and complain or

755
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,679
tell us we're great i would like the

756
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,400
second but i really need the first more

757
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,480
uh as a reward for questions the best

758
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,159
question can have a signed copy of this

759
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,159
book

760
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,960
i'll move it up here for you to all see

761
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,279
that there you go

762
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,399
uh yeah

763
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,440
so

764
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,480
i'm

765
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,919
almost exactly where i wanted to be to

766
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,799
leave nine minutes for questions

767
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,799
so

768
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,159
if no one asks a question then no one

769
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,720
gets the book

770
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,678
thanks

771
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,600
not really looking for the book

772
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,320
also it's appreciated uh as an incentive

773
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,279
but um i was wondering

774
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,600
when you reference um

775
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,559
a cv so you actually bind the ssvc score

776
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,559
um or metrics to

777
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,480
any kind of

778
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,679
id

779
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,000
have you considered using

780
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,159
the

781
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,640
vrdx format that is developed at a first

782
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,399
physique

783
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,360
uh

784
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,679
yes in the sense that i'm agnostic

785
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,399
or like when i so by saying work item it

786
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,840
can be whatever sort of id you want to

787
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
bind it to

788
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,440
i think that there are different use

789
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,600
cases for different ones

790
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,279
so i don't want to i certainly don't

791
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,159
want to be tied to using just one

792
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,080
because not everything is going to fall

793
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,840
under one identifier system i don't

794
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,600
think unless you have the one ring to

795
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,679
rule them all

796
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,399
no i don't

797
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,679
so yeah i think that that's also a good

798
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,320
one to use i don't see any reason why

799
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,919
you wouldn't be able to bind it to a

800
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,559
vrdx

801
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,720
um

802
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,279
cve ids you know i sort of alluded to

803
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,480
this when i said that there are certain

804
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,919
things that the supplier and the

805
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,320
deployer could profitably communicate to

806
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,000
each other right so like state of

807
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,279
exploitation

808
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,360
i think makes sense to bind to a cve id

809
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,799
as well as other things

810
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,440
um but like exposure

811
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,960
i don't think makes sense to bind so

812
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,760
much to a cveid publicly like in the nvd

813
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,880
because it's going to change per

814
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,240
deployment

815
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,440
so different uh decision points i would

816
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,559
bind differently i think

817
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,159
my second question would be are there

818
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,799
already tools available to do that

819
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,120
on scale so um

820
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,640
if i want to

821
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,440
so

822
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,679
you you show the growth a great demo

823
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:38,720
tool

824
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,760
but if i want to do that in practice

825
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,640
for

826
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,799
all of these security advisories that

827
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,919
that come in um is there a tool i can do

828
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,320
that with um where also then

829
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,399
automatically can update the the exploit

830
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,559
notification or the exploit decision

831
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,960
um so there's json

832
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,840
or

833
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,399
ssvc

834
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,600
the

835
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,039
demo insert calculator will output json

836
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,960
for you

837
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,840
will csaf take in ssvc json

838
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,240
probably not at that stage um but we can

839
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,640
discuss that for 2.1 okay

840
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,720
yeah go ahead

841
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,399
yeah so

842
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,720
based on what you scored the retirement

843
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,600
was cvss so i'm assuming that's based on

844
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,360
what comes out from the vendor

845
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,480
uh sorry which part of well you've

846
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,399
talked like you're showing the cvss 9.8

847
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,559
like so i'm just i'm assuming that's

848
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,320
based on the vendor

849
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,120
version of the cvss score and not based

850
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,600
off of if you go through the whole

851
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,519
process and actually

852
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,679
figure it out how it's really

853
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:00,880
the score

854
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,799
as it's set up in your own organization

855
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,159
correct uh so if you mean is it the base

856
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,000
score and not the base environmental

857
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,559
temporal score then the 9.8 is the base

858
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,679
score yeah um the temporal score could

859
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,679
potentially be used to represent the

860
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,039
fact that there's no exploitation that

861
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,640
would bring it down i don't have the

862
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,080
equation memorized but to something like

863
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,760
an eight point something

864
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,679
and then the environmental metrics you

865
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,760
could potentially

866
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,000
say that the sort of security

867
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,600
requirements are medium but that will

868
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,880
keep the score flat

869
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,799
it's security requirements high in

870
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,320
version three that will increase the

871
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,679
score

872
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,159
and if you change the

873
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,880
you know imp modified impact

874
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,679
you know modified impact metrics for cia

875
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,640
that won't really change the score in

876
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,799
particular because you get total control

877
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,960
it's an rce right the environmental

878
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,200
thing won't help you there so i think

879
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,120
that you could use the

880
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,640
base environmental temporal score to

881
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,720
change it from a 9.8 to maybe an eight

882
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,919
or something but that's still a high

883
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,000
so i guess mainly it's

884
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,120
i'm just thinking about for any time you

885
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,600
would be using this it's like if you

886
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,840
went through

887
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,480
whatever process you did for whatever

888
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,960
irregardless of the cbe and you said

889
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,360
okay for the cvss score as i have it

890
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,679
implemented here i have it

891
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:24,799
what

892
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:25,919
how would you

893
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,480
recommend or if we used

894
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,919
ssvc how would we

895
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,640
correlate coordinate those two

896
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,960
scores to help us

897
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,559
yeah so um

898
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,039
i mean one thing you need is to say what

899
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,039
decisions you make based on what cvss

900
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,640
scores right

901
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,919
you could do that and then probably

902
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:46,960
would be okay

903
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,399
um i think that

904
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,719
uh

905
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,600
you know there's some things in

906
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,360
ssvc version two that are not

907
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,720
representable in cvss v3

908
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,519
like mission or safety impact just not

909
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,960
not accessible

910
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,679
um exposure is

911
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,360
maybe representable in that you could

912
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,880
change the attack vector but that's not

913
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,320
in the environmental metrics you're not

914
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,919
really supposed to be allowed to touch

915
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:12,960
that

916
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,120
as a deployer

917
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,880
right so there's there are things that

918
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,640
cvss sort of doesn't recommend you're

919
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,240
able to change

920
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,039
that are clearly in the control of the

921
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,279
deployer for ssvc

922
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,880
right and there are some things in ssvc

923
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,720
that just aren't represented

924
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,080
in cvss v3 um but i think that if your

925
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,960
question is like

926
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,760
okay so i'm already using cvss at least

927
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,919
according to the spec exactly and i'm

928
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,360
actually doing environmental and

929
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,000
temporal scores like good

930
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,519
that's definitely better than just using

931
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,720
the base score

932
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,760
and

933
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,200
you know just using the base score is

934
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,519
explicitly forbidden so

935
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,640
um

936
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,519
but

937
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,200
people still do it all the time

938
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,000
right

939
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,320
thanks

940
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,159
so

941
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,640
you you walked us through

942
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,080
one of the examples during your

943
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,440
presentation

944
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,600
um but then if you if you go through

945
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,839
this within an organization you you

946
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,839
really want to record all of your

947
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,679
decisions and the evidence that you had

948
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,918
for these decisions do you have do you

949
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,679
envision any tools that would support

950
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,599
that

951
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,119
depends on what form the evidence needs

952
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,520
to take you know if it's a url the json

953
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,599
can you know encode a url on a time

954
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,760
stamp use the wayback machine whatever

955
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,879
um

956
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,399
for things like automatable it's a bit

957
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,040
harder because it's sort of an argument

958
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,719
right there is

959
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,480
um a fair amount of work talking about

960
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,399
argumentation and like what makes a good

961
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,119
argument even in security specifically

962
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:41,440
um

963
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,800
[Music]

964
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,320
some of the very challenging ones to

965
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,079
provide evidence for are still going to

966
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,320
be sort of intelligence analysis or

967
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,719
human right it's not an nlp task that i

968
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,000
expect a machine learning thing to be

969
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,399
able to pick up next year and that'll

970
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,719
have to be to some extent

971
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,960
just exposed as text for us to argue

972
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,000
about

973
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,480
um for something that's complicated

974
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,720
for when it's system exposure

975
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,640
you know i think that probably the scan

976
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,400
results should be attached to your

977
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,520
internal documentation with a time stamp

978
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,040
and you know we need to make space for

979
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,240
that but i think that's relatively

980
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,640
straightforward is that your question

981
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,280
yeah it didn't mean that it would be it

982
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,200
was going to be fully automated decision

983
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,240
but

984
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,839
basically if you're if you're going

985
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,760
through this

986
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,200
there's a human

987
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,079
looking at this and and making decisions

988
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,280
um and you need to record that yes

989
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,760
um and i would say that also

990
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
one of the things that ought to be done

991
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,119
is as long as you have at least two

992
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,960
analysts

993
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,040
you should randomly assign like 10

994
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,599
of your vols to both of them

995
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,960
and make sure that they get the same

996
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,000
answer

997
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,240
and if they don't i think it's probably

998
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,839
a problem with the spec and not a

999
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,760
problem with the analysts like i want to

1000
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,040
know about it not that you should

1001
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,960
discipline the analysts but that's how

1002
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,160
we're going to keep making sure that

1003
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,079
everything works properly is if we

1004
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,160
document the decisions and occasionally

1005
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,920
or comparing them for the same answers

1006
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,040
and making sure we're getting the same

1007
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,040
humans getting the humans to give us the

1008
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,599
same answer

1009
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,640
yeah thanks

1010
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,040
oh also in case this isn't obvious

1011
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,880
people are really using this in practice

1012
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,320
and it is working for people this is

1013
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,839
based on a bunch of refinement that

1014
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,000
we've gotten from stuff operations you

1015
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,599
know in practice

1016
