already sixth day

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,039
uh in uh placing everything in your

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,120
heads and trying to understand the local

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,440
culture and then being awake and

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,800
understanding that the coffee here is

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,800
not as strong as italian one

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,760
so thank you very very much for coming

30
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,760
when i was preparing presentation

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,159
i had no clue which day it's gonna be

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,320
and for myself

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,760
as a practitioner it takes a lot of

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,320
mental energy to keep focused and still

35
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,960
grab something from the presentations

36
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,439
i understand your situation as well so

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,439
i'll try to

38
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,200
balance somehow the knowledge and

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,119
highlight uh some things but i think

40
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,799
it's more relevant for the for the

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,600
for you uh so about me

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,680
and villus from vilnius

43
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,920
for last many years

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,759
professionally i'm

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,840
practicing design thinking to build cset

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,479
sock type of organizations

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,560
because the

48
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,560
conference is first that means for

49
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,880
incident response teams so the title i

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,119
chose not to establish but to modernize

51
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,240
because

52
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,200
i know that at least some of the people

53
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,079
mentioned for example a person from

54
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,640
jersey is mentioning that we are

55
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,520
kind of modernizing from almost nothing

56
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,598
into something great

57
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,080
so please think then uh this

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,319
modernization is about from where you

59
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,480
are where you're gonna go

60
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,720
so

61
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,800
there's so many of you uh

62
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
so

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,959
some of you are from sea set socks ice

64
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,200
axe psets so ivy any managers

65
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,120
managers meaning having at least one

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,840
subordinate okay a few

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,519
good i think the primary messages are

68
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,200
for you

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,720
avia incident handlers

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,680
okay i'm gonna mention some words about

71
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,120
what you should request to change in

72
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,640
your environments for your life to be

73
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,879
easier

74
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,760
other roles in sad socks pieces

75
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,120
okay some people then avia consultants

76
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,480
who assist

77
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,120
said to be better

78
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,239
okay

79
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,959
and other vendors who provide automation

80
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,080
for socks to work better

81
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,360
okay maybe maybe they are okay good and

82
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,519
then some others good

83
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,400
so

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,720
what i'm gonna talk it's

85
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,080
not theory

86
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,000
because i believe it should work so but

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,720
because of what myself with my

88
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,200
colleagues were doing around the world

89
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,599
and trying to

90
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,000
end up with the places

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,640
where cert sock teams when you look at

92
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,080
their face

93
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,560
they're shining their eyes are

94
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,239
shining

95
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,480
that how i read that

96
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,440
that's

97
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,760
outer state somebody before the this

98
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,519
morning was asked so how do we know that

99
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,519
the set is good that's my answer my

100
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,920
personal village answer is if i meet the

101
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,879
person whose eyes are shining and he is

102
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,120
passionate that means he understands and

103
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,840
he feels comfort comfortable in the

104
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,000
setup that means he understands what he

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,159
is doing in the organization and he

106
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,439
feels the purpose of what he is doing

107
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,120
and we're going to talk what actually it

108
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,840
means

109
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,799
so

110
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,280
why i chose to submit a talk

111
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,880
i haven't heard

112
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,720
this being expressed anywhere else maybe

113
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,560
there's some papers talking about it but

114
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,320
i myself i've never seen i try to read

115
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,479
all the materials new materials about

116
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,720
design thinking in incident response

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,360
teams but i feel that

118
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,800
all the incident response teams are

119
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,600
increasingly expected to work as

120
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,880
professional and effective organizations

121
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,800
what does it mean

122
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,199
that means that you can not only do the

123
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,440
work what you're supposed to do but you

124
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,360
are supposed to engineer into better

125
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,199
yourself in the future

126
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,520
so not only to do all the activities

127
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,880
what i expected from all the

128
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,520
stakeholders and resource stressful etc

129
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,800
but you need to become better because

130
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,039
how i see one is

131
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,600
teams get bigger budgets

132
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,600
or they grow more and if you grow more

133
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,680
than 15 people then suddenly you need to

134
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,440
introduce the management practices and

135
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,720
etc

136
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,280
or because of legislation big a mandate

137
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,639
mandate means responsibility authority

138
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,240
for your team

139
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,440
and that comes all national

140
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,400
legislation

141
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,080
national service security frameworks et

142
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,680
cetera et cetera so from incident

143
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,080
responders suddenly it requires to be

144
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,759
very professional

145
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,280
government or national team

146
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,120
or sectoral one

147
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,560
so it's only

148
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,000
i think 20 minutes left so i cannot

149
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,759
ensure that all of you get what's

150
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,080
written but at least when i was putting

151
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,360
the message

152
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,960
i was hoping that is at least gonna

153
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,560
touch on one of the points what might be

154
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,880
interesting for you or to inspire you

155
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,120
because i wish i could

156
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,880
export and dump

157
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,039
all my knowledge and thinking into

158
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,720
something but it's kind of tacit

159
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,960
knowledge which cannot be written

160
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,960
unfortunately

161
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,120
so

162
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,319
there is a such publication by nisa

163
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,360
has anyone seen it

164
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,880
so

165
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,319
it was created by

166
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,600
my team

167
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,880
then we were tasked to create a

168
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,160
publication we're thinking okay but

169
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,600
there's so many publications already

170
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,280
done so what's missing so my colleague

171
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,240
romaldas said actually i've never seen

172
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,280
something result driven approach a lot

173
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,880
of books which say you know you should

174
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,240
do that you should think about this

175
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,360
service but what exactly i should

176
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
have in order to move forward in the

177
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,319
process

178
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,440
so the the picture here is um

179
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,199
from the draft because then it's

180
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,280
beautified and it's not so clear and

181
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,880
there are more colors and confusing in

182
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,240
the book itself but this is from the

183
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,039
draft what we submitted as outcome

184
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,039
so what's important if we say that uh so

185
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,080
the life cycle how we identified is

186
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,120
that it's

187
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,199
usually we are probably in operations

188
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,840
and then we think about how to improve

189
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,360
then we design that improvement

190
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,280
implement that improvement and again

191
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,199
organizing operations

192
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,039
we don't touch

193
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,680
beginning phase so for those who were in

194
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,960
search cc

195
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,120
presentation on sectoral sets

196
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,360
you remember there are six steps

197
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,199
how to map here

198
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,880
step one to four this part

199
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,880
step five which was planning and

200
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,599
implementation is design implementation

201
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,680
so these two stages

202
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,440
and if you see there's a lot of a lot of

203
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,080
artifacts focusing on metaphor and what

204
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,960
what touched justin's um

205
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,639
sentence was saying you know on this

206
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,160
path a lot of teams rail off of the

207
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,840
rails or or

208
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,080
get confused so that's the essence of

209
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,280
this work so

210
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,720
what does it mean

211
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,560
currently if you don't do anything just

212
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,639
operate then

213
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,800
you operate and measure what is the

214
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,680
outcome but you do something and

215
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,360
you think about end of a year probably

216
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360
you need to look at annual operation

217
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,240
performance review so how much value we

218
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,639
created then you talk around for your

219
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,400
stakeholders

220
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
are you matching the expectations and

221
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,479
when you discuss what is the budget is

222
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,400
it increasing or decreasing

223
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,479
and uh if it's increasing what other

224
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,319
initiatives you can initiate and

225
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,080
move forward towards improvement

226
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,319
planning so list of chosen initiatives

227
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,400
for improvement so out of big lists

228
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,319
which were approved the budget and the

229
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,640
resources what you have in line in doing

230
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,559
something for example maybe you're very

231
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,120
tiny cert or sock

232
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,360
you create value but it's not structured

233
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,559
well

234
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,570
so maybe the

235
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,880
[Music]

236
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,080
improvement is to clarify the mandate

237
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,480
what we do and what we do not do because

238
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,120
if we say that we do something

239
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,880
mentally we mean that we don't do

240
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,920
anything else right if we leave it we do

241
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,240
this and everything else that's getting

242
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,920
confusing then

243
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,839
lower chance of shining eyes

244
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,920
so in the team it has to be

245
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,200
quite clear uh thing so when we have

246
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,720
improvement plan

247
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,519
then we have to get the improvement into

248
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,680
the design and there

249
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,360
there has to be it can be as a separate

250
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,680
documents could be one document will see

251
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,399
that kind of chapters or answers so what

252
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,640
you need to think about modernism in the

253
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
modernization or improvement you need to

254
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,040
answer how this change

255
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,480
gonna

256
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,040
impact my mandate

257
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,839
what i have currently for my

258
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,360
organization what services what i

259
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,320
deliver

260
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,839
how they're going to be changed are we

261
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,240
emerging are we increasing our reducing

262
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
uh what exactly the services out of

263
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,080
these services naturally the changes

264
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,839
have to cascade down to processes and

265
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,440
workflows

266
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,480
down to

267
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,480
how it affects my organization

268
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,320
is it separate division for particular

269
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,560
is it another person how we organize

270
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,920
ourselves

271
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,080
skills and training structure

272
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,680
how we're going to acquire required

273
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,560
skills skills of knowledge and skills of

274
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,040
needed of operation of the processes

275
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,360
then facilities where these extra people

276
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,360
gonna sit do we need extra doors to lock

277
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,040
if we on board

278
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,959
more sensitive information etc and then

279
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,680
only then it goes the technology

280
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,440
for the change what do you want to do

281
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
are we using the same technology for

282
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,600
example during this conference i talked

283
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,000
the teams which use the hive but do not

284
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,680
have ticketing system for coordination

285
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,560
work

286
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,320
so then it's possible to use open source

287
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,440
like rtrr but or it's possible to use

288
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,760
otrs what was in the corner

289
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,680
and hopefully many of you have talked to

290
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,519
them and saw

291
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,360
how it can be used

292
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,360
practically

293
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,320
and

294
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,519
then we need to update coordination plan

295
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,320
so

296
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,959
then during this change with whom we're

297
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,880
going to talk differently and

298
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,240
communicate differently which

299
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,480
stakeholders for example we establish

300
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,560
some digital forensic capability because

301
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,240
we need to acquire something from mobile

302
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,160
phones does it mean that we're going to

303
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,399
talk differently with police

304
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,680
uh or

305
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,360
where else we can what we are talking or

306
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,200
plan to talk or to the media or to

307
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,120
others so how we communicate

308
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,959
and as well how we protect our

309
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,240
operations

310
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,000
and then you say okay how do i implement

311
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,079
myself or i run the tenders for

312
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,079
acquiring technology or what do you do

313
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,480
and then implementation it's then simple

314
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,720
you have a paper plan then you just

315
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,399
execute

316
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,800
on each other point and the

317
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,720
important part here

318
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,399
when you finish everything

319
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,800
lounge communication and celebrations

320
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,880
i'm very bad at celebrating

321
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,640
i hope you are better that when you

322
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,399
achieve something and celebration is

323
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,640
important for others to get aware that

324
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,079
you changed

325
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,279
now you're going to do differently

326
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
so if you think from

327
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,079
somewhere to somewhere better

328
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,560
there is there are particular activities

329
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,000
what people

330
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,240
or teams usually do

331
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,600
what are these activities

332
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,600
one is

333
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,399
maturity management of maturity

334
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,600
uh

335
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,920
assessing and then building a roadmap

336
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,360
for example what i showed for the

337
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,120
improvements

338
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,200
so there are two main maturity models

339
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,279
that you can use so i suggest you use

340
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,160
one of them or if you believe or you are

341
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,320
very much aligned to for example ibm as

342
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,680
a vendor ibm has their own maturity but

343
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,880
i i consider that it's a subset of good

344
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,720
practices which you some of you maybe

345
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,760
stay for some three for next week to to

346
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,240
get trained

347
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,839
sim 3 is lightweight comparing to soccer

348
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,839
mm anyone tried soccer mmm

349
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,320
it's very very detailed it's big excel

350
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,360
sheet uh excel file and then in order to

351
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,440
drop to the zero level it takes one hour

352
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,040
of clicking

353
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,959
i tried so

354
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,920
uh recently uh rob vanoss maybe three

355
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,680
weeks ago

356
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,399
he

357
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,880
launched the licensing model which comes

358
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,040
with additional book how

359
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,360
for 500 euros as a supporter you get the

360
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,959
book as well how to do self assessments

361
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,040
better and

362
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,279
go there so i suggest at least to look

363
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,200
at these two models

364
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,880
to understand

365
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,040
what maturity could bring to you because

366
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,279
nobody else can dump that knowledge into

367
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,680
you unfortunately

368
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,720
another good area to focus on is to open

369
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,320
the document which defines the

370
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,079
expectations from you

371
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,000
so what authority do you have in

372
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,839
organization or in the country in the

373
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,920
sector or wherever

374
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,199
i'm sorry

375
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,160
and

376
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,560
what is the strategy to achieve that

377
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,440
what authority and what responsibilities

378
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,279
and think

379
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,920
does your wife understands what it is or

380
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,880
you know or husband or good friend or

381
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,240
your dog or

382
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,320
like is it clear

383
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,480
if it's written is it clear is it how

384
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,760
much

385
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,480
uh and clarity is there or in between

386
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,639
the lines what's not clear because more

387
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,279
you have unclear things more of your

388
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,959
service recipients get confused

389
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,959
so first of all you have to

390
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,360
be very very clear what you do

391
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
for example even mapping to the other

392
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,680
models what i'm going to talk about

393
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,680
and then communicating that clear

394
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,240
message for example because as in

395
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,440
justin's talk on sectorial one

396
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,000
one definition was sectorial cset is

397
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,440
responsible

398
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,880
for incident coordination in the sector

399
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,720
not coordination resolution or something

400
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,000
like this

401
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,760
then suddenly it's not clear what does

402
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,440
it mean in the sector so who defines

403
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,399
what's so any bank's incident is the

404
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,199
role of sectorial set or how does it

405
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,079
work

406
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,600
if something is unclear it's a

407
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,360
opportunity to discuss

408
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
and agree

409
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,560
because it's always about local context

410
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,199
good then uh services model then you

411
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,639
clarified what is expected from you

412
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,519
then you can see through which service

413
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,600
model you can actually achieve that how

414
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,920
to map what exactly gonna do in order

415
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,320
for that clarity to be transformed in

416
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,600
the serving

417
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,839
uh way

418
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,320
then for those uh

419
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,240
who like to measure or understand or

420
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,760
practice measuring you have enough

421
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,160
energy then kpis

422
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,839
here i'm going to show examples of

423
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,639
monthly kpis uh the wonderful job is

424
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,800
being done in metric sig

425
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,560
on the

426
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,639
instant metrics and kpis uh so

427
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,839
there's going to be more more

428
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,240
publications on this from first

429
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,000
and reviewing the skills and competences

430
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,959
from different models so nist nice

431
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,680
have you heard about this nice

432
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,880
it's a big database big table of uh many

433
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,959
positions with a lot of skills mapped

434
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,119
and

435
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,639
abilities and tasks and competences

436
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,880
now anissa in europe

437
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,079
is about to publish in september 12

438
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,519
roles of cyber security in europe

439
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,040
drafts are already there on anissa's

440
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,399
website if you're interested to look at

441
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,560
it there's going to be conference in in

442
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,199
athens on this topic

443
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,399
uh the new job work what was done

444
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,959
in first is mapping cset services

445
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,759
framework into

446
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,199
roles 26 or 27 roles i'm going to show

447
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,720
the picture of it and where you can find

448
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,880
it

449
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,279
additionally for skills and competences

450
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,120
you know to make clarity in your head

451
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,560
and saying this is what would you want

452
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,639
that means nothing else we do

453
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,519
to such level of clarity

454
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,639
you can

455
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,800
check how to train your staff including

456
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,000
managers and others uh into

457
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,839
such situations so

458
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,199
what i just said

459
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,800
what actually is done so if we look at

460
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,600
it from design perspective where

461
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,440
what we try to

462
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,240
achieve kind of four things

463
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,640
clear c set saw governance model

464
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,919
extensive use of existing knowledge

465
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,839
appropriately especially for those who

466
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,400
just came back from auditorium martin

467
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,000
was explaining

468
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,559
about mitra attack how he tried to use

469
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,039
and appropriately and

470
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,199
he got challenged so you need to know

471
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,440
which tool fits for what purpose that's

472
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,200
partially i'm

473
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,440
here to to guide you for this as well or

474
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,080
inspire you

475
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,559
balance resources people processes

476
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,760
technology

477
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,200
and then

478
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,640
create for yourself because there is no

479
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,559
way to copy from others

480
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,000
a on applicable kpis

481
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,160
uh what was that so

482
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,640
for example you could start it's not

483
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,919
something that you should copy but you

484
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,000
can flex your brains

485
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
if you get enough coffee so for example

486
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,120
it be so that my set and sock

487
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,480
main purpose of existence is to reduce

488
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,640
negative overall impact of cyber

489
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,440
security incidents

490
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,799
can i

491
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,799
identify with such statement if not

492
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,720
what's not fitting and then adjust and

493
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,160
build something for yourself for your

494
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,400
team to understand exactly what's the

495
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,480
what is the purpose you're serving

496
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,000
because at the end of the day that means

497
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,240
the shining eyes of people understanding

498
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,840
what's happening for example so this is

499
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,640
strategic but the two other ones are

500
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
the meaning to establish sets probably

501
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,480
for modernizing it's not so relevant

502
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,760
i try to see in design thinking

503
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,160
particularly in in in models so i see

504
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,600
that this team instant response

505
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,960
capability

506
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,480
technical capability operational

507
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,600
capabilities box in the middle and then

508
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,520
via interrelations

509
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,240
first is on the side policy makers and

510
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,360
sisa vets who are tasked to ensure that

511
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,679
incidents are reduced and then that's

512
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,200
why the

513
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,960
operational team is here

514
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,520
then if is a if you are national team

515
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,440
then this one is not applicable what's

516
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,039
important that you

517
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,280
formalize relationships or

518
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,039
semi-formalized relationships with law

519
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,679
enforcement

520
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,440
intelligence agencies private

521
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,520
organizations and

522
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,520
research organizations as such

523
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,280
and you're usually objective practically

524
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,760
it's detection coordination resolution

525
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,720
incidents being vulnerabilities

526
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,880
information gathering etc depending on

527
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
your role are you coordinating or

528
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,960
actually

529
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,400
responding team

530
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,160
for for whom for digital asset

531
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,440
protection

532
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,720
that's in simple so

533
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
i want to connect as well to overall

534
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,400
picture in the country

535
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,160
because

536
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,799
for sectoral seasons talk if somebody

537
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,960
were there um

538
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,000
then

539
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,840
justin was mentioning that you need to

540
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,720
be aware and start from the

541
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,640
what's around you

542
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,720
and see that how disruption will be i

543
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,360
would advocate start from your essence

544
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,000
and then try to inc interrelate and then

545
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,200
adjust

546
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,159
uh

547
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,480
to where so all the cyber diplomacy

548
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,919
cyber literacy cyber crime cyber defense

549
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,120
strategy critical information

550
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,600
infrastructures

551
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,080
and see how your team can adapt create

552
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,600
more value in your organization

553
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,039
or in your country

554
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,559
now so

555
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,120
this is what i have in front of my desk

556
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,840
besides me always with me

557
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,039
with detailed structure so

558
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,200
the title is

559
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,120
cset services model

560
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,080
c set that's probably not a sock right

561
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,280
so for me this picture represents

562
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,280
incident response

563
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,880
domain

564
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,120
where you can identify

565
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,240
different

566
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,640
type of organizations who choose

567
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,919
the services now if your site does

568
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,840
something else

569
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,640
what's not here not in 80 pages

570
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,960
publication

571
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,400
then probably it's not in incident

572
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,720
response or it is supported a function

573
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,000
that's not the

574
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,520
direct value creation to your

575
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,080
constituency for example you write good

576
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,320
documentation documenting processes etc

577
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
so it's not a service so here's a

578
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,080
services

579
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,360
model

580
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,480
so uh how do i look at it uh

581
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,799
if i think about different organizations

582
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,000
but it's just choose and pick

583
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,159
just socks usually always pick

584
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,000
monitoring because when we say sock we

585
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,440
expect

586
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,400
to be infrastructure which is monitored

587
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,880
for sets sometimes there is no monitored

588
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,320
infrastructure

589
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,080
on the national sectoral level probably

590
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,480
when oh it's monitored in darkness dark

591
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,760
nets

592
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,200
dac webs and

593
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,480
other places

594
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,799
so these models are valuable as well to

595
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,200
pre make clarity

596
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,520
understand and here there might be some

597
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,960
challenges for you for example if you

598
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,120
practice thread hunting

599
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,600
you you're gonna see oh how come it's

600
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,559
not in stock or monitoring but it's in

601
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,559
traditional awareness

602
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,000
maybe next question is going to be

603
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,120
updated

604
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,280
but so far is for communication what's

605
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,760
the difference between awareness

606
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,640
training or knowledge sharing versus

607
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,440
communication on third intelligence

608
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,320
so by reading the the bible the the the

609
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,919
main book uh

610
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,159
of first for sister services you can

611
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,520
find the

612
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
answers or as well can discuss and then

613
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,320
get

614
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,559
some some additional guidance

615
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,840
so what's new now is uh from last week i

616
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,360
think

617
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,320
this

618
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,360
these areas of services are mapped to

619
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,720
the

620
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,640
new roles so 26 roles

621
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,400
here and then

622
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,200
the usual suspects in

623
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,120
trying to create in this practice in

624
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,559
design thinking

625
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,080
and for example incident

626
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,400
incident analyst role

627
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,880
is defined uh something like this

628
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,559
an additional text

629
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,760
mapping to nest uh nice competences not

630
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,280
the tasks not the skills because it's

631
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,080
too detailed you get confused there

632
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,080
and it's gonna be fin now it's for the

633
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,400
review so if you have some thoughts on

634
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,280
it before we creating it finally in

635
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,520
october november or december

636
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,799
um

637
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,880
you're very very welcome so if for

638
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,840
particular services you don't know

639
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,080
what what kind of roles how to to do it

640
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,320
so this guidance is additional one from

641
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,279
fast

642
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,240
from last week

643
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,559
the knowledge summaries in free

644
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,840
everywhere more and more for maturity of

645
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,120
organization

646
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,360
service model just mentioned

647
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,799
we often

648
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,760
come to our rsit

649
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,679
taxonomy again

650
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,760
where vulnerabilities are vulnerable

651
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,840
system is defined as a type of incident

652
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,039
that means when we work with

653
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,760
vulnerabilities in the incident if we

654
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,480
can be treated as incident response even

655
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,000
though maybe it's in another domain

656
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,200
when social mem for detailed diagnostics

657
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,080
to tuning uh some bolts in your

658
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,120
processes i.t systems responsibilities

659
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,520
then there are few

660
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,840
set setup guides

661
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,559
i like most organization american states

662
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,640
is going to be renewed soon this year

663
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,720
probably it's a visual it's

664
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,880
inspirational the national one as well

665
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,240
is from gfce um i think it's quite good

666
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,679
and with case studies tysat won

667
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,120
lovely as well they're two versions i

668
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,840
think on the first website it's um

669
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,840
not so graphically nice

670
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,559
comparing to what's on on their website

671
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,120
and then membership in organizations to

672
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,720
access their knowledge which is not

673
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,440
written because we can have it only by

674
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,080
asking and getting replies

675
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,679
so

676
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,159
the third area is

677
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,559
where we balance and the

678
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,799
challenges is that

679
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,200
the processes probably are not tuned to

680
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,440
optimum but now in order to have

681
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,360
processes well-defined processes we have

682
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,120
to practice and then document what you

683
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,720
do if we start building on on

684
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,640
whiteboard we can over process over

685
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,799
create something so it's mostly about

686
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,799
what we do in in

687
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,240
incremental improvement

688
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,080
very good talk was yesterday about

689
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,200
documentation from and we saw

690
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,159
uh i think all of that as well

691
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,320
is included here in processes

692
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,640
so for processes how i see it

693
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,400
typically so there's a service at least

694
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,600
there should be

695
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,400
one process automating that service and

696
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,559
that so definition what are inputs what

697
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,400
are outputs who is responsible what it

698
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,960
does and then workflows workflows

699
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,720
building procedures so graphical

700
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,000
workflows where it starts where it

701
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,400
finishes as well as the responsibilities

702
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,720
and description of each of the step

703
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,880
and then it brings clarity so that's

704
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,720
what we do and there could be

705
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,559
you know begin in workflow could be

706
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,640
start doing something finish

707
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,960
or you split into two boxes because

708
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,559
there's dependence at first we do this

709
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,120
and we finish with the other thing

710
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,799
and you cannot copy paste from another

711
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,520
organization so you need to build that

712
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,200
for yourself

713
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,039
for people

714
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,240
probably you lack skills on hands and

715
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,640
if the process is an expectation and the

716
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,880
value creation is tuned well

717
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,320
then it should be easy for you to

718
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,000
understand how many and why you need

719
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,840
malwa analysts

720
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,080
as a title and other hands same with

721
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,840
digital forensic

722
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,559
because what i hear it's a it's a sexy

723
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,919
terms

724
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,600
milo analyst digital forensic

725
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,840
penetration testers uh something where

726
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,600
technologists really

727
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,679
want to associate with

728
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,640
uh in reality probably

729
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,360
it's not fast priority for your

730
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,199
organization according to the mandate

731
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,919
and the technology

732
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,080
usually not fully utilize the what is

733
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,960
acquired so i suggest you

734
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,120
i hope all of you went through the

735
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,720
different vendors

736
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,720
as a homework

737
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,919
when you look

738
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,679
in here

739
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,600
you could think okay i saw

740
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
automation to vendors right where would

741
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,720
they fit for which services i saw

742
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,399
threat intelligence

743
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,840
or

744
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,240
ctm 360 probably here institutional

745
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,720
awareness again the model would

746
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,559
decided not to use threat intelligence

747
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,880
because it's not a service

748
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,039
but what we see institutional awareness

749
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,760
with services acquisition analysis and

750
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,760
communication out internally or

751
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,000
externally

752
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,159
so it's a good thing to to to exercise

753
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,520
and to say okay i have different

754
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,000
technology stack and manual things and

755
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,480
maybe i'm thinking about introducing for

756
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,200
example for fellows arctic security so

757
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,159
what services that would allow me to

758
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,799
automate and how i come in the morning

759
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,480
at 8 o'clock in the morning to the

760
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,919
office what i'm going to do with this

761
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,399
tool in order to successfully deliver

762
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,120
the services

763
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,200
good and then kpis

764
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,279
probably it's not bad kpi it was

765
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,440
probably at night writing it

766
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,279
always like does not create any value it

767
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,799
creates some value but

768
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,840
what's important

769
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,120
as examples probably

770
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,840
as well these are examples

771
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,840
for you to think through and think would

772
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,360
it make you

773
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,120
a sense to you so there's something what

774
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,320
we measure

775
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,039
and what we expect it to be for example

776
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,360
number of open incidents at the end of a

777
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,159
month

778
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,080
we expect through the month should be

779
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,600
more than zero because if it's zero

780
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,200
then

781
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,080
it's a question what kind of

782
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,559
organization maybe it's okay but usually

783
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,320
it should be at least something so how

784
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,120
we validate to the management

785
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,880
if we see

786
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,080
incident regis registered like reporting

787
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,640
at the end of a month to see what

788
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,919
actually happened this month from doing

789
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,480
analysis

790
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,559
checking for example if sectoral one

791
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,559
which constituency contingent

792
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,480
constituency open tickets

793
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,559
and do we truly believe that others did

794
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,600
not have incidents

795
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,760
and maybe that's another opportunity and

796
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,320
reason to discuss how they're doing

797
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,559
especially if you have multiple

798
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,760
departments uh and uh and others

799
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,320
uh this one total number of

800
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,480
outstanding not closed incidents in

801
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,760
tracking system

802
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,200
should not increase because if it's

803
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,919
increasing it's a becomes red flag that

804
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,000
we cannot cope and we should do

805
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,320
stud taking decisions towards that for

806
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,320
example close everything what's two

807
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,120
months old

808
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,799
uh how much sla breaches

809
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,600
then other ones um

810
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,320
can be for

811
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,679
awareness for for other topics so the

812
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,919
presentation is going to be placed

813
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,919
public so it's for

814
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,919
for something to think about as a

815
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,480
bootstrapping the thinking

816
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,559
because probably you can we will never

817
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,200
copy these but we could be oh but

818
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,880
actually we can have a look at

819
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,799
particular service from another angle

820
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,960
and think about it

821
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,880
maybe that's what we're going to be as a

822
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,200
and all the metrics should be what you

823
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,440
imagine how you're going to use it

824
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,440
so you say oh i'm going to use it for

825
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,799
this and then talk to maybe to the

826
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,440
management of annual report etc

827
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,440
and if it does is not useful then you

828
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,640
should stop collecting

829
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,200
good so

830
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,799
another question what i got through the

831
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,240
conference

832
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,880
but what is this threat or sock the

833
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,120
end so here is a

834
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,519
schema what we draw

835
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,200
to illustrate that we are different

836
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,279
sizes of teams

837
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,880
and and what does it mean different

838
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,880
sizes it means different complexity

839
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,880
different amount of people

840
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,440
different length to become strong

841
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,240
operationally

842
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,519
and what i mentioned about audit so for

843
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,679
most complex

844
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:26,799
teams

845
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,080
usually you you already need soc cmm and

846
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,039
then target particular level for normal

847
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,760
operational teams of seven to fifteen

848
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,080
people sim three is uh

849
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,200
kind of

850
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,519
trying to to target the for example

851
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,360
either

852
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,880
tfc set

853
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,679
certified level sim 3 or if you're from

854
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,559
european union than european union

855
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,600
basic intermediate advanced and play

856
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,679
with these markings and smaller ones

857
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:56,960
probably

858
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,640
not measure now actually there should be

859
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,240
because if you are a member first

860
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,720
because we promote it very strongly then

861
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,880
here measurement should be a

862
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,880
membership profile should be heard

863
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,440
so

864
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,159
what you can get from outside

865
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,080
what i see is probably these topics but

866
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,279
you can

867
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,679
go around and ask

868
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,600
and there are different projects in that

869
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,760
for example cyber for dev

870
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,799
uh from european union assist many

871
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,799
countries and we you can ask on these

872
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,799

873
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,399
consultancy

874
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,000
or inspiration and uh

875
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,880

878
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,679
this capability so thank you very much i

879
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,120

887
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,720
socks these isaac servers and i got

888
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,559
annoyed of it so on linkedin page i

889
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,880
wrote an article which i take as a

890
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,679
definition for me which comes from two

891
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,760
statements one is

892
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,360

894
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,120
domain

895
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,720
and then second

896
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,519
statement is depending on the title for

897
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,960
example sock with primary objective to

898
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960

899
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,000
