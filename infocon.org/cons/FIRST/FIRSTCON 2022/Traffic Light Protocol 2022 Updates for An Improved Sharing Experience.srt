[Music]

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,199
tlp protocol the traffic light protocol

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,960
and so that's why we're all dressed in

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,840
colors up here

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,439
they are the

27
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,439
the tlp sick the special interest group

and they have

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,840
prepared this new

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,640
protocol for first which has just been

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,400
approved the tlp version 2.0 i have just

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,920
learned it's called

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,119
so uh take the scene done and oh is it

35

will stop we'll start

37
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,360
all right good afternoon everyone

38
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,799
um

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,840
so

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,520

lunch you can now start to take a nap

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,560
um now so i was just going to start with

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,119
a little bit of a how we got here story

44
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,720
about the traffic light protocol how

45
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,439
it's invented um where it sort of comes

46
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,280
from what the impetus was behind its

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,399
creation

48
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,719
and uh and the

49
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,280
road that led us to where we are today

50
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,079
um

51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,119
so all the way back in 1999

52
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,360
uh in the united kingdom they

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,959
established the national infrastructure

54
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,440
security coordination center or nicey as

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,000
it's pronounced

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,040
and this was to part of this was to

57
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,800
establish ways for infrastructure

58
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,360
sectors to uh to share in sensitive

59
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,800
information amongst themselves about

60
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,480
risks that they face

61
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,959
about um you know about mitigation

62
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,720
safeguards countermeasures and that sort

63
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,680
of thing

64
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,239
um not just for cyber security but for a

65
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,959
number of different types of risks uh if

66
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,680
you remember like in 1999 cyber security

67
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,440
was barely even a word

68
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,000
um so the world has of course changed a

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,239
lot since then but

70
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,440
um

71
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,319
during the very early 2000s obviously as

72
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,400
you can see they started to establish

73
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,480
what uh in the uk are called information

74
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,879
exchanges in the united states we call

75
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,720
them ice acts or information sharing and

76
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,319
analysis centers um we also there's also

77
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,080
a number of things called information

78
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,480
sharing analysis organizations all of

79
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,280
these exist to sort of do similar things

80
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,599
which is to share information generally

81
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,040
between different private sector

82
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,680
institutions that otherwise would uh

83
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,599
would probably not share sensitive

84
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,599
information with one another especially

85
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,640
about uh

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,920
anything that could be used for

87
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
competitive purposes but

88
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,440
the point being that this sort of like

89
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,360
risk stuff that affects an entire sector

90
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,159
or affects an entire um sort of sub

91
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,959
sector or even a group like we have one

92
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,519
in the u.s for faith-based organizations

93
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,000
for example or one for real estate

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,080
um so all of these different types of

95
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,480
things needed a better way to

96
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,720
mark information that was not classified

97
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,480
in any sense because that's not what

98
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,239
these people were dealing with but there

99
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,840
was sensitive enough to merit sort of

100
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,120
you know like some kind of control

101
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,560
scheme

102
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,439
and

103
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,360
they uh and they created they came up

104
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,519
with traffic light what you know the

105
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,439
very very original version of traffic

106
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,200
light protocol

107
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,400
which is sort of very informal

108
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,159
was not a classification scheme which

109
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,480
tlp is still not a classification scheme

110
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,280
just to be clear right up front

111
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,760
and the original one had five colors i

112
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,880
just wanted to include that for trivia

113
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,600
and

114
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,079
this was inspired it was inspired by

115
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,079
caveat markings for sharing classified

116
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,160
material as anybody in the room ever

117
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,840
heard of or con for example

118
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,199
okay a couple of people know what an

119
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,280
oricon is that stands for originator

120
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,520
controlled and is sort of like the

121
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,960
original inspiration for example tlp red

122
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,080
which means you have to ask me

123
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,600
permission before you can share this any

124
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,280
further with anybody

125
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,320
um

126
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,520
so during the 2000s uh tlp sort of

127
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,800
spread

128
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,919
throughout especially uh like uh i think

129
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:52,960
to

130
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,720
ian bryant told me all this history he

131
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,840
basically said you know he started

132
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,360
spreading throughout you know

133
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,199
at first northern europe

134
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,560
um

135
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,000
and uh

136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,919
and made its way into other things and

137
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,759
made its way into like recommendations

138
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,160
from the task force for sea certs in in

139
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,560
europe and started to slowly but

140
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,800
gradually or slowly and gradually why

141
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,440
did i that's redundant anyway sorry

142
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,479
apologies um slowly make its way through

143
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,400
the world

144
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,759
and then um

145
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,880
and then this is how i get involved

146
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,560
specifically

147
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,520
i think it was

148
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,639
here's the scenario as i recall it

149
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,440
we were sharing all of our stuff from us

150
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,560
cert

151
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,199
as unclassified for official use only

152
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,639
which is a government marking which we

153
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,320
use for things that should stay within

154
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,560
the government and we would do this by

155
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,240
default and really without thinking very

156
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,680
hard about it at all

157
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,440
and so we would share things

158
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,520
unclassified for official use only and

159
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,120
then we'd send them off to places like

160
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,880
the treasury department

161
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,639
with the expectation

162
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,479
unspoken in some cases that the treasury

163
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,840
department would then share it with the

164
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,400
financial sector in the u.s that was the

165
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,479
desired end state

166
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,000
it turns out all of these things got to

167
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,199
the treasury department because of

168
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,639
internal policies there they said oh it

169
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,240
says for official use only that means it

170
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,520
stays within the government we can't

171
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,039
share it outside of the government and

172
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,560
then the financial sector would get wind

173
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,720
of this and be like we never got any of

174
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,639
your indicators of compromise that you

175
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,759
just shared

176
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,520
and we're like why do you mean we gave

177
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,720
them the treasury department we told

178
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,400
them to send them to you and they were

179
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
like yeah we can't see any because you

180
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,919
put fou on there you put for official

181
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,120
use only

182
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,360
um so we got yelled at a little bit

183
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
and the suggestion was why can't you

184
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,440
just use top like all of our partners

185
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,600
from you know other parts of the world

186
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,919
um especially again in europe

187
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,080
and uh and we're like oh yeah tlp we see

188
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,680
that sometimes from our international

189
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,360
partners they send stuff to us with tlp

190
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,639
markings on it and we kind of know what

191
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,800
it means we kind of know what it means

192
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,520
and we try to adhere to it um but yeah

193
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,960
we don't really use it on a day-to-day

194
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,720
basis and then

195
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,599
because i'm the guy at sizza that i was

196
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,960
the guy at us certain now i'm the guy

197
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,319
that says it who deals with random stuff

198
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,840
that nobody else you know really wants

199
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,599
to touch they were just sort of like hey

200
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,039
this tlp thing figure out how to

201
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,759
implement it you know you're the guy now

202
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,520
and i became the action officer for

203
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,919
implementing traffic light protocol uh

204
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,560
at us cert and what's the first thing i

205
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,479
did

206
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,400
i wrote a new version of tlp just for

207
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,440
myself

208
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,759
um so i tried to adhere to everything it

209
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,840
said but of course i wanted to like oh i

210
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,120
think i can phrase this better in you

211
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,280
know like special cool american english

212
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,960
so boom boom boom boom boom knocked out

213
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
a new version of tlp

214
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,039
with some slight tweaks to things threw

215
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,680
it up on the uscert.gov website and it

216
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,120
stayed there and then all the private

217
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,560
sector partners that we were sharing

218
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,919
with throughout all of the ice acts in

219
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,800
america started to uh to use that

220
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,199
and then we got immediately got into

221
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,800
some disagreements with other partners

222
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,879
you know like hey your tlp is not 100

223
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,639
compatible with mine

224
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,479
and then i also started to notice i was

225
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,000
like hey wait a minute

226
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,840
now new zealand has their own version of

227
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,599
tlp now these partners have their own

228
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,440
version of tlp this is proliferating and

229
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,879
this is going to be a real problem if we

230
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,919
don't try to do something um soon

231
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,280
and

232
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,919
uh so in 2015

233
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,879
we established the tlp sig

234
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,639
and

235
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,319
which everybody in this room should join

236
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,080
obviously if you're not already a member

237
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,400
first tlp was established and uh

238
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,319
basically because i thought first was

239
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,840
the obvious home

240
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,400
for a standard version of this and i

241
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,160
thought it was the best way to ensure

242
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,479
broadest adoption of a standard version

243
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,559
uh throughout all of the member teams

244
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,159
and their partner organizations that we

245
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,760
work with in infrastructure throughout

246
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,440
the world

247
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,799
so

248
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,120
you now you know me

249
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,799
you probably know don

250
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,919
we uh

251
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,720
we pushed out tlp 1.0

252
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,399
in 2016

253
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,360
um

254
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,959
after the uh shortly after the

255
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,640
conference in

256
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,839
yeah 2015 yes seoul 2016 was seoul and

257
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,160
um yeah and then we were off to the

258
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,959
races and everything was great

259
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,880
for almost 15 minutes

260
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,600
all right and i'm going to hand that off

261
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,240
to you sir

262
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,320
and they lived happily ever after

263
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,160
well let's see

264
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,920
so um

265
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,320
well i think we were kind of quiet for a

266
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,760
few years

267
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,200
so the group was still there but there

268
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,800
wasn't much activity every now and then

269
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,240
somebody had some

270
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,480
ideas but we really started working on a

271
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,800
new round of consultation in

272
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,560
in 2019

273
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,640
and yesterday

274
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,480
i had a look at the current membership

275
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,399
of the sick it's over 50 people

276
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,360
and

277
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,959
very well very good is that they really

278
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,200
come from from all over the world which

279
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,200
also illustrates the fact that tlp has

280
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,519
this has had this major take-up in so

281
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,120
many places

282
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,680
i could even mention a few countries you

283
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,880
have coded top in part of their national

284
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,320
law

285
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,040
so

286
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,000
even that exists

287
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,839
and in our group is also non-first

288
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,920
members so what did we what did we do in

289
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,279
this consultation well first of all the

290
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,040
starting point was this is now a

291
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,200
standard basically and the standard

292
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,360
needs stability so could we have come up

293
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,880
with something entirely new well of

294
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,000
course but

295
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,680
we wouldn't have become very popular i

296
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,800
think

297
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,320
so we were talking about content

298
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,120
improvements we're talking about uh some

299
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,519
changes in regards changing times we

300
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,880
will come to that

301
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,399
language

302
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,000
and certainly also

303
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,399
because that was a critique in 2016 and

304
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,200
that was justified in 16 basically we

305
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
came up with a new version and that was

306
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,279
mostly that and now we want to come up

307
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,120
with more supporting materials

308
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,040
we worked for

309
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,920
some

310
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,000
almost two years and came up with a new

311
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,839
draft that we sent out to the world

312
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,200
quite widely

313
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,920
many fora were included in a very wide

314
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,880
distribution and we got

315
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,920
a big number of responses back

316
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,600
a lot of them were focusing on the same

317
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,120
kind of issues

318
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,480
but that was a great help and we

319
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,560
actually changed our

320
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,680
draft in a few key places due to all the

321
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,760
comments that came in so this last

322
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,079
consultation round was absolutely very

323
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,600
very useful

324
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,839
and after that we discussed it again in

325
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,800
the

326
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,399
in the special interest group of course

327
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,360
the zig

328
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,399
and went for approval by the first board

329
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,760
which

330
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,399
we received

331
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,440
and um well here are the the main

332
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,880
changes

333
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,680
so we clarified the standard text on

334
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
in a lot of places it's very funny

335
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,000
because i actually contributed to the

336
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,600
to the dutch my own language to the

337
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,959
dutch translation of the tlp v1 and only

338
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,720
when i started translating it into my

339
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,720
own language i sort of started noting

340
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,880
that there were obscurities unclarities

341
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,480
in the text which i never noticed before

342
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,920
because i was always reading the english

343
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,240
text again and again

344
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,240
so with that in mind and people other

345
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,079
people had similar experiences of course

346
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,360
we really tried

347
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
to get more unified languages so we

348
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,040
removed all the literature in there we

349
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,760
removed all the synonyms and other nice

350
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,560
things we even removed things where we

351
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,160
could have probably a three hour debate

352
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,000
on that with with some of you but for

353
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,320
instance um

354
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,560
my english is mostly british english and

355
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,079
i would say to whom

356
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,600
but most of the people on the planet say

357
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,880
to who so it's this kind of

358
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,800
simplifications that we

359
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,600
for some people improvement that we

360
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,560
inserted into the uh text because the

361
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,079
target audience is really people

362
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,920
worldwide and not people who are very

363
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,480
very proficient at uh at english so we

364
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,839
wanted to keep it as straight and simple

365
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,320
as possible language wise

366
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,120
we added definitions for community

367
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,880
organization and clients and we used

368
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,200
those definitions in the

369
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
top

370
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,519
texts so for instance if you may wonder

371
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,760
why does have this awful kind of

372
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,200
great green t-shirt well i would

373
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
normally never wear this but thanks to a

374
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
good idea of tom we were you know we

375
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,399
were wearing top colors

376
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,800
and i i got stuck with green

377
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
anyway green

378
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,680
is the color that in the description uh

379
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,639
corresponds with the idea of a community

380
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,040
and and so we we did our best to map the

381
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,680
the terms used in those definitions onto

382
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,839
the various

383
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,519
definitions we added the colors table

384
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,880
which now also has rgb cmyk and hex

385
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,760
colors and some improvements to

386
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,920
accessibility which was i think mostly

387
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,639
the top red was improved color-wise if i

388
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,120
yes because it was a little hard to read

389
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,360
under certain circumstances

390
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,880
and then we come to the more

391
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,279
major changes this is absolutely a major

392
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,240
change

393
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,800
we changed uh top y to tlp clear

394
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,839
now we're really sorry but

395
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,560
uh the text you'll be clear should still

396
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,639
be on there but that's obviously not the

397
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,160
case

398
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,880
yeah this of course is um in line with

399
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,399
all the discussions that we've had in

400
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,240
regard also blacklisting whitelisting

401
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,240
and i do not need to

402
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,440
reiterate that and we decided as a group

403
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,519
that we want to move away from the top

404
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,880
white and move away from all the

405
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,199
discussions associated with that at

406
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,120
first we went for in the consultation

407
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,279
that went out last november for top

408
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,720
public

409
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,560
but lots of people said that's not a

410
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,639
caller

411
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,040
which is correct and then our good

412
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
friend scott mcintyre who i think these

413
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,000
days is in australia came up with the

414
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,440
good idea to

415
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,560
label it top clear and everybody who was

416
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,000
involved in that discussion at that

417
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,959
stage

418
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,800
uh who was not against this change

419
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,399
agreed with that so to be clear

420
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,800
it is

421
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,519
and then finally another important

422
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,440
change we had one of the ongoing

423
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,760
discussions we had

424
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,639
since 2015 actually

425
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,480
was on tlp amber

426
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,920
there were people who said we need to

427
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,000
reintroduce top yellow or something like

428
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,120
that we need to make things more

429
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,600
complicated

430
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,920
we actually sticked with the tlpmer and

431
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,839
we also stick with dlpm topmer in the

432
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,320
meaning it got in version 1

433
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,760
for obvious reasons to avoid confusion

434
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,440
and well i'll read that one out you can

435
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,959
read it here yourself

436
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,040
limited disclosure recipients can only

437
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,519
spread this on a need to know

438
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,000
basis within their organization and its

439
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,560
clients so that was the meaning already

440
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,720
in quite a few of the original versions

441
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,480
of top and it was also the meaning that

442
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,959
we coded in tlp version 1 in 2016 but we

443
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,480
added

444
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,399
to and hopefully a lot of those

445
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,079
discussions that we've had the past few

446
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,880
years top amber plus strict without

447
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,360
spaces

448
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,880
which restricts the sharing to the

449
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,560
organization only because this was the

450
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,440
one

451
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,680
that was apparent in some older glp

452
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,360
versions in some parts of the world i

453
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,560
think mostly north america

454
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,440
and by adding that one i think

455
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,600
we made it easier or at least

456
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
standardized the possibility to restrict

457
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,279
it to the organization

458
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,440
only

459
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,240
and that's basically the changes that we

460
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,079
did by the way we'll come to discussion

461
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,160
later of course but first i would like

462
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,000
to give the floor to

463
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,279
to ted

464
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,440
to talk a little about about use cases

465
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,160
that we're working on

466
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,639
thanks don

467
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,759
um i got involved i think it was career

468
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,040
um

469
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,720
probably when tom got the wrong day for

470
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,680
the tlp sig meeting and i'm like where

471
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,600
are you and and he's like it's tomorrow

472
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
and like we're all waiting for you

473
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,040
um

474
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,199
and then tom proceeded to say well at

475
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,000
least everyone's good on tlp green and

476
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,720
i said i'm not and that got into all

477
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,199
sorts of arguments but

478
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,480
one of my favorite things over the last

479
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,480
few years is coming with use cases and

480
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,759
and saying well under these

481
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,079
circumstances

482
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,360
what would you do under these

483
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,279
circumstances what would you do we have

484
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,359
not perfected this by any stretch of the

485
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,799
imagination i've been working on

486
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,000
different versions and trying to make it

487
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,880
more readable more usable etc but we're

488
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,720
still trying to work on these to to make

489
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,439
it

490
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,760
clear and to illustrate to people

491
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,400
what's a good practice

492
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:21,760
one of the

493
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,039
one of the things we got a lot of

494
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,640
feedback on was about sharing with

495
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,520
service providers

496
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,240
i've got this report i just got

497
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,640
i've outsourced

498
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,039
this activity it's affecting this

499
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,360
particular technical thing that we use

500
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
but we've outsourced that

501
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,799
or i've brought in cyber defense

502
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,120
services because i've got an incident um

503
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,600
can i share with these people

504
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,440
now tlp clear is obvious yeah yeah you

505
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,880
can share with everybody you can post it

506
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,080
on the internet i i really don't care

507
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,720
tlp green

508
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,039
in general it's yes

509
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,400
and one of the things we can get into

510
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,760
and i've gotten into with tom is the

511
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,679
whole definition within t.o.p green is

512
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,360
it says with a defined community and if

513
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,480
you define a specific community

514
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,760
and this is this is an argument for

515
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,520
later on but it's an argument that that

516
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,039
probably will come up for version 2.1

517
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,799
is what are these whole notions of

518
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,559
community definitions and community

519
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,880
interactions if i go and say

520
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,799
i want to share this with

521
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,960
a broad audience but not too broad an

522
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,480
audience can i go and say i want this

523
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,360
just with the automotive sector

524
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,520
in north america

525
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,360
um

526
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,200
is that different than tlp amber where i

527
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,320
send it to people in the automotive

528
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,360
sector but they don't know who they can

529
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,400
share with

530
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,640
so in general if there's no restrictions

531
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
on it on the tlb green

532
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,919
yeah you can go ahead and share with

533
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,559
your service providers not a problem

534
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,120
tlp amber and tlpm restrict no

535
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,160
it says within your organization and

536
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,960
your clients and as tom said there are

537
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,440
definitions as to what our clients what

538
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,919
is an organization

539
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,120
so

540
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,559
an organization is not necessarily

541
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,000
somebody you've outsourced and brought

542
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,559
people into

543
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,960
if you need that

544
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,240
always talk

545
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,840
have a chat to the people who are

546
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,080
providing you the information and say

547
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,720
can i get either instructions in line so

548
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,480
in the document in whatever you're

549
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,240
receiving that gives me instructions it

550
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,520
says

551
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,760
yeah it's tlp amber

552
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,440
but you can

553
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,000
share this with outsized organizations

554
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,840
or maybe outsized organizations within

555
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,720
this

556
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,120
country or whatever definition you think

557
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,440
is you're comfortable with

558
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,440
um

559
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,960
maybe you can get ad hoc you can go back

560
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,480
to them and say hey can i share this

561
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,799
they'll respond and say yes go ahead or

562
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,320
get a standing agreement if you've got a

563
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,840
relationship with the organization

564
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,640
that's providing you with this

565
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,320
information you can get something that

566
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,919
says yeah anything we send to you that's

567
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,000
tlp amber

568
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,160
you can share with your you know

569
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,320
outsourced this

570
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,280
and

571
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,440
uh we'll tell you otherwise

572
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,120
that's

573
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,400
regardless if you do not have clarity

574
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,559
talk between the the creator and the

575
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:05,760
recipient

576
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,520
have that conversation

577
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,840
um

578
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,000
tlp amber

579
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
to tlpm restrict that's one of the

580
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,280
things we haven't

581
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,400
put in the um in the definition but it's

582
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
something to keep in mind is that if

583
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,159
you're giving someone permission to

584
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,039
share a tlp amber document

585
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,159
with

586
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,720
a service provider have them change it

587
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,280
to tlpm restrict when they do it

588
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,880
i'd like to see it by default in the

589
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,240
definition but we haven't got that far

590
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,679
yet

591
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,120
the reason is

592
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,799
that it could easily become tlp amber

593
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,400
green and we had a couple of people

594
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,280
raise that issue

595
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,520
i've outsourced i've brought in

596
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,600
a particular commercial incident

597
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,080
response company to help me out and then

598
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,400
said okay i'll give them my tlp amber

599
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,600
document

600
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,400
well

601
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,320
now tlb amber for them says i can give

602
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,760
this all my clients

603
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,679
they give it to all their clients

604
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,320
one of their clients has says oh well

605
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,159
this applies some other some other stuff

606
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,280
that i've outsourced this activity to

607
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,320
say it has to do with your your um

608
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
cash points i've outsourced my cash

609
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,440
points i'll give it to the company that

610
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,960
provides the cash points well now they

611
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,559
out you know can provide that document

612
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,480
to all the the clients that they have

613
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,440
and

614
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,799
some of those have instant response

615
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,720
teams and it can just go around the

616
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,039
world like that so we highly recommend

617
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,720
that if you're sharing it with a service

618
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,000
provider or if you're allowing someone

619
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,440
to share with a service provider change

620
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,960
tlpm or tlb restrict

621
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,520
but it's not it's not in the definition

622
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,760
you have to do that so again the onus is

623
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,120
on the people providing the information

624
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,039
to make sure the recipients understand

625
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,840
your intentions

626
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,080
so anyways that avoids the yoyoing back

627
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,520
and forth

628
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,679
so that's service providers another

629
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,280
use case and i've got a bunch of use

630
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,480
cases that we're working on but just

631
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,200
bring

632
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,480
another one that

633
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,520
is

634
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,200
particular interest to me because i work

635
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,039
in a national c-cert

636
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,400
and we deal a lot with incident

637
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,320
notifications

638
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,480
and one of the things that i've i've

639
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,640
recognized is that we go and always say

640
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,880
well tlp amber on all notifications when

641
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,200
they go out because this should only go

642
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
to the end recipient

643
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,440
the problem is the information that's in

644
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,120
there

645
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,760
you may be less restrictive about how it

646
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
gets shared out

647
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,520
and

648
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
you may go and say well the identity of

649
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,760
the organization is in there so we need

650
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,600
to make sure it's tlp amber but once

651
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,640
that goes to the organization at the end

652
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,760
um

653
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,600
it's their right to go and talk about

654
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,679
things that happen to them so

655
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,919
what we're suggesting is notices go out

656
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,679
at tlp again this is not in the code

657
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,840
this is just a suggestion

658
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,640
notices go out at tpm restrict

659
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,919
but you add

660
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,760
the following information can only be

661
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,520
provided to the end recipient or

662
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,760
necessary intermediaries that allows you

663
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,240
to go to send other national c-certs to

664
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,559
send to telcos isps anybody who's in the

665
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,559
way in order to get to the end recipient

666
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,159
so you give that special instruction

667
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,120
that says it's tlpm restrict

668
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,200
with that caveat until it gets the end

669
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,240
recipient then the information inside

670
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,960
has its own tlp

671
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,880
now it may still be tlp strict if you

672
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,640
don't put anything else it's till tlp

673
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,200
strict the recipient gets it

674
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,480
if it's

675
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,559
amber strict they can't share it with

676
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,840
anyone else

677
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,760
it's only in their organization

678
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,159
but quite often the only reason that

679
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,440
we're putting restrictions on that is

680
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,760
because of the identity or details that

681
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,400
are specific to the end recipient

682
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,279
so what i propose is that you if if you

683
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,080
don't really care as a producer of the

684
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,200
information about what tlp it is you put

685
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,000
that information at tlp white

686
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,760
the end recipient can then go and say

687
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,720
well

688
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,080
there's no way we're going to share this

689
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,360
with anyone so we're just going to keep

690
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,880
it in-house they don't have to share

691
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,240
that information

692
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,840
it's the end recipient's choice of what

693
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,960
to do with it

694
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,720
if they want to share the tlp green with

695
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,960
people great amber with people or just

696
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,760
keep it in-house that's fine

697
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,520
or tlp white they can publish the stuff

698
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,400
on the internet if they want to go

699
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,679
public with it

700
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,000
but if you have sensitive information

701
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,440
that you have shared

702
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,320
with an end recipient with a victim of

703
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,360
of of an incident

704
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,600
you need to go and express that to the

705
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,360
end recipient you say

706
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,440
this information is tlp green or tlp

707
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,039
amber because we don't want you to share

708
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,600
this information any further

709
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,039
you may want to go public with it but

710
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,880
there's information sensitive to us the

711
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,320
producers the creators of this

712
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,600
information that can't be shared

713
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,039
elsewhere and so you need to make sure

714
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,000
that information is is defined

715
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,679
in the core of the message that's

716
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,440
received and so separating those two

717
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,840
elements

718
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,320
so i said those are those are a couple

719
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,320
of examples of use cases that that we

720
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,240
use

721
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,080
and one other thing we're working on is

722
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,480
a cheat sheet because quite often people

723
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,679
like well can i share with this can i

724
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,080
share with these people

725
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,520
we've put together this this little

726
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,760
cheat sheet that goes and says what can

727
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,520
i do with the information

728
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,880
and

729
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,400
there's some key questions of the ones

730
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,720
that people are always asking

731
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,880
and it says given the tlp

732
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,960
if it's got an x no you can't do it

733
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,080
it's got a check mark yes you can do it

734
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,640
if it's got a question mark

735
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,400
it really means no you can't do it but

736
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,480
this is something that people want

737
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,760
a lot so you should probably have a

738
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,159
discussion between the the creator the

739
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,400
originator and the recipient

740
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
to say are we going to have an agreement

741
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,840
back and forth about how we do this

742
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,000
especially we do this regularly

743
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,520
and then there's the little arrow there

744
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,440
and this is something that we may debate

745
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,400
afterwards

746
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,080
um

747
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,600
depends on the definition well we've got

748
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,960
a definition of an organization but if

749
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,799
an organization is a huge conglomerate

750
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,960
you may want to think about saying if

751
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,720
you give it to a parent company that you

752
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,559
don't want to go down to some of the

753
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,640
recipients i'm thinking you know you go

754
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,279
to uh was it um

755
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,760
hitachi i think or whatever is a huge

756
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,080
huge presence with all sorts of you know

757
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
minerals and transport and things like

758
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,600
that if you give it to it transport

759
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,120
element you really want it transport

760
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,080
focused

761
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,320
well do you want it to go to the parent

762
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,000
or the conglomerate and then now down to

763
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,880
all the other sub companies

764
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,760
um

765
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,919
it's not enforced in the standard

766
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,760
something i'd highly recommend depending

767
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,600
on the the shape of the organization

768
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,200
and

769
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,559
i think that's

770
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,879
the next steps

771
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,279
see if this works it does thank you

772
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,880
so next steps

773
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,240
by the way you see the callers right

774
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,840
well tom would you like to explain your

775
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,960
callers

776
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,159
right so this is obviously uh

777
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,960
uh this is obviously tlp amber the way

778
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,480
we all know it today

779
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,559
um and uh the pants are tlp and restrict

780
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,120
sorry trousers the trousers are tlp am

781
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,799
restricted is there a difference between

782
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,000
pants and trousers yes uh yeah okay

783
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,760
and language discussions again let's not

784
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,720
go in there no not yeah it's yeah

785
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,799
so we would like to publish the this has

786
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,679
been agreed with the first word

787
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,919
v2 standard after the conference and

788
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,360
they will become valid at the time of

789
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,880
publication but obviously people will

790
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,799
need time to

791
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,480
to adapt their

792
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,679
their their

793
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,799
protocols their own texts

794
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,880
and sometimes and we have had extensive

795
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,480
discussions about that

796
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,200
it

797
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,279
means that software needs to be changed

798
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,960
firmware needs to be changed because in

799
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,159
some cases

800
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,440
the tlp is coded quite deeply

801
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,320
and

802
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,480
the board we've agreed on the transition

803
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,600
period until the 1st of january of

804
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,480
2023

805
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,559
we will also ask the translators because

806
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,159
there's a few language other language

807
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,640
sources in english on the website to

808
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,559
update their language version because

809
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,679
this translating effort is a voluntary

810
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,399
effort

811
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,640
by by first members and we will ask them

812
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,919
if they want to provide uh updates and

813
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,520
of course we will do communication not

814
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,039
just inside first but in the widest

815
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:16,320
possible way ap cert uh tc cert

816
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,520
oh yes

817
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,600
et cetera yeah you name it all the four

818
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,440
hours we can find them many more

819
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,679
we will communicate this

820
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:24,640
no

821
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,880
and then hope that there will be a big

822
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,320
pickup just like was the case in 2016.

823
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,200
now the new version i think is pretty

824
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,159
backwards compatible

825
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,600
the exception obviously of top clear

826
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,480
and that will take time to adapt to

827
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,000
obviously

828
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,880
and the addition of the opm was strict

829
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,559
but still vmware was already there and

830
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,880
does not change and as people were

831
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,840
already doing dlpm strict but then using

832
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,760
their own words like keep it in your own

833
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,520
organization only

834
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,840
this is now basically codified so i

835
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,360
think that changes

836
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,760
should be quite an easy one

837
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,200
we will also make some training

838
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,960
materials available

839
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,120
and some training material inserts it's

840
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,480
not highly complicated of course what

841
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,880
we're talking about but it's important

842
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,600
that that word gets out there and

843
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,000
continue to work on what dad has been

844
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,080
talking about the use cases

845
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,480
and the cheat sheet and to have as much

846
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,039
as possible available in a very short

847
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,279
time

848
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,960
what did i forget

849
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,440
okay no i don't

850
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,080
um yeah and the six months is hopefully

851
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,679
going to give people enough time to

852
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:40,880
change some of the bad practices that

853
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,799
are going on i'm not going to name names

854
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:43,760
um

855
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,919
but some people that go around using tlp

856
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,760
red as tlp amber because they didn't

857
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,600
trust tlp amber um

858
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,279
we found a few cases that it's like okay

859
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,240
well we're just going to send out

860
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,840
copyright and we're like can i talk

861
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,200
about this to people in my organization

862
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
yeah yeah sure go ahead it's like

863
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,799
why aren't you selling it to amber it's

864
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,559
like well because we don't want you to

865
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,159
send it to anyone else it's like we'll

866
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,000
just go and put a label on it saying

867
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
don't send it to anyone else but so

868
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,200
hopefully

869
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,039
in the six months people can change some

870
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,720
of the habits as well

871
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,840
and that's the key is to make sure

872
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,360
you're actually following

873
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,240
following the standard

874
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,640
my organization has definitely never

875
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
sent anything out that said tlp amber on

876
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,919
it and then immediately followed by a

877
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,760
caveat that basically rendered it tlp

878
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,600
red

879
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,399
that never happened

880
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,600
oh i have a goal that's not on here

881
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,200
i'm going to double the size of the sig

882
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,559
and get more people helping with the

883
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,399
work

884
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,159
so come to our meeting on friday

885
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,000
and uh and join in the fun

886
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,279
i promise we're funnier in real life

887
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,880
and that will of course then be mostly

888
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,480
focusing on the

889
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,120
on the use cases and

890
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,279
the communication the the training

891
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,159
materials etc

892
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,640
and i'm interested in knowing is there a

893
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,039
current iso that

894
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,480
outlines

895
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,039
tlp and do they match up

896
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,760
that's a great question

897
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,720
so iso

898
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,279
27010

899
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,919
apparently has tlp in it

900
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,360
um i have not used my library card at my

901
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,440
agency to go download a copy and like

902
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,120
see exactly where it is

903
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,679
but um but apparently it's in there

904
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,559
and it matches like a 2012 or a 2015

905
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,519
rendition of traffic light protocol and

906
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,760
it will be and uh we're going to have a

907
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,519
friend of ours make sure there's an

908
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,960
update applied

909
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,720
he's a member of he's actually i think

910
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,159
it's it's going to be probably be in

911
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,240
brian who's a member of the sig okay um

912
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,840
which do you see

913
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,960
changing

914
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,399
are

915
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,399
are agreed upon

916
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,440
first agreed upon tlp or the iso or

917
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,799
there's got to be a marriage there

918
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,480
somewhere otherwise

919
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,919
people are going to be doing different

920
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,600
things anyway

921
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,440
i think we uh

922
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,880
the i think

923
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,279
ours stays the way we've written it with

924
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,080
the sig and the iso will be updated to

925
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,000
reflect the changes we've made that

926
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,559
would be great that would be great and

927
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,000
let me know if you need some help with

928
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,720
that i'd be happy to sit on that group

929
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,080
working group

930
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,039
thank you

931
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,600
thank you very much

932
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,200
thank you laurie and

933
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,679
by that we've opened the floor for

934
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,039
alexander

935
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:35,919
is

936
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,640
approaching the mic

937
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,640
thanks a lot for the work and

938
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,240
i will go first for the positive points

939
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,919
i mean you need a lot of challenges that

940
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,840
are quite positive i'm really glad of

941
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,159
the tlp restrict it's a lot of

942
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,399
clarifications for for many of us and so

943
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,120
on

944
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,440
i'm glad to with various changes that

945
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,720
you do and so

946
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,559
on the negative aspect on the tlp clear

947
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,159
i still don't get why you change it but

948
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,000
okay

949
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,559
would you keep tlp white mentioned in

950
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,720
the final document to mention as being

951
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,279
compatible with clp clear or would you

952
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,679
completely remove tlp white from the

953
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,200
official document

954
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,120
and my second question is what is the

955
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,440
relationship with the tlp sig and the

956
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,840
information exchange policy seek which

957
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,200
was defining

958
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,559
sharing policies tools for

959
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,760
materials and so on so i'm just

960
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,360
wondering about those two

961
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,279
and if you are still willing to change

962
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,519
any document or changes into the

963
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,240
official document you plan to publish

964
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,640
or would you keep it like this and

965
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,640
people have to deal with the

966
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,120
mess with tlp-wide changes can i take

967
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,640
the first part of the question you the

968
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,279
second part tom i think he has three

969
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,919
questions oh okay then the second i'll

970
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,519
take i'll take as many as you want me to

971
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,799
okay

972
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,700
so the first part was

973
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,080
[Music]

974
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,640
we will have only to be clear in the new

975
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,960
version but we will keep the top v1 of

976
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,840
course on the first website for for for

977
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,720
reference purposes

978
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,159
second part and it's the second part was

979
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,440
um

980
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,199
uh let's see and you said you didn't

981
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,480
understand why we changed it and the

982
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,199
answer is racism and then the um

983
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,119
the uh the second part yeah go ahead and

984
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,480
remind me

985
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,839
uh

986
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,839
think the information exchange oh the

987
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,679
relationship with iep

988
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,639
um

989
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,800
well just like we've done today i think

990
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,839
we're just going to make sure that the

991
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,918
iep sig meetings are always in you know

992
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,440
like at the same time as tlp sig

993
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,000
meetings so you can't no i'm kidding um

994
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,040
so

995
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,639
uh iep references tlp and it references

996
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,480
the first.org tlp so i suspect the way i

997
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,320
would like to see it go is that iep

998
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,239
which they're hashing out right now what

999
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,320
they're going to do next for iep in

1000
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,359
another room um and i hope to hear about

1001
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,520
that and hear positive things i would

1002
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,679
expect iep to reference tlp 2.0

1003
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,920
going forward then there's a collateral

1004
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,760
question to it how do you represent in

1005
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,920
tlp the versions

1006
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,760
should we prefix versions too for

1007
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,240
example in tlp if some people want still

1008
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,839
to use the older versions i mean

1009
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,520
backward compatibility and stuff like

1010
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,560
that

1011
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,839
right now we don't

1012
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,400
if we say tlp double points

1013
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,119
amber it's still the old one

1014
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,280
um which version is it is it version

1015
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,440
1.1.2

1016
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,880
should we prefix clp2 double point for

1017
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,400
the specifications i'm just wondering

1018
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,720
about machine readable things

1019
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,599
or do you specify the version there

1020
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,760
well um

1021
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,200
taking the example of iep

1022
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,599
so iep points to the url that just says

1023
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,800
first.org

1024
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,720
tlp

1025
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,520
going forward after this conference

1026
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,200
that url is going to take you to 2.0

1027
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,000
so

1028
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,119
anything machine readable and so also i

1029
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,359
think a lot of this relies on the on the

1030
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,119
what i consider to be a fact that a

1031
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,119
great deal of what is shared under tlp

1032
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,280
is very time sensitive information so

1033
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,240
there's not like you know like a whole

1034
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,079
bunch of like really old stale stuff

1035
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,960
under tlp that that it um

1036
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,119
is of great concern

1037
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,960
uh i'm willing to be absolutely

1038
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,560
corrected on that

1039
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,000
um

1040
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,480
and uh so if machine readable

1041
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,480
if it needs to be machine readable

1042
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,560
the machine will follow the url the url

1043
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,280
will present tlp 2.0 and that way

1044
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,640
anybody who is actually trying to

1045
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,720
interpret the uh the the stuff that the

1046
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,400
machine's thrown around

1047
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,079
is going to be reading the up-to-date

1048
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,079
version okay does that help it does that

1049
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,599
help at all answer the question

1050
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,440
partially yes thank you if there needs

1051
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,079
to be if we need to hash out more to do

1052
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,839
with how we mark the specific version

1053
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,079
that something is being shared under

1054
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,599
rather than just simply referencing the

1055
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,280
url which is going to be the most up to

1056
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,079
date

1057
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,119
then um

1058
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,520
then i'm more than uh

1059
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,119
more than happy to welcome anybody to

1060
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,640
join the sig and help us help us get

1061
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,960
that squared away something else a cheat

1062
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,400
sheet is really great

1063
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
just one thing for tlp red

1064
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,240
defense for your organizations it could

1065
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,839
help if you don't do anything or you

1066
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,800
know what to not do so you tlp can be

1067
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,440
useful there

1068
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,720
in

1069
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,160
i think it's really crucial

1070
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,880
i think it's really crucial to confine

1071
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,760
tlp to the scope of how to share things

1072
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,920
and not to get too much into how to act

1073
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,560
on things absolutely yeah

1074
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,800
yeah because that's covered by iep but

1075
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,079
just out on the the tlp red um

1076
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,520
i talked earlier about making sure you

1077
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,839
have a discussion between recipient and

1078
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,400
sender and usually the onus is on on the

1079
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,480
the person providing the information

1080
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,000
out to make sure that the recipient

1081
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,880
understands it with tlp red we say it's

1082
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,880
only the people in the conversation that

1083
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,640
can understand that if you're sharing

1084
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,480
tlp red and we've got to make sure that

1085
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,920
this is in the use cases that if you're

1086
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,920
sharing tv red with someone who has a

1087
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,520
legal obligation

1088
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,720
to provide that information to other

1089
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,000
people in the organization that you

1090
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,760
understand that you go and ask them and

1091
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,359
says if i provide you this information

1092
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,599
do you have a legal obligation or policy

1093
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,440
obligation to provide this to other

1094
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,200
people either in your organization or

1095
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,920
elsewhere and then make sure that you're

1096
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,359
fully informed about that before you

1097
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,480
make that choice to share the

1098
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,560
information so it's really the onus is

1099
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,960
on the producer of information

1100
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,640
as far as backward compatibility i mean

1101
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,320
that was one of the things we really

1102
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,680
made sure

1103
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,040
was in there was the backward

1104
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,400
compatibility so that if you're looking

1105
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,000
at something that says tlpm but it

1106
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,119
really doesn't matter if it's version

1107
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,000
one or version two it's tlp amber um if

1108
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,680
it says tlp clear tlp white you know

1109
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,440
which version you're dealing with if it

1110
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,839
says tlp amp restrict it's either

1111
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,440
somebody who's decided they're going to

1112
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,520
stick that in version one as their own

1113
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,200
edition or it's version two but it all

1114
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,000
means the same we did have an earlier

1115
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,079
try where we're going to try to

1116
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,480
make tlp amber the strict one and have a

1117
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,000
one that was less strict and we realized

1118
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,119
that that's not more backward

1119
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,599
compatibility so

1120
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,960
from a person to person i don't think

1121
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,079
there's too much of a problem for

1122
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,960
backward compatibility on on the right

1123
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,200
interpretation of it yeah exactly

1124
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,800
okay thank you

1125
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,720
okay uh anders if you could wait a

1126
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,000
moment i think it's patrick first

1127
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,320
hello patrick green um

1128
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,520
i'm going to mention something that i'm

1129
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,359
sure you've been fighting with before

1130
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,040
but i've been working with

1131
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,359
national level sharing communities

1132
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,480
and connected cheering communities

1133
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,040
and at that point

1134
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,760
tlp amber gets really quite messy

1135
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,960
because these are

1136
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,960
more than peer lesson organization

1137
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,320
and i'm sure you've wrestled with this a

1138
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,160
number of times but it's on

1139
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,960
two it might even get even more messy

1140
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,920
than on one um they've caused me

1141
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,160
no end of problem but um

1142
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,280
i'm sure you're aware of that i just

1143
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,040
thought i'd bring it up as a thing

1144
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,800
can i speak to that just because one of

1145
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,839
one of the things we did was put a

1146
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,000
definition because i work for a national

1147
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,599
cesar and

1148
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,920
one of this is definitions i think are

1149
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,520
the one difference

1150
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,200
the lack of definitions in version one

1151
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,400
version two

1152
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,160
there was an intent in version one not

1153
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,599
necessarily in version two but if you

1154
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,520
take a look at the if you haven't looked

1155
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,640
at the actual um final uh

1156
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,040
tlp that we sent out

1157
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,319
we've said for clients that for national

1158
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:14,079
c-certs it includes your constituents

1159
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,880
we have not defined constituents

1160
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,680
so

1161
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,599
one of my concerns is that for us

1162
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,359
constituents are people who are

1163
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:22,960
especially on board

1164
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,839
have done some sort of

1165
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,359
we've tested to make sure they

1166
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,040
understand tlp et cetera for another

1167
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,720
national cesar they might not understand

1168
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,760
those kind of things their idea of

1169
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,040
constituents might be the inside of the

1170
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,920
country but tlp amber by default if

1171
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,680
you're a national c-cert gives you the

1172
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,520
right to distribute that to your

1173
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,440
constituents

1174
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,720
yeah i'm not working for a national

1175
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,960
season this is um so if you imagine

1176
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,119
third sector sharing community where

1177
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,680
everyone is vetted into the third sector

1178
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,240
that is then greater than peer

1179
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,200
but less than organization and then they

1180
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,079
can also share to another sharing

1181
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,520
community

1182
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,480
at

1183
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,920
green

1184
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,680
but they can't do it at amber which is

1185
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,680
fine that works but amber to amber and

1186
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,839
it's automated as well so you can't you

1187
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,680
can't necessarily get

1188
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,720
the upfront agreement from the

1189
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,200
originator

1190
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,800
and it just gets

1191
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,480
really quite messy

1192
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,680
because of the

1193
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,079
definitions

1194
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,200
this

1195
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,560
this is one of the things that i had in

1196
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,800
that discussion with tom years ago about

1197
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,640
tlp green was the notion that if you

1198
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,839
said

1199
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,920
if i go and call something tlb amber in

1200
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,800
your example and share it with a

1201
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,440
certain subset of people if anyone is on

1202
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
that say email

1203
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,280
they know who else was on the email if i

1204
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,280
didn't bcc it so you know you can talk

1205
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,960
to those people about it

1206
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,560
but if i sent it out individually you

1207
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,000
don't know who else got that information

1208
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,359
you don't know who else you can talk to

1209
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,520
about that information

1210
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,800
in theory

1211
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,720
if you said if you use a defined

1212
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,839
community for tlp green and say

1213
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,839
let's say tlp green this can go to the

1214
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:05,119
banking sector in the european union

1215
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,880
and maybe the rationale for european

1216
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,119
union is because it's it fits the data

1217
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,560
compliance laws

1218
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,599
um

1219
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,440
if i send this out it means oh i can

1220
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,000
talk to anybody that's in that sector

1221
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,760
you know who you can talk to

1222
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,800
so

1223
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,119
i personally like the idea of a tlp

1224
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,880
green where you

1225
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,680
define a sector and that sector could be

1226
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,200
well not necessarily a sector you define

1227
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,400
a community

1228
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,839
it could be defined by sector could be

1229
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,359
defined by nationality it could be

1230
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:32,560
defined by

1231
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,760
whatever

1232
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,520
and then you know that it's safe to

1233
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,079
share it within that definition but

1234
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,040
that's

1235
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,599
that's not encoded in there but it it's

1236
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,440
sort of one of the things i interpret by

1237
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,240
reading tlp green to a defined community

1238
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,560
we just define by general

1239
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,480
in general when we see tlb green if

1240
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,079
there's nothing else we just say it's

1241
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,839
the cyber community that's what we've

1242
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,160
always assumed one of the risks doing

1243
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,400
that though is you share tlp green

1244
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,680
somebody doesn't read all those little

1245
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,880
caveats and they're like oh it's still

1246
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,079
bigger i'll just share it with somebody

1247
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,280
else so all that can be done in iep

1248
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,200
you can put all that stuff into iep you

1249
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,800
can't do it easily here i mean this is

1250
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,640
much more human readable so i would

1251
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,560
assume from a human perspective read the

1252
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,160
caveat from a machine perspective use

1253
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,680
iep

1254
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,839
oh perhaps i'll catch you afterwards and

1255
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,680
ever go through it with you rather than

1256
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,040
take up the

1257
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,079
stand join the sig yeah

1258
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:24,839
you're

1259
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:29,200
welcome okay andras

1260
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,560
so first of all thanks for all the work

1261
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,839
that you're doing on this especially

1262
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,920
with the clarifications i think it's

1263
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,319
especially solving the dlp amber issues

1264
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,480
are going to be really handy

1265
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,319
i'm still worried about tlp clear

1266
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,720
especially about

1267
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,240
use cases where you have for example

1268
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,640
data guard

1269
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,000
in networks

1270
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,079
that are hard coded looking for tlp

1271
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,640
white to let data pass

1272
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,720
the problem is very often these tools

1273
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,359
have been written by someone ages ago

1274
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:58,720
and they're in place

1275
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,040
so suddenly we'll see a drop of data

1276
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,680
flowing basically data that could be

1277
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,200
absolutely vital to protect

1278
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,599
organizations so that's my biggest fear

1279
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,920
of tlp clear and perhaps uh as a first

1280
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,520
step something for the sick to consider

1281
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,680
would be

1282
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,040
a campaign or or or actually

1283
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,640
perhaps outsourcing

1284
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,760
this task

1285
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,880
of uh

1286
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,839
of running automated scripts updating

1287
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:24,560
all

1288
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,040
code repositories that have uh tlp white

1289
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,200
hard-coded so to put effort into

1290
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,880
actually changing the existing tools

1291
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,720
that are at least available publicly

1292
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,160
so that we we don't run into these

1293
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,079
issues and this drops in data flows but

1294
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,400
if i understand well uh both you and tom

1295
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,920
already have an idea about that would

1296
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,960
you like to

1297
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,640
mention it

1298
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,720
well i mean i don't know exactly how

1299
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,640
serious the conversation was as most

1300
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,400
things with me kind of go

1301
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,560
um but we were

1302
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,200
you brought up the the month of code

1303
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,680
and uh and how many pull requests could

1304
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,440
you generate if you went and looked for

1305
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,280
everything what had had tlp white hard

1306
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,440
coded into it and then just did a pr for

1307
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,839
everything so that it had uh so that it

1308
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,640
changed the tlp clear right and that you

1309
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,480
you you know like that somebody's gonna

1310
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,319
get a free t-shirt and a deal

1311
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,200
um

1312
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,119
well but i think i really like your idea

1313
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,880
of like doing some kind of campaign to

1314
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,640
make sure to raise awareness of this

1315
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,119
particular issue especially within that

1316
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,720
time frame that we've art that we've

1317
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,800
worked with to on with the board to

1318
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,000
agree upon

1319
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,760
so that uh

1320
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,599
so that the word gets out to as many uh

1321
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,599
developers as possible

1322
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,119
i think the issue that you raise about

1323
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,119
the data cards that the data guards that

1324
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,119
are looking for this for um

1325
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,680
for dlp purposes or something like that

1326
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,680
is a is a really important one so thank

1327
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,560
you

1328
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,480
thanks thank you

1329
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,560
yes

1330
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,880
hello

1331
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,920
i was triggered by the third

1332
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,760
mention about use cases so i'm thinking

1333
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,119
about

1334
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,960
two scenarios one scenario is that i

1335
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,960
have a document and it says still be

1336
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,000
read

1337
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,800
and is it clarified somewhere in the

1338
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,200
documents

1339
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,599
what is my expectation because tlp red

1340
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,480
means what i i can do about it but

1341
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,240
instantly i think in my head probably

1342
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,599
it's not known

1343
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,119
but for example don

1344
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,280
tells me something tlp red

1345
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,119
but maybe it's out there public on

1346
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,160
internet

1347
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,280
right so

1348
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,880
when we think about reverse case that

1349
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,640
was presented

1350
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,000
so

1351
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,400
if i get a document which says dlp white

1352
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,920
or clear

1353
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,960
my instant feeling that it's public

1354
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,440
but if i have to because it's about me

1355
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,440
for example right and then i choose to

1356
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,480
share it

1357
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,960
but then i can introduce some confusion

1358
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,480
but actually if it's still py it doesn't

1359
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,480
mean that it's public

1360
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,040
it i am deciding what to do with it

1361
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,119
and there's a mental

1362
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,480
thing which can introduce

1363
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,160
miscommunication because now i can be

1364
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,760
scared or somebody else who doesn't

1365
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,599
understand the difference between

1366
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,240
instructions to me versus availability

1367
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,520
of information

1368
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,920
uh for example my manager you know he

1369
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,839
sees dlp white and says oh it's a public

1370
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,760
document or tlp clear

1371
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,560
so

1372
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,440
do you plan to clarify this aspect on

1373
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,960
especially for this use case what you

1374
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,760
have mentioned thank you

1375
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,240
i was just i was just going to suggest

1376
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,640
while while you were um bringing this up

1377
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,319
i had the idea like maybe it would be

1378
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,040
handy in the in this particular use case

1379
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,200
the victim notification thing which is

1380
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,119
the one you're talking about correct

1381
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,880
or that scenario

1382
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,800
um

1383
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,119
maybe it would be useful to create some

1384
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,839
some generic language or a template

1385
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,640
language so that it could be like a

1386
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,480
basic caveat that would explain why

1387
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,920
you've kind of got the

1388
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,119
tlp amber envelope that contains that

1389
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,280
tlp white information

1390
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,200
and how the how the recipient can behave

1391
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,280
with it because again we want to keep we

1392
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,280
do want to keep tlp scoped to only

1393
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,280
talking about sharing

1394
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,720
um but

1395
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,598
it is um

1396
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,680
it is useful i think in some of the ins

1397
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,119
it will be useful in some of these use

1398
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,599
cases to have more in-depth explanations

1399
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,400
of what the recipients can do yeah in in

1400
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,480
the use cases some of the use cases i've

1401
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,640
put together so far i've put try to put

1402
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,960
an example text and i think this is a

1403
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,359
really good one that probably

1404
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,280
it's not part of the standard

1405
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,400
but

1406
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,160
as an example that you give in a use

1407
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,079
case to go and say in this in condition

1408
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,680
maybe just the wording

1409
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,880
the following

1410
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,280
text

1411
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,359
can be shared at

1412
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,359
this if you so choose

1413
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,200
and then maybe have an end so we can

1414
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,599
work on again join the tlpg we're going

1415
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:42,720
to work on these kind of things in the

1416
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,480
next you know few months to try to give

1417
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,839
this guidance but

1418
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,359
and i encourage everyone here if you've

1419
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,880
got use cases

1420
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,480
send it to the tlp sick even if you

1421
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,240
don't want to join the sake send your

1422
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,160
use cases send your questions to us we

1423
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,680
we need those because i've got my own

1424
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,400
examples where i have problems and

1425
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,319
you know i want to solve them and each

1426
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,960
person has their own unique situation

1427
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,880
so the more we get these these kind of

1428
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,960
examples of real world problems that

1429
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,240
you're having the more we can actually

1430
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,680
go and say

1431
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,520
ah what's the best wording that we can

1432
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,400
use what are some good generic

1433
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,480
words that we can use and then we'll get

1434
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,760
translators to translate them in

1435
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,960
different languages as well because

1436
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,079
something that while tlp is english only

1437
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,440
the instructions and all that you want

1438
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,960
to make sure that people understand it

1439
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,960
so having extra extra language

1440
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,319
translations of those would be good but

1441
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,640
i think it's an excellent point and we

1442
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,400
should definitely be giving that type of

1443
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,800
guidance in the use cases

1444
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,480
i think you meant to say like the the

1445
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,880
markings themselves are primarily in

1446
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,000
english

1447
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,400
yes yeah not the top itself is yeah

1448
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,559
ethiopia yeah and one more remark which

1449
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,319
you reminded me of villius which is

1450
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,559
really important you may not be able to

1451
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,040
read it but i'll read it out just to be

1452
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,119
sure is that what stayed the same and i

1453
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,400
think we even put a little bit more

1454
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,200
emphasis on it that tlp is a simple

1455
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,119
standard right it's it's four colors

1456
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,960
basically and it's a limited set of

1457
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,920
words

1458
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,319
and sometimes we try to solve too many

1459
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,240
problems with just a few words which

1460
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,240
doesn't work so that's why there are a

1461
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,839
few things in bold there at the middle

1462
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,680
of the page which are extremely

1463
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,280
important first of all the source is

1464
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,520
responsible for ensuring that recipients

1465
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,079
of top labeled information understand

1466
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:20,319
and can follow top sharing guidance so

1467
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,319
that one that one remains the source

1468
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,000
must actually know what they do when

1469
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,599
they spread the information

1470
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,280
yes it is harder to apply when it's

1471
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,119
automated exchanges i know but this

1472
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:31,359
stays very important

1473
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,520
number g the source is at liberty to

1474
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,760
specify additional sharing restrictions

1475
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,680
that's still the case these must be

1476
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,000
adhered to by these must be adhered to

1477
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,520
by recipients

1478
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,000
an age if a recipient needs to share

1479
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,400
information more widely

1480
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,640
than indicated by the top label it came

1481
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,640
with they must obtain explicit

1482
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,480
permission permission from the source so

1483
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,599
these very important remarks uh

1484
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,720
stay valid and it stays a human work so

1485
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,440
sometimes tlp just doesn't quite fit and

1486
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,880
we need to be creative in using it

1487
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,920
and yeah as i said earlier explicit

1488
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,000
permission come in three ways one is you

1489
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,839
can actually put it in the information

1490
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,079
saying you can do the following extra

1491
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:15,680
things that are beyond the standard

1492
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,599
number two is you go back to the to the

1493
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:19,280
sender and ask for permission or number

1494
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,599
three is you get a standing agreement

1495
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:24,480
between you and the sender to go and use

1496
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,280
this exception and then the onus is on

1497
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,280
the sender to make sure that anything

1498
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,440
that goes outside of that agreement is

1499
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,480
is identified

1500
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,599
okay

1501
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,760
any other questions i'm sure you have

1502
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,000
comments or questions or suggestions

1503
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,559
that you can come up with

1504
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,400
feel free we have a

1505
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,040
a lot of time left 25 minutes

1506
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,559
minutes okay thank you my name is

1507
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,000
duchess i'm from national assert of the

1508
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,880
republic of serbia thank you for this

1509
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,000
information i have one question uh

1510
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,559
related to tlp red

1511
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,359
so it should the information classified

1512
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,119
as tlp red should be

1513
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:06,319
exchanged

1514
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:09,040
verbally or in person

1515
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,319
so

1516
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:14,000
is there any way that we use for example

1517
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,119
pgp with email to share with some person

1518
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:19,520
information that is classified as dlp

1519
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,720
red

1520
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,118
is this

1521
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,480
a kind of question that is

1522
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,000
stupid question or

1523
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,720
i just wanted to say uh to to ask myself

1524
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,960
what is the way that we could

1525
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,680
by mail exchange dlp red information is

1526
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,880
this possible

1527
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,599
at any kind of encryption

1528
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,920
and so on thank you uh

1529
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,079
it's not a stupid question at all no

1530
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,119
such thing

1531
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:46,640
um

1532
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,319
so the the

1533
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,800
the wording i believe is should

1534
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,119
and that's just a piece of advice

1535
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,160
um my gen my more my other version of

1536
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,760
the advice is basically if you find

1537
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,040
yourself opening something in a

1538
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,040
microsoft office product and you start

1539
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,839
typing the letters tlp red you might be

1540
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,280
doing something wrong

1541
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,400
but

1542
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,280
um

1543
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,800
it does happen all the time and there's

1544
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,720
lots of use cases for it and sometimes

1545
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,480
people share tlp red without any

1546
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,880
encryption at all i've seen

1547
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,000
i am

1548
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,920
i've not only seen i am a member of

1549
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,079
multiple slack channels in some trust

1550
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:21,280
communities where the whole slack

1551
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,280
channel is marked dlp red and people are

1552
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,680
just typing away about whatever the news

1553
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,960
of the day is

1554
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,640
um so you can share tlp red um in a

1555
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,119
variety of media and different types of

1556
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:34,160
channels

1557
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,280
um

1558
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,520
digitally etc it's just um

1559
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,160
it's considered like so there is no must

1560
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,960
be shared in person or you know like or

1561
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,440
sort of manually so as you as you put it

1562
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,040
but uh

1563
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,280
but it's advisable to be sort of

1564
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,119
sensitive about how you do share tlp red

1565
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:57,760
and i would say does that help

1566
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,200
let's say you as the recipient shouldn't

1567
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,640
feel guilty that somebody's gone and

1568
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,640
sent you an email that your system can

1569
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,319
look at i mean the onus is again on the

1570
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:07,280
sender not on you as the recipient so as

1571
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,800
you as a sender

1572
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,480
if you're

1573
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,920
hopefully if you're sending tlp

1574
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,599
information you know that

1575
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,000
the sysadmins and anybody in between is

1576
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:16,800
going to be able to read that

1577
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,240
information and if you're comfortable

1578
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,000
with that and you want to call it tlp

1579
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,480
red well that's on you your tlp red is

1580
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,000
anybody that can is part of the

1581
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,160
conversation and maybe the system is a

1582
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,119
part of that conversation um if you want

1583
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,720
it to really be

1584
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,040
encrypted and send a pgp to someone so

1585
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,960
they open it

1586
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,319
again realizing that person is going to

1587
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:38,799
open it on a computer and sysadmins and

1588
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:39,839
others are going to be able to get

1589
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,599
access to that information

1590
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,920
if you're comfortable with the fact that

1591
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,240
the sysadmins on the other end are going

1592
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,160
to be able to look at that

1593
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,079
then yeah go ahead

1594
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,240
you should until quantum computing we

1595
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,119
should

1596
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,400
realize this asymmetric encryption yes

1597
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,599
yeah yes so it's it's so i'm aware i'm

1598
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,760
ensure that my recipient has

1599
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,040
his private key uh and he's only can

1600
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,520
access this i'm i'm i'm sure that with

1601
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,160
encryption there is no way that someone

1602
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,799
in transit can read that information so

1603
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,040
i'm free to send to share dlp read

1604
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,799
information

1605
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:19,119
to only that recipient is this okay this

1606
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,839
uh yeah end-to-end encryption is great

1607
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,240
okay you should always use best effort

1608
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,839
okay great thank you thank you very much

1609
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:30,480
alexander i know that yeah based on

1610
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,319
based on his feedback i'm i'm not

1611
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,400
struggling with still period

1612
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,319
which is quite interesting um

1613
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,799
there's the program for first

1614
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:41,280
and this talk from inteser

1615
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,960
i think it's tomorrow which is still

1616
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,240
period

1617
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,040
but

1618
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,119
it's here of individual individual

1619
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,760
recipients there so that means a crowd

1620
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,839
of conference of people it's fine so

1621
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:53,040
it's been

1622
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,359
in uh meetings with many people it's

1623
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:58,079
fine to use it as a kind of

1624
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,400
classification scheme but in this case

1625
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,720
it's only for individual recipients so

1626
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,799
i'm lost now

1627
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,280
what did you say like the the talk that

1628
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,359
smart tlp read yes

1629
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:10,799
well i would assume

1630
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,480
that the source of that information the

1631
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,000
presenters

1632
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,160
is intending for everybody in the room

1633
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,680
to keep the contents of that talk to

1634
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,160
themselves

1635
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,440
okay

1636
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,200
yeah

1637
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,400
so we

1638
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,400
as you know we don't rule that and we

1639
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,160
don't want to rule that so probably my

1640
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,000
personal choice would be different i

1641
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
think it is this is my personal comment

1642
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,520
right yeah sure

1643
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,000
i think i would not share anything

1644
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,480
with a very big audience on the tlp red

1645
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,799
because it seems a little unlikely to me

1646
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:43,280
but i assume that the indeed like tom

1647
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,720
said the source of

1648
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,440
or the speaker tomorrow wants to limit

1649
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,280
it as much as possible

1650
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,839
uh but in general i think that the music

1651
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:53,680
you'll be read

1652
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,440
if you are wise and this is again my

1653
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,599
personal comment it is indeed good to

1654
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,040
know who you are actually sharing it

1655
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,160
with exactly that's why i think that the

1656
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,240
word individual recipients is still

1657
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,920
supported so it's more like close

1658
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,079
meeting with like a small number of

1659
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:09,119
people yes okay make sense okay thanks

1660
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,559
amen if

1661
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,799
you need free speaker registration and

1662
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:15,440
all you've got is tlp red information

1663
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,359
do what you got to do

1664
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:18,960
i mean things that i consider is

1665
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,559
legitimate tlp rate that i've seen

1666
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:22,480
before someone coming in talking about a

1667
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,319
specific incident and they may go and

1668
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,799
actually tell me the name of the

1669
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,720
organization that was affected and it's

1670
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:29,839
like i don't want anybody else in your

1671
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:31,119
organization to know this but i'm

1672
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,240
telling you

1673
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,839
because if you see something similar

1674
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:35,359
maybe i'm talking to somebody in another

1675
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:37,760
national season and i'm like

1676
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,160
this is the company that got impacted

1677
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,160
they've got offices or they've got

1678
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,240
something in your country

1679
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,599
i want you to keep an eye out if you

1680
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,040
happen to see anything then you'll know

1681
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,480
it's related you can talk to me and then

1682
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,839
we can start this conversation or

1683
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:51,440
something but if you don't see anything

1684
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,040
i don't want anyone else in your

1685
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,799
organization knowing this i mean those

1686
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:56,400
are that's the kind of example that i

1687
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,119
would typically use for tlp red is is

1688
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:01,280
i've got somebody i trust and i know

1689
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,319
they're not going to go and share this

1690
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,240
information but that information might

1691
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,559
be useful a bit i've also seen it happen

1692
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,799
sometimes when i get tip-offs from from

1693
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:10,799
police about a takedown and they'll go

1694
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:12,160
and tell us and it's like

1695
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,760
they'll tell me so that i make sure that

1696
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,520
i can tell my bosses later on that yeah

1697
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,000
i was informed about this um but they

1698
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,280
don't want me talking about this broadly

1699
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,559
because again that there are

1700
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:22,079
consequences but they just want to give

1701
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,359
me a heads up

1702
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,280
because

1703
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,400
you know they don't want to look like

1704
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,400
they're not sharing but

1705
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,040
it's sensitive

1706
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,680
another example is i use tlp red often

1707
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,520
when i give trainings just to tell a

1708
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,160
story an inside story where i would

1709
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,920
rather not see people use it outside the

1710
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,880
room

1711
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,559
and still it's sensible to you to share

1712
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,480
it because it's just an interesting

1713
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,000
piece of information so there you can

1714
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,799
also use top red

1715
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,200
yes

1716
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,240
welcome

1717
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,000
tom you're

1718
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,839
probably double this a lot at you a

1719
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:01,920
certain system but is it possible that

1720
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,599
you could see the use of multiple tlps

1721
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,839
and a single one where it's like

1722
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:10,240
something's tlp amber but if you want

1723
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,920
people to

1724
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,680
use actionable

1725
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,520
stuff to share with the people who are

1726
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,359
going to be doing the grunt work you can

1727
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:20,240
make it plp green

1728
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,558
um

1729
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:24,799
as you're asking this i'm imagining

1730
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,880
something more like uh like what we call

1731
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,520
paragraph markings

1732
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,359
in uh in certain communities where we

1733
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,359
say like this you know

1734
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,040
this pair like for example like this

1735
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,559
part of the message is tlp and restrict

1736
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:40,559
and this part of the message is tlp

1737
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:41,760
green

1738
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,640
yeah

1739
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,720
yeah because that is actually like that

1740
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,160
is another one of the use cases in

1741
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,599
progress

1742
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:50,640
to get clear language on how to use

1743
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:51,680
um

1744
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,480
multiple tlps in the same

1745
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,960
uh in the same context

1746
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,799
and it kind of sounds interestingly

1747
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:00,400
enough you just heard don admit that he

1748
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,319
does that on a regular basis when he

1749
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:04,799
gives a training he will have the

1750
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,040
training probably is tlp green

1751
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,280
for the most part and then it contains

1752
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,319
tidbits that are tlp red

1753
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:14,160
so it's already something that some

1754
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,760
people are doing in fact i think there's

1755
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,240
some sharing organizations that do this

1756
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,200
um

1757
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,799
but uh but it is something that's not

1758
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,480
codified or

1759
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,880
um or clearly explained in the standard

1760
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,799
and probably in some sort of appendix or

1761
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:28,319
the use case document that we're talking

1762
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:29,200
about

1763
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,799
um we want to include something like

1764
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:32,000
that for sure

1765
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,200
yeah in in

1766
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,119
the work we do typically in the

1767
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:36,880
classified environment use either

1768
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,200
paragraph markings or tear lines

1769
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,280
so again paragraph markings is like this

1770
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,799
paragraph is this this paragraph is

1771
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:44,079
you're very explicit sometimes the

1772
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:45,760
tearline is

1773
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,920
yeah this part below is tlp clear this

1774
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,079
part is is tlp green tlp amber

1775
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:53,760
in one of the use cases that i was

1776
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,040
working on for um incident notification

1777
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,799
i had an example where let's say it's

1778
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:01,520
it's a company in thailand discovers

1779
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:04,240
that there's uh

1780
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:07,520
they've been compromised and one of the

1781
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,280
beacons is going to a hospital in

1782
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:13,440
germany well they may send a tlp amber

1783
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,839
strict notification to

1784
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,119
tycert

1785
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:18,079
and then

1786
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:19,839
in that you would have a paragraph that

1787
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:22,240
would be tlp amber strict saying

1788
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,559
please do not um

1789
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,640
identify that it's our company that's

1790
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,240
affected and then tlp clear

1791
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,960
here's the beacon information

1792
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,400
so as far as they're concerned they

1793
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,880
don't care if they get published online

1794
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,240
once it goes to the recipient this is

1795
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,480
what i was talking about end recipients

1796
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,880
right to do what they want at a minimum

1797
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,200
level says this can be shared at tlb

1798
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,280
clear and it's the beacon information

1799
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,960
that goes forward and so tyser would

1800
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,960
only share the tlp clear stuff because

1801
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,040
the rest was tlm restrict they said okay

1802
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,839
i'm going to pass this to sir bund

1803
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,599
and surfbond only gets the clear stuff

1804
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:58,960
and they can send that off to the

1805
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,960
hospital so yeah you can you can have

1806
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,280
tear lines paragraph markings yeah the

1807
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,079
ic tear line classification the little

1808
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,280
genesis of my question

1809
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,200
and training everybody who works for all

1810
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,880
of your organizations on how to do all

1811
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,160
of these things we're talking about will

1812
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,280
only take 10 minutes i promise

1813
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,960
yeah well one x-ray mark when you do the

1814
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,680
embedding

1815
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,920
be very careful i recently saw an

1816
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,839
example of somebody sending out the top

1817
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:27,119
green email

1818
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,160
fine

1819
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,920
and then hidden in in there somewhere

1820
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,319
was a top red passage

1821
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:34,160
you can do that but remember that you as

1822
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,000
a source is responsible for how this is

1823
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
being used chance is of course very big

1824
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,839
that people will just forward it without

1825
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:42,720
having read everything and

1826
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,400
maybe the top rat was not meant to be

1827
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,240
forwarded so when you do embedding be

1828
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:48,400
very clear about what you're

1829
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,520
communicating and how you're

1830
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,200
communicating it we can't put this in

1831
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,119
the standard but this is just

1832
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:54,799
common sense

1833
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:56,240
so you're saying the subject line was

1834
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,400
tlp green and then inside of the email

1835
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,160
body of the email there was that hurts

1836
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,079
me yeah the message should always be the

1837
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:04,960
most sensitive level of tlp regardless

1838
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,319
of the content and then you can if you

1839
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:07,760
want to have bits and pieces you can

1840
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,520
pull out that's fine but yeah

1841
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,520
but again that's that's on the sender as

1842
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,200
the recipient you know you get it and

1843
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,160
you're like oh my god they shouldn't

1844
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,680
have sent that and

1845
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,680
it's not your fault it's it's the center

1846
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,280
it's always the sender has to make sure

1847
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,240
that

1848
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,000
their information is going to be well

1849
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,520
understood by the people receiving it

1850
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,400
any other questions or remarks

1851
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,039
suggestions

1852
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,839
doesn't seem so but

1853
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:38,319
maybe the gentleman in the panel has a

1854
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:40,400
closing remarks

1855
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,160

1856
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,520

1863
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,839
already saw at the table because it's

1864
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:02,079
not spectacular but uh quite nice that

1865

or also

1867
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,839
which is just a little progress but

1868
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:10,480
