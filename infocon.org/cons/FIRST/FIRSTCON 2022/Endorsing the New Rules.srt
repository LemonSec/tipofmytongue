few board members that i did not infect

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,360
with covid uh earlier this year

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,280

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,620
thank you

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,920
[Applause]

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,560
it's my pleasure being here with you uh

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,360
the first time i discussed this type of

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,640
you know

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,200
bridge between the technical community

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,439
and the un and what's happening

33
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,960
internationally when it comes to setting

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,280
up norms and rules that was ten years

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,159
ago

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,159
and while i was it was quite lonely uh

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,159
because i mean we come from a technical

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,560
background and we don't usually engage

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,439
with

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,840
you know intergovernmental organizations

41
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,680
unless we have to

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,439
and i had to

43
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,079
ten years ago i was appointed to join

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,000
one of the you know distinguished groups

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,600
at the u.n a group of diplomats working

46
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,200
on norms

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,640
uh developing norms and uh i'll give you

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,640
some background about this but i more

49
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,600
importantly i i'd like to share with you

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,920
the experiences that i had

51
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,960
in the engagement how we started off

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,200
from kind of

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,840
separate points of view if i may use the

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,880
term

55
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,680
then there is convergence and and what

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,479
we reached was by consensus and and i've

57
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,319
learned quite a few things while working

58
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,239
with those groups over the years

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,239
and i

60
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,080
really made a lot of friends

61
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,760
there so

62
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,239
this talk actually is a result of

63
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,760
cooperation with

64
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,840
my dear colleague martin van hornbick

65
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,800
who was not able to join us

66
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,440
i am actually wearing an academic hat

67
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,959
however for the past 25 years i've

68
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,519
worked in different positions

69
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,959
advising and implementing initiatives

70
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,480
in cyber security pki

71
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,640
digital signatures working with

72
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,800
international organizations as well as

73
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,480
you know regional organizations

74
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,400
i'm a member of the african union cyber

75
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,200
security expert group uh currently i'm

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,120
in the us so i

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,560
will share with you some of the

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,959
experiences that i came across

79
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,959
uh throughout my professional career

80
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,080
here cyber norms that's a term that

81
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,560
actually evolved over the last maybe

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,080
15 20 years

83
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,360
um

84
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,000
and and you know the best place to learn

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,560
about this is from you know groups who

86
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,640
have been developing norms for other

87
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,760
purposes

88
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,040
to me it was

89
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,159
for ict and ict users

90
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,440
and

91
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,480
as it's mentioned here the gold standard

92
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,640
for such norms

93
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,720
lie in the u.n group of governmental

94
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,760
experts that was formed under the un

95
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,319
um i'll give you some background on that

96
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,599
group uh actually there are six groups

97
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,239
of that name that over the years that

98
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,360
were formed

99
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,920
also more recently there is another

100
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,519
group which is very open i'd like to

101
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,680
draw your attention to it and

102
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,959
to share with you uh opportunities uh of

103
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,959
engagement with those groups and with

104
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,519
the work done

105
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,400
oh

106
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,040
you're nge an open-ended working group

107
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,360
uh the work with ungge uh you know

108
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,040
starts

109
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,720
and is hosted by

110
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,840
the un

111
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,239
first committee

112
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,160
you know from the name it's the first

113
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,000
committee and it's the committee that

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,478
deal with this armament

115
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,759
so

116
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,280
to know about a little bit about the

117
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,240
history

118
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,800
disarmament means that they worked on

119
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,040
issues such groups worked on issues on

120
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,360
your weapons of mass destruction

121
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,120
and when i

122
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,800
was

123
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,600
invited nominated to join the group in

124
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,560
2012 2013 i realized you know

125
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
the immense pressure and that in this

126
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,520
case icts was you know

127
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,960
seen and

128
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,320
as as you know along the threat

129
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,120
uh

130
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,080
you know

131
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,440
environment

132
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,360
for international peace

133
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,680
so and and they are drawing on expertise

134
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
from across the world i was

135
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,000
among a group of 15

136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,120
members

137
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,639
i was

138
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,479
the only non-diplomat

139
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,160
among the group

140
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,160
the only one from africa and the middle

141
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,280
east

142
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,720
and uh

143
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,960
if i see someone from latin america

144
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,280
there was just one from latin america so

145
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,320
you have

146
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,800
roughly speaking about 90 countries with

147
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,000
two representatives among 15.

148
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,680
but anyway

149
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,639
i worked my way through this process

150
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,240
i will share with you some of the

151
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,560
outcomes but part of the process is to

152
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,440
engage and to discuss as i said i was

153
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,520
the only non-diplomat

154
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,680
the groups involved a lot of expertise

155
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,479
diplomats international law experts

156
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,960
people working national security

157
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,400
and actually

158
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,919
there were like a couple of diplomats

159
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,919
with ict background

160
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,080
it's important to give you this you know

161
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
background information

162
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,880
because in our discussions you know what

163
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,080
usually

164
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,960
they start off with is text that was

165
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,560
used to deal with weapons of mass

166
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,280
destruction in other areas

167
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,120
and they try to use similar things for

168
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,960
icts

169
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,000
and you know you can imagine

170
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
we had some

171
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,680
fundamental disagreements on some of the

172
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,120
articles

173
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,840
and the point here is to engage to

174
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,080
understand their points of view and to

175
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,440
communicate

176
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,639
what i believe is you know

177
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,400
an ict based

178
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,680
point of view

179
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,160
and i was surprised i've learned a lot

180
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,639
from their points of view and also

181
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,240
i was able to

182
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,720
negotiate and build consensus among

183
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,800
removing some of those articles from the

184
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,919
text altogether so you'll not see it

185
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,680
and because it's not relevant

186
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,600
jurisdiction is totally different if you

187
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,160
are talking about kinetic attacks

188
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,759
you know real physical you know

189
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,280
engagements or engagement in cyberspace

190
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
if you are talking about proportionality

191
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,599
this is a concept that they have so

192
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,599
what's proportionate if

193
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,960
you try to

194
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,199
carry you know analogies from the

195
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,840
physical world and to try to see what

196
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,280
would be a proportionate attack on ict

197
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,800
infrastructure

198
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
you i mean if someone attacks with

199
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,960
malicious software you know how it will

200
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,199
propagate will it show up

201
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,440
unlike in canada queer so we cannot

202
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,000
really use the same text

203
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,880
uh and i've learned you know

204
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,720
that that for instance some countries at

205
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,360
that point in time didn't you know

206
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,960
appreciate and didn't you know

207
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,080
understand

208
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,639
the relevance of using the term cyber

209
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,599
as opposed to information security

210
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,160
fortunately i've worked on both sides

211
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,160
and i made a strong point i mean we we

212
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,039
are doing cyber we're doing you know

213
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,039
protection of infrastructure protection

214
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,080
of systems rather than getting into

215
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,080
data and categorization of data and

216
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,599
protection of data it's not it's very

217
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,879
important topic

218
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,639
but it's very elaborate

219
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,400
so there are overlapping areas that we

220
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,319
need to address and we need to be

221
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,800
careful not so as not to be drifted from

222
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,639
the main purpose of incident responders

223
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,000
so among the six ungge

224
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,680
committees that were

225
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,879
convened starting from 2004

226
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,520
up to the last one which concluded its

227
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,919
work in 2021

228
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,440
there are four reports

229
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,599
four committees reached agreement by

230
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,240
consensus the way the process works

231
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,719
we reach the reports by consensus which

232
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,559
is sometimes challenging because some

233
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,360
committees fail to do this

234
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,519
then it gets sent to the secretary

235
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,559
general of the un and up to the general

236
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,720
assembly of the u.n so the reports that

237
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,320
you see here were

238
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,640
finally endorsed by the full membership

239
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,839
of the un

240
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,040
so although those are uh none

241
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,640
again that these are technical terms

242
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
non-binding norms this is not a

243
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,920
convention

244
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,160
however

245
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,240
190 something countries agreed on you

246
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,480
know the applicability of those norms so

247
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,399
this is a great starting point for all

248
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,720
of us uh

249
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,120
among the the issues that i lobbied for

250
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,320
um

251
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,040
the ungge is governmental experts we

252
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
lobbied to expand we

253
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,760
at the gge invited i was representing my

254
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,200
home country egypt at that point in time

255
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,160
and we expanded the scope by you know

256
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,480
endorsing the creation of what became

257
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,480
afterwards the open-ended working group

258
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,240
which is open to non-governmental

259
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,080
organizations we're open to the private

260
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,040
sector

261
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,880
and the first one was started in 2019

262
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,640
actually if you see the top

263
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,200
left corner here i was invited in the

264
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,680
opening sessions of the open-ended

265
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,040
working group

266
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,600
which was led by distinguished swiss

267
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,959
diplomat

268
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,720
to talk about capacity building in

269
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,320
cyberspace

270
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,720
and you will see when we navigate

271
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
through the text

272
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,240
that for instance

273
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,640
there is a lot for us to do

274
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,560
a lot expected from the international

275
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,240
community

276
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,959
to add in terms of value

277
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,399
so so

278
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,000
that open-ended working group is open

279
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,360
for all of us

280
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,600
and in different capacities whether you

281
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,079
are engaged with an ngo engage with a

282
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,200
company

283
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,279
work for government

284
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,880
everybody is in

285
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
i had you know

286
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,720
some professional concerns that the

287
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,079
first ungge uh i mean recommending the

288
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,320
open-ended working group that this will

289
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,880
go through it went through i had concern

290
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,320
whether the open-ended working group

291
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,440
will end up with a consensus report

292
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,640
i'm really happy to report that this

293
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,720
happened and thanks to really

294
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,959
distinguished you know chairmanship but

295
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,760
also participation from various you know

296
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,040
uh

297
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,040
levels government and government and so

298
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,360
on so this is something to i mean that

299
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,680
we are continuing now with another

300
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,519
engagement another open-ended working

301
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,079
group was started in 2021 at 2020 with a

302
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,600
term up to 20 25 five-year term

303
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,519
i strongly encourage that you engage

304
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,600
with them

305
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,800
now the composition as i said

306
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,920
since we lobbied in 2012 2013 for

307
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,600
expanding the ungge group 15 members

308
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,839
from or across the globe is not enough

309
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,560
it was expanded to 25 members so the

310
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,880
last ungge included

311
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,279
four representatives from africa several

312
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,000
from latin america and from across the

313
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,959
world so inclusion is really important

314
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,760
many of my colleagues from africa from

315
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,519
the middle east from

316
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,079
latin america contributed significantly

317
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,320
in addition of course to

318
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,120
experts and diplomats and we were seeing

319
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,600
now within that group

320
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,399
many

321
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,040
diplomats are now with ict backgrounds

322
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,959
so it's easier to dig deeper and to

323
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,920
discuss in more you know details what

324
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,000
needs to happen the open-ended working

325
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,200
group is

326
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,839
obviously open

327
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,360
so to share with you the famous 11 norms

328
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,639
that were part of the report of the

329
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,639
2015

330
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,040
ungge report

331
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,920
to give you an idea about really some uh

332
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,120
you know the implications of the texts

333
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,040
uh and those norms

334
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,360
those norms are and principles are for

335
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,000
responsible state behavior

336
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,839
this is not just for government this is

337
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,839
for everybody this is for the globe this

338
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,800
is endorsed by the un general assembly

339
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,440
it applies to all of us and it's really

340
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,079
it represents a great starting point for

341
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,680
us if you want to engage in the

342
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,480
community at all levels you'll see here

343
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
some of the norms about

344
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,639
what states should do and what states

345
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,320
should not do

346
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,200
so in terms of sharing knowledge uh

347
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,560
working together partnership

348
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,800
this is reflected in you know the

349
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,600
highlighted green text

350
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,079
on the other side also what states

351
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,320
should abstain from doing

352
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,639
and try to prevent usage of their

353
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,279
infrastructure in launching attacks on

354
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,360
or illicit use of icts

355
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,600
you'll see also

356
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,839
some mention of the international law

357
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,519
its applicability

358
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,399
uh

359
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,720
it was difficult for me to spend like

360
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,360
eight working days to understand the

361
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,440
arguments where some of the members of

362
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,040
the gge

363
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,519
argued why should international be

364
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,720
applied

365
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,240
other members didn't think that it

366
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,880
should be relevant

367
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,160
anyway that was settled in 2013. this is

368
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,399
really important because i studied about

369
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,240
international law a little bit

370
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,160
and it's really a great base to start

371
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,240
when it comes to regulations and we can

372
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,079
go back to the usage of the

373
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,320
international law i strongly encourage

374
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,079
if you are involved in enforcement

375
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,440
enforcing you know uh measures

376
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,320
regulations in ict that you reach out to

377
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,240
a legal expert in your organization to

378
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,000
know more about you know

379
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,320
those norms how they apply how can you

380
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,399
make use of them in you know conveying

381
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,120
your message there are different

382
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,279
measures that are included here in

383
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,360
including attribution

384
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,160
attribution in again the physical world

385
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,760
is is kind of

386
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,000
straightforward the human kind i mean

387
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,519
the mankind

388
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,240
we did this over years for centuries

389
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,680
uh however attribution in ict

390
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,440
is not that obvious

391
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,560
we see

392
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,360
you know proxy actors we see

393
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,880
a lot of

394
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,600
anonymized you know traffic

395
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,480
and

396
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,600
as such

397
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,000
we should act accordingly when it comes

398
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,680
to responsibilities of states

399
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,519
responsibilities of

400
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,160
uh you know key actors key stakeholders

401
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,480
even from the private sector because i

402
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,199
mean

403
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,399
we know about men in the middle attack

404
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,199
and we know that sometimes

405
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,120
an obvious

406
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,360
you know

407
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,760
quote-unquote enemy

408
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,959
adversary

409
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,040
could not be the right one it just could

410
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,959
be men in the middle attack we have seen

411
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,800
in the keynote speech at the beginning

412
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,440
of this conference how someone was made

413
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,839
to look like as if they are

414
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,800
the child abusers and then suddenly it

415
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,480
became some other person and this is

416
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,440
individual in terms of states if you

417
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,759
watch you know

418
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,079
some of the thrillers the

419
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,759
james bond movies

420
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,720
from the 1960s 70s you can see easily i

421
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,440
mean

422
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,199
there are groups that play around

423
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,839
creating hostility between two countries

424
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,560
uh and and in powering this or

425
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,600
increasing that hostility by engaging

426
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,680
in you know organization in the middle

427
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,880
attack

428
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,959
we need to be careful we need to also

429
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,560
guide uh

430
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,000
our organizations our countries to be uh

431
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,920
you know looking for not just the

432
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,399
obvious enemy but what's behind it what

433
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,440
are the motivations uh we cannot do this

434
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,360
we cannot be first responders when it

435
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,519
comes to that type of intelligence we

436
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,920
are not trained to do this

437
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,560
we might be uh you know supporting

438
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,959
whoever is doing this and this is where

439
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,560
i mean it's really important when it

440
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,320
comes to implementing those norms to

441
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,120
know where we fit where we add value and

442
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,800
where we have to reach out and to

443
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,240
support others

444
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,040
like today's you know panel about cyber

445
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,000
crime

446
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,639
i've been you know in different you know

447
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,480
forests talking about cyber crime

448
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,959
engaging with the interpol with the nato

449
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,600
uh conference and other activities

450
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,079
i take a second seat never

451
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,000
a first seat

452
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,920
for a simple reason this is not my i'm

453
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,560
not part of law enforcement uh so so

454
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,880
that's why when when we focus on our

455
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,680
role we add value and at the same time

456
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,000
this is to me is you know fruitful

457
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,399
partnership

458
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,119
then uh aside from the norm so that

459
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,359
tricky part i mean we have norms you can

460
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,439
always anyone can think about those

461
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,520
norms and think about oh well i can come

462
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,880
up with you know additional norms

463
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,839
to me

464
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,760
going through the discussions

465
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,079
this is a lifetime achievement if we are

466
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,839
able to implement those norms the point

467
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,319
is not coming up with you know

468
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,520
nerdy text or some you know attractive

469
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,919
you know phrases how to implement them

470
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,919
how to make this part of a country's

471
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,880
policy or a regional policy it it

472
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,120
requires a lot of changes you know

473
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,840
definitely uh ned will not allow me time

474
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,240
to talk about about this in extensive

475
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,039
you know uh form because this will take

476
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,760
probably the rest of the day at least

477
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,600
lots of details we are talking about

478
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,840
multi-stakeholder approach which is not

479
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,799
a nice

480
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,280
in my view not a nice to have thing it's

481
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,679
an essential for the success of

482
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,400
implementation of norms so when i engage

483
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,720
with other you know stakeholders it is

484
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,600
not

485
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,160
just a nice privilege to have but this

486
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,039
is the way to go and it is not easy

487
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,880
to work it through when it comes to

488
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,400
implementations because we come from

489
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,840
different backgrounds we need to

490
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,520
understand the language

491
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,840
i've made a lot of friends among

492
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,679
diplomatic circles from international

493
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,440
law circles circuits from law

494
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,520
enforcement circuits but you know it

495
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,240
took a lot of time to build trust and to

496
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,640
have meaningful working relationship it

497
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,559
is well worth it well worth the

498
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,160
investment of energy and time to do this

499
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,360
uh in terms of norms also to support the

500
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,200
implementation of any norms that you

501
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,559
come up with

502
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,640
we need to have confidence and trust

503
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,600
i think among the few professionals who

504
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,679
know about the value of trust and

505
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,000
confidence is the incidence responders

506
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,480
you us

507
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,960
so we know that we cannot build trust

508
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,600
and confidence during a crisis time

509
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,280
you know you have an emergency you're

510
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,559
not you know

511
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,760
uh

512
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,679
you know at least to try to build trust

513
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,840
it has to be done ahead of time

514
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,720
and

515
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,679
our certs our c-certs uh incident

516
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,480
responders across the globe they know

517
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,600
how to do this

518
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,679
first is a great forum

519
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,039
to empower you know such networking

520
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,080
across

521
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,000
and throughout my work with the gge or

522
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
open-ended working group

523
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,160
the only you know

524
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,240
organization or profession that was

525
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,320
mentioned over and over again

526
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,720
with unanimous consensus

527
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,799
that they have are all to play

528
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,360
as instance responders and seasons you

529
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,600
will find it's it's in the text

530
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,720
several references to the role of

531
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,919
c-suits

532
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:48,720
so

533
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,360
this is us so here

534
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,960
the whole international community is

535
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,160
looking for us

536
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,240
to support and to help

537
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,720
starting from sharing basic information

538
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,000
about who's who

539
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,280
what can we do

540
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,440
how can we help

541
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,600
what is available in terms of capacity

542
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,280
building how can we help other

543
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,679
organizations

544
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,600
this is really very pragmatic down to

545
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,120
earth

546
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,280
i can navigate through this quickly but

547
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,799
you see here from the confidence

548
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,120
building measures and i'm quoting from

549
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,480
the ungge reports

550
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,159
they define the role for national

551
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,280
seasons they define you know significant

552
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,919
role for regional cooperation

553
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,000
international cooperation this is us

554
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,120
this is here this is first uh

555
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,159
as i i cannot over emphasize it

556
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,840
i've enjoyed being there

557
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,159
and i've enjoyed really hearing about

558
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,679
how the international community the

559
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,080
diplomats the international lawyers

560
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,880
government representatives see us

561
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,760
and look forward for our input

562
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,120
uh you'll see this is more recent so uh

563
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,320
aside from the initial you know norms uh

564
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,159
that you might have heard of and from

565
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,720
2015 this is from the 2021 report again

566
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,480
cooperation and regional

567
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,480
at the regional international level is

568
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,960
mentioned and certs and seasons are

569
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,480
mentioned

570
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,360
in this regard

571
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,320
not supporting you know

572
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,440
offensive

573
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,640
uh work and this is you know

574
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,799
a very important and sensitive

575
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,840
topic

576
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,799
i've heard in some discussions uh in one

577
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,880
of the conferences organized by the

578
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,480
organization for economic cooperation

579
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,360
and development the oecd

580
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,679
some of peop i mean experts coming from

581
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,760
a technical background defending the

582
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,799
view of hacking back

583
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,159
well it might look cool for some to hack

584
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,480
back and of course for companies that

585
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,799
were subjected to a serious attack they

586
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,280
lost assets

587
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,760
they feel that they can do it

588
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,640
i definitely personally professionally

589
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,960
i'm against this hundred percent

590
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,720
for a very simple reason we don't have

591
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,159
all the information

592
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,000
no one has the all the information and

593
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,320
there are channels to do this

594
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,640
there are diplomatic channels there are

595
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
you know channels through the interpol

596
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,080
law enforcement

597
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,440
where we can

598
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,320
you know pursue criminals and and you

599
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,280
know uh punish them by trying them in

600
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,400
front of a court of law and you know

601
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,640
stopping them from causing harm

602
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,919
never gonna work if it's gonna hack back

603
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:30,799
you know

604
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,159
so that's again my view uh also engaging

605
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,360
sea certs

606
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,400
and uh or weaponizing sea certs that's

607
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,520
something which is you know very timely

608
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,400
uh

609
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,880
sea surge should be seen as firefighters

610
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,640
you know uh we shouldn't be seen as part

611
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,360
of you know an offensive

612
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,679
capabilities of a country

613
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,440
there are many sides of it i'm happy to

614
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,520
discuss this you know again because of

615
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,640
where i'm running out of time here

616
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,039
but there are reasons for us to try to

617
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,480
stick to what our main responsibility is

618
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,880
our responsibilities are actually and

619
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,960
and to make sure that we are there to

620
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,000
defend

621
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,600
you know uh our you know society at i

622
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,240
mean a national level at i mean regional

623
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,200
level at the global level to have safer

624
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,960
cyberspace

625
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,559
when it comes to critical infrastructure

626
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,720
we have seen you know and throughout you

627
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,200
know our experiences and discussed again

628
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,440
in this conference how you know attacks

629
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,760
on infrastructure can be very devastated

630
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,000
devastating for countries we've seen the

631
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,880
presentation from ukraine yesterday as

632
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,520
as well as you know prior experiences uh

633
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,960
in different regions

634
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,799
it is something that we need to focus on

635
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,080
and again partnership is really

636
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,159
important because i mean you have the

637
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,720
operators you have it's the private

638
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,080
sector who operate most of the

639
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,000
infrastructure across the globe so we

640
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,240
need to find formulas to work with them

641
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,840
it's quite challenging i come from an

642
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,679
i.t background however i have a degree

643
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,600
in industrial engineering so i know

644
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,919
really the dealing with scatter systems

645
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,600
and you know uh

646
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,240
ics systems and so forth is not as

647
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,840
dealing with a computer that you can

648
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,400
shot or reboot every now and then they

649
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,240
don't reboot utility power you know

650
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,159
controllers every now and then this is a

651
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,559
nightmare for them so so anyway we need

652
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,679
to be open understand work with them and

653
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,640
reach you know a formula for cooperation

654
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,919
you'll see again here in the green text

655
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,159
about cooperation how c-certs are

656
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,240
relevant we are relevant we are seen as

657
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,720
relevant

658
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,120
confidence building measures are really

659
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,799
important so whenever you see this

660
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,400
discussed i've participated in the igf

661
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,039
discussions i'm happy that we have

662
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,799
discussions we have at least another

663
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,679
talk on norms and cbms throughout the

664
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,440
conference

665
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,360
take you know advantage of this and

666
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,400
engage

667
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,960
i have colleagues from brazil who engage

668
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,120
with their you know representatives in

669
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,000
the ungge colleagues for mauritius

670
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
actually the the head of the mauritius

671
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,799
cert

672
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,200
from africa is the representative was

673
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,840
the representative in the last ungge

674
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,320
uh we have the kenya representative who

675
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,640
made she made an excellent

676
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,240
uh participation in the the ungge that

677
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,880
produced the norms that we also

678
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,760
uh it's from all corners of the world i

679
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,120
think it's really important to have

680
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,080
professionals engage with diplomats to

681
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,159
make sure that you know whatever we

682
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,919
reach in terms of text

683
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,600
in terms of directions

684
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,039
makes sense and is applicable

685
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,919
so partnership

686
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,880
from first point of view we try to build

687
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,840
you know

688
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,080
uh common understanding

689
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,000
uh set priorities

690
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,919
try to communicate those priorities to

691
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,200
all the force

692
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,720
so there are different you know

693
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,960
attempts at doing this over the years

694
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,960
there were informal conversations with

695
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,400
the onge

696
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,640
groups as well as the open-ended working

697
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,240
group

698
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,240
we worked with other organizations in

699
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,919
the civil society professional

700
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,799
associations ngos

701
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,679
we emphasize inclusion and partnership

702
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,559
this is key this is again not

703
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,640
done necessarily for diplomatic purposes

704
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,360
here but it's for realistic view we need

705
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,279
to have this we need to have inclusion

706
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,919
we need to have openness

707
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,240
and and this is our only hope

708
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,120
uh

709
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,799
capacity building

710
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,960
this is kind of important

711
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,960
when it comes to this relevant but it is

712
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,640
far more important for us to believe

713
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,039
that capacity building is you know our

714
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,039
most valuable

715
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,000
asset

716
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
in fighting against you know threats or

717
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,400
challenges on cyber security

718
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,039
that's why again

719
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,039
i highlight for first that we

720
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,279
established you know a permanent

721
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,360
position a full-time position

722
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,679
for a capacity building and community

723
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,279
building you know director within first

724
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,200
we hope that we reach out to all of you

725
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
and you reach out to

726
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,120
clay who's taking this

727
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,400
position it's up to us to make it happen

728
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,240
up to us to empower

729
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,600
all certs all incident responders

730
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,960
uh piscerts c-series

731
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,279
even if an organization doesn't have you

732
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,880
know a c-series over a pizza but they

733
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,559
have instant responders

734
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,399
we reach out to them we make sure that

735
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,080
we support them

736
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,760
at the high level when it comes to

737
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,399
decision makers and this is sometimes

738
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,600
quite challenging we need also to have

739
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,440
some sort of

740
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,200
empowerment to decision makers to

741
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,360
understand about the real issues to

742
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,039
understand about the solutions to

743
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,840
understand about you know the spread and

744
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,640
the diversity of our problems we will

745
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,320
not get resources we will not get

746
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,399
support unless we do this it's a lot of

747
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,279
hard work it's taking us out of our

748
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,039
sometimes comfort zone

749
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,200
but this is necessary to do and that's

750
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,880
what we are doing here

751
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,320
yeah

752
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
among our points of view among our

753
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,880
strength really as an organization as a

754
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,320
community

755
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,159
we have essex

756
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,360
first

757
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,559
initiative and we have this you know

758
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,279
i mean as a background of what we stand

759
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,600
for what we highlight

760
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,480
we also develop tlp

761
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,480
the traffic light protocol and we're

762
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,159
using it efficiently in our conference

763
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,440
obviously

764
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,600
we need also in the text and

765
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,919
governmental and international documents

766
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,039
to talk to us using tlp because

767
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,679
sometimes when they say you cannot

768
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,279
you know when it comes to sanctions and

769
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,880
export control you cannot talk about

770
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,440
technology

771
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,640
oh well

772
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,279
if i'm exchanging my card with my email

773
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,240
is that technology

774
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,679
everything has technology with iot

775
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,279
technology is everywhere so we know

776
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,120
the more efficient way is to go through

777
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,240
classifying information that i know when

778
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,760
it is public

779
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,039
information

780
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,039
really i mean it's ridiculous to talk

781
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,320
about you know

782
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,240
controls over something which is public

783
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,120
essentially uh and and that's why

784
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,840
you know having this type of trajectory

785
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,080
of where we are where we need to be

786
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,480
uh is really important to set priorities

787
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,039
if we have tlp applied in all you know

788
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,880
the text coming from you know

789
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,840
various uh regulatory uh you know

790
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,799
ascension organizations and so forth

791
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,320
it is something that we relate to we

792
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,960
understand and we know how to apply

793
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,840
cyber security is a shared

794
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,080
responsibility it is not just for

795
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,880
nerds not just for ict professionals not

796
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,200
just for instant responders it's the

797
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,600
responsibility for the whole community

798
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,840
for the global you know

799
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,200
society

800
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,799
everybody has a role

801
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,399
no one

802
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,399
can claim that cyber security does not

803
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,720
affect them it's around us and moving

804
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,520
forward you know with billions of

805
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,159
devices that are linked to the internet

806
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,440
and a lot of attack vectors uh that are

807
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,760
being created you know criminals they

808
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,600
are full-time as it was mentioned

809
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,919
earlier in a couple of the keynote

810
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,399
speeches i mean in the conference

811
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,840
they are full-time professional

812
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,840
criminals so they they have the

813
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,880
motivations they have the resources

814
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,039
and i'll tell you they have easy

815
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,279
straightforward ways of agreeing you

816
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,559
know how to do their criminal activities

817
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,799
we cannot really underestimate this and

818
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,799
we cannot let you know

819
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,200
some superficial differences on where

820
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,679
we're coming from being barriers for us

821
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,600
to reach a more effective way of

822
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,360
cooperation and partnership because

823
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,760
again partnership is not a nice to have

824
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,720
thing it's our only hope really to have

825
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,919
effective

826
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,200
you know uh

827
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,120
ways of facing the challenges and the

828
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,840
threats so it's a shared responsibility

829
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,240
everybody has a stake everybody has an

830
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,960
interest and when i say i've never been

831
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,360
in a conference or given a talk

832
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,200
throughout my professional life where

833
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,840
cyber security was seen as not important

834
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,880
it is when you ask people to reach out

835
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,480
and make decisions

836
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,240
you think cyber security is important

837
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,840
can you reach out to your wallet i need

838
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,840
a budget for cyber security

839
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,600
that's the challenge

840
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,080
and sometimes i get a response what's

841
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,840
the return on investment

842
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,880
well if i lose an asset if it is

843
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,159
hardware

844
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,480
yeah the cost of that hardware is you

845
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,679
know the threat

846
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,799
you know

847
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,880
you know consequence

848
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,039
but if i lose trust

849
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,240
how much money we put on that if we lose

850
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,240
the ability of our healthcare system to

851
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,519
function

852
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,080
and somebody loses their life

853
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,399
uh do you put a value on this

854
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,919
at a i mean at a general high level you

855
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,080
know uh country

856
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,880
level uh or continent level i come also

857
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,880
from africa so

858
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,240
during profit time without icts many of

859
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,240
our societies would not function would

860
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,039
not learn education would stop would not

861
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,480
be able to work

862
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,200
do

863
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,519
transact financially

864
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,240
i mean i mean provide health care so i

865
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,640
think now we are at a unique position

866
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,519
where when the general public appreciate

867
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,039
the value added of icts appreciate also

868
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,640
the challenges

869
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,240
that we face we are in together and we

870
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,640
should look for solutions that really

871
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,679
accommodate where we are coming from and

872
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,200
you know what the community is looking

873
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,159
for us

874
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,480
as an instance response community when

875
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,279
it comes to supporting the international

876
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,200
you know safety and security and more

877
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,919
importantly for us to play the role that

878
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,720
we are expected to do when it comes to

879
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,640
providing the technical and professional

880
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,880
expertise and you know in making this

881
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,640
happen

882
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,799
uh our views were communicated to the

883
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,880
open-ended working group you can look

884
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,519
through the slides openness inclusive

885
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,840
approaches a multi-step older approach

886
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,159
was was highlighted

887
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,840
also we quoted from the un gge reports

888
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,799
about not using t-search for offensive

889
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,480
uh you know operations also not to

890
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,080
politicize c-certs

891
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,399
this is really important again we don't

892
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,240
have time for it thank you very much

893
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,799
here is you know my contact information

894
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,360
uh so i guess we have a few minutes for

895
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,279
question and answers and i'm really

896
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,360
happy to address this i think this is

897
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,519
you know something that is going on to

898
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,440
not go away in the coming you know

899
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,960
uh decades

900
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,720
discussions about cyber securities and

901
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,960
norms so i i really

902
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,720
i hope that i convey the message that we

903
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,640
need to engage we need to support we

904
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,480
have a role to play and i wish you the

905
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,480
best

906
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,720
thank you very much sharif does anyone

907
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,760
anyone have any questions

908
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,640
hi thank you for your presentation i

909
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,320
wanted to touch a little bit upon the

910
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,239
issue of attribution

911
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,719
i'm part of an organization i work for

912
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,960
an organization that is part of the eu

913
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
public administration

914
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,639
and in the eu we primarily deal with

915
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,079
attribution as a diplomatic issue and in

916
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,079
the european union we even have

917
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,239
the cyber security uh the cyber

918
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,520
diplomacy toolbox which once activated

919
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,679
all the relevant decision makers will

920
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,599
come together they will decide on the

921
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,280
basis of the evidence and they will

922
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,359
collectively agree

923
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,199
on the issue of attribution

924
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,839
from a legal uh

925
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,320
viewpoint this is kind of absurd because

926
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,800
if the evidence is there albeit

927
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,159
difficult to to find to to to come by

928
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,000
but if the evidence is there and the

929
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,599
evidence suggests

930
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,918
that somebody has done something

931
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,240
uh that individual or organization or

932
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,240
state is responsible so there's no

933
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,359
question about that we don't need to

934
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,480
collectively

935
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,920
agree on it and then there is us who are

936
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,240
in possession of the evidence we are the

937
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,480
computer emergency response team we

938
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,720
provide this evidence and on the basis

939
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,079
of this evidence

940
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,720
they need to uh make up their minds so

941
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,280
they kind of put us in a difficult

942
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,160
like

943
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,640
almost an impossible situation

944
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,599
in a way i would say that

945
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,920
it's it's it heavily depends on what we

946
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,480
will provide as evidence for them to

947
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,280
make such a decision so my question is

948
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,040
how can we

949
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,079
reach an understanding of who does what

950
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,119
and

951
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,599
how to take to take care of this

952
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,440
issue in a way

953
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,960
very important question thank you for

954
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,200
asking this it's it's really important

955
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,400
you know

956
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,960
at the ungge meetings that i attended 10

957
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,400
years ago

958
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,160
i had discussions with several countries

959
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,480
including very advanced countries and

960
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,760
and um about attribution as i mean

961
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,280
discussing with them

962
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,520
typically what would be the

963
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,760
correct attribution percentage that you

964
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,359
had in the past

965
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,359
the highest was can you guess a number

966
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,400
15

967
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,480
no it was higher than this it was about

968
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,720
60 you're talking to diplomats at this

969
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,200
point so so not talking to you know

970
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,640
certs

971
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,200
but i told them if it is 60 in the most

972
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,640
advanced countries

973
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,160
how about the developing countries we

974
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,079
have 190 something countries in the

975
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,400
world so attribution is quite you know

976
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,160
challenging i'm glad that the eu is

977
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,079
taking this collectively among the eu

978
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,640
community but you have a very

979
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,720
right i mean concern about you know how

980
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,880
much information do you do you share

981
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,480
because you get this in confidence and

982
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,880
so forth this is you know again it's

983
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,640
very hard to answer this in a couple of

984
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,640
minutes but this is quite challenging i

985
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,400
have my experience from my home country

986
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,920
i have my experience working with

987
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,079
international organizations it is very

988
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,280
much region

989
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,839
dependent you know about the legal

990
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,920
structure that governs you know the c

991
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,480
certs i tried as much as possible to

992
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,720
distance the search from becoming an

993
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,400
extension to law enforcement with all

994
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,240
due respect i have a lot of friends from

995
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,440
law enforcement we cooperate on i mean

996
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,599
investigations and stuff like that if it

997
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,839
is at the national level as per you know

998
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,480
the agreed upon framework but i'm not

999
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,560
part of their day-to-day operation

1000
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,119
i shouldn't we should distance ourselves

1001
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,960
from you know being engaged in you know

1002
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,280
political you know type of debates and

1003
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,599
stuff like that we are not diplomats i

1004
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,400
understand how diplomacy work i actually

1005
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,400
participated in you know cyber diplomacy

1006
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,119
workshops but i need to know my borders

1007
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,920
you know so i i i again i don't have an

1008
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,160
easy answer for you but it's a process

1009
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,320
that you need to start based on you know

1010
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,240
what's available to you in terms of the

1011
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,920
legal coverage the legal regulations

1012
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,640
within the eu but to make sure that you

1013
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,720
highlight you have a role to play and if

1014
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,200
you become part of law enforcement you

1015
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,960
will not be able to play your major role

1016
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,839
the main activity

1017
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,560
thank you again for asking we've got uh

1018
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,920
just a little over a minute left do we

1019
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,880
have one more question

1020
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,560
no

1021
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,720
well if not uh

1022
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,240
oh oh one coming excellent

1023
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,160
thank you that was extremely interesting

1024
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,320
i'm in the process of setting up a

1025
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
national c-cert for a very small

1026
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,119
jurisdiction um i'd like to just touch

1027
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,440
on your last point in your presentation

1028
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,560
about ensuring independence and avoiding

1029
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,200
the sort of political

1030
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,800
politicization do you have any

1031
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,960
observations from your work about how

1032
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,880
that can best be achieved or what the

1033
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,520
threats to that might be

1034
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,800
you know you know

1035
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,560
when i mentioned this text come from a

1036
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,520
ungg report that was endorsed by the un

1037
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,400
general assembly so so any member if you

1038
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,920
belong to a state that is a member of

1039
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,920
the eon

1040
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,079
they already signed on this

1041
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,960
how to make it work you know they i mean

1042
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,359
you can refer back to this and whenever

1043
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,599
it comes you know that there are

1044
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,520
different discussions ongoing now that

1045
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,520
are actually tlp red

1046
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,760
but but to tell you the truth

1047
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,560
we if we position ourselves as being uh

1048
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,440
you know

1049
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,839
as much as possible distant from the

1050
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,680
political decisions within you know a

1051
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,320
country or a region that allows us to be

1052
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
more effective and efficient in doing

1053
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,520
our role

1054
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,119
there is no one formula again i'm happy

1055
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,880
to discuss this with you after the

1056
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,000
session

1057
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,359
but it's quite challenging and it's

1058
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,960
quite important that's why it ended up

1059
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,599
in the ungg report they wanted to all

1060
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,640
the world to know about this

1061
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,640
okay i guess all right that

1062
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,079
pretty much wraps up our time i'd like

1063
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,160
to thank sharif again if you give a

1064
