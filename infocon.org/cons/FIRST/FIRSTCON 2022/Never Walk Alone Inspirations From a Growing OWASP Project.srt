6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,720
integration laboratories and i'm say i'm

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,519
going to share the session

8
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,720

17
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,960
saying i'm i don't know why

18

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,159
glowing wasp project and the speaker is

36
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,479
christian fellini thank you thank you

37
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,280
thank you for an intro rio

38
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,119
so my name is christian ferlini i'm a

39
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,399
swiss historian and security engineer

40
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,159
and we're going to talk about

41
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,280
my or our open source web application

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,878
firewall project

43
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,560
called os crs or the os

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,319
mod security

45
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,280
coral set we're a rules project about

46
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,239
regular expressions to detect malicious

47
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,200
hdb traffic if you came here for the

48
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,200
regular expressions then i have to

49
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,840
disappoint you a bit because this is a

50
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,640
bit different

51
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,239
this is a talk

52
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,120
about

53
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,920
this xkcd cartoon you've probably seen

54
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,080
it before it is about the infrastructure

55
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,879
on the internet that ultimately

56
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,920
rests

57
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,319
on a single person maintaining a crucial

58
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,360
library

59
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,080
somewhere maybe in nebraska and when i

60
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,920
joined this project

61
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,680
together with some friends we want to

62
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,879
make sure from day one we're not

63
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,640
the lone nut

64
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,360
in nebraska maintaining this for the

65
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
rest of the internet

66
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,840
and what i'm going to talk to you about

67
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,120
is the history of our projects and how

68
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,519
we came along and the decisions we've

69
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,599
made so if you're an open source

70
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,840
maintainer it can be an inspiration for

71
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,200
you

72
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,879
what you could do

73
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,800
to

74
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,360
have a similar nicely working project a

75
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,680
growing a flourishing project

76
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,480
meet people to join you and if your user

77
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,879
opens or soft and integrated perhaps it

78
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,519
can help you to share our perspective to

79
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,760
see the struggles we're having the pain

80
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,319
we're undergoing to maintain

81
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,720
upstream for you

82
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,159
good

83
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,040
so

84
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,280
what is this this as i said is a web

85
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,200
application security project it's 15

86
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,680
years old there was a israeli company

87
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,080
breach that acquired the engine mod

88
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,080
security and open source software and

89
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,439
they quickly realized they could not

90
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,599
expect their customers to write these

91
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,120
regular expressions themselves it was

92
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,840
much too complicated so there was a real

93
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,000
business need to develop a set of rules

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,400
core rules so to say they could ship

95
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,280
together with their open source engine

96
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,360
that was the birth of our project 15

97
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,519
years ago and it was made open source

98
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,880
from the beginning but it had a

99
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,720
corporate roof

100
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
over it two or three years afterwards

101
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,199
the israeli company was acquired by the

102
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,000
much larger american company and the guy

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,600
running the show back in the day ryan

104
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,560
burnett

105
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,120
decided this was the perfect moment to

106
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,440
take the open source rule set and move

107
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,000
it out from the corporate roof

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,520
under the roof of the ovus foundation

109
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,400
always like first is an american

110
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,199
foundation and always has over two or

111
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,280
three hundred chapters around the globe

112
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280
and dozens of dozens of projects you

113
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,080
probably know always from the os top ten

114
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,479
there is over sap and os crs is another

115
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,919
flagship project so legally we became

116
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,039
independent however in reality it was

117
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,919
still mostly a one-man show driven by

118
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,960
that american company

119
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,560
maintaining it

120
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,639
so he was still working there

121
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,759
even though it was formally independent

122
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,240
the project died down in the following

123
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,560
years and 2015

124
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,280
ryan burnett quit and his successor

125
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,720
asked me

126
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,479
and a friend to revive the project

127
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,680
but before we get there

128
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,840
i need to be closer to the clicker yeah

129
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,160
so before we got there ryan burnett also

130
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,120
started an experiment he had an idea of

131
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,759
an experimental feature that is called

132
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,919
animally scoring that is not quite

133
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,080
obvious when a web application file

134
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,840
usually detects something you would

135
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,400
block immediately but what he would do

136
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,039
with separating the sensor from the

137
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,759
blocking decision this may a sound very

138
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,199
obvious and b

139
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,520
what does it really give you it gives

140
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,840
you a lot of flexibility namely doing

141
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,360
the integration

142
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,240
so without going too much into technic

143
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,759
technicalities

144
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,639
it is here to explain you he had this

145
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,720
idea and he was not

146
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,800
seen clearly but this was going it was

147
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,199
an experiment but it proved promising

148
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,680
and over the years we grew with

149
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,639
experience around this and when we took

150
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,120
over the project years later we made

151
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,840
this an essential features because we by

152
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,000
then we had understood how important

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,199
this was very often that is not clear

154
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,600
from beginning so this takes time to

155
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,120
develop

156
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,080
good so eventually he moved away the

157
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,360
project died down his successor asked me

158
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,280
and a friend from the netherlands back

159
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,520
into the project you guys want to revive

160
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,199
this and say yeah that that would be

161
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,840
interesting it's a promising project it

162
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,919
has a lot of potential unfortunately it

163
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,639
died down but let's give this a shot

164
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,479
and we immediately developed the vision

165
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,360
if we start over from scratch or revive

166
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
is bring this back to life we need to

167
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
have a common goal the three of us need

168
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,520
to have a goal but we want to go

169
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,880
and we defined usability documentation

170
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,199
and the power of the rule set as the

171
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,680
core essential we want to provide or

172
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,240
improve usability like every so much

173
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,479
software the use case is good but the

174
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,919
ride for the user is very rocky and you

175
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,840
back in the day you could

176
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,560
install mod security crs on top and your

177
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,000
web application would immediately stop

178
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,520
working everything was blocked

179
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,639
everything was on deny you would have to

180
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,520
work a lot until it was running again

181
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,919
and that ruined the whole customer

182
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,080
experience of course so we wanted to

183
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,919
improve that and we achieved this

184
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,560
relatively quickly with a much better

185
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,039
usability but it's still our

186
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,240
number one priority to tune away false

187
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,199
positive full false positive is that

188
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,960
what makes the experience of a web

189
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,479
application fall

190
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,720
web application fireball

191
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,440
very bad very often of course

192
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
documentation was lacking so we had to

193
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,919
improve that we're still improving

194
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,919
documentation as we move along and then

195
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,680
we wanted to make a powerful rule set of

196
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,160
course well everybody would expect a web

197
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,639
application fireball to be powerful and

198
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,879
detect all the malicious traffic out

199
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,039
there but actually that's not how the

200
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,360
incentives really work namely in the

201
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,039
commercial market

202
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,599
so we defined this as a core goal and

203
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,360
we're still hunting after this of course

204
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,440
it's always a rat race with the

205
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,760
attackers improving the rule set

206
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,519
improving as we move forward

207
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,479
good disentanglement uh

208
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,440
when we revived the project the guy came

209
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,000
sanders from the corp american company

210
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,240
he quit his job as well and instead of

211
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,399
handing over the os project to his

212
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,440
successor at his job he took it with him

213
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,240
so he moved away and he took the project

214
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,839
because legally it was an always

215
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,680
foundation project and of course the

216
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,839
american company they still treated this

217
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,680
as their own as if they owned it and

218
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,440
they had to be explained no no you're no

219
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
longer owning it actually it has been

220
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,000
given to over six eight years ago and

221
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,160
now we're running on our own website we

222
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,560
run our own project we welcome on our

223
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,800
own developers and you probably have to

224
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,240
live with that and they hated it of

225
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,040
course

226
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,360
that was not in the minds but we thought

227
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,640
it was time to walk in our own shoes to

228
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,640
do our own thing now and but that moment

229
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,200
that freedom really allowed us to bring

230
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,320
in new people into our project i'm not

231
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,080
saying that every open source project

232
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,160
has to be free of corporate interest not

233
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,560
at all but if you want to attract

234
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,200
third-party developers and that american

235
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,800
company definitely did not provide

236
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,360
enough developer power for us

237
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,920
you need to be at a certain distance

238
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,440
from commercial interest or people will

239
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,760
volunteer to work

240
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,480
for

241
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,560
a commercial company for free and that's

242
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,560
not cutting it nobody's interested to

243
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,160
really do this so we became an

244
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,079
alternative for people for security

245
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,480
engineers to their day job in their day

246
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,800
job they had business need there was

247
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,200
schedule there was road map and all

248
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,600
stuff and people talking to them and in

249
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,519
their spare time they could use their

250
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,320
own skills the same skill to work as a

251
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,040
volunteers on a very welcoming project

252
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,959
but they were allowed to experiment to

253
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,640
do the things they wanted to do at their

254
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,279
day job but couldn't so we became

255
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,680
attractive as an alternative for the

256
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,839
very same

257
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,760
people good

258
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,240
next one we made a first release we did

259
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,880
release notes we did a blog post we

260
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,959
explained everything on the mailing list

261
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,200
but then we also invested

262
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,519
quite a bit of time actually into this

263
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,760
release poster so we had a professional

264
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,000
graphical designer designed this as a

265
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,800
movie poster with the hope to make it

266
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,600
known a bit to go a bit viral to put it

267
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,519
up on slashdot back in the day slashdot

268
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,600
was a thing and we actually hit slashdot

269
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,519
with that and it was a lot of fun and a

270
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,600
lot of our user is still having this

271
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,839
poster in their office

272
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,800
so that's cool and from the beginning

273
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,200
this to say we try to make this fun add

274
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,279
a bit of twist make it attractive make a

275
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,800
stand out of it

276
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,680
from the competition

277
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,839
next one

278
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,720
this is a market scene from kiev in

279
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,880
ukraine i don't know if the market still

280
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,040
exists i certainly hope so

281
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,720
i have to photo here because of the

282
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,399
apple and oranges

283
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,880
there are a lot of very similar looking

284
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,880
apple and oranges here

285
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,839
in this market this could be github

286
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,480
this could be a market like github where

287
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,240
a lot a lot of projects very interesting

288
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,880
nice good-looking projects are

289
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,519
struggling for developers as you will

290
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,600
see there are relative few customers

291
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,399
here

292
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,480
it's a developer market there is a

293
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,399
scarcity of developers volunteering to

294
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,160
spend their time

295
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,480
developing regular expressions you find

296
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,040
a relatively few people willing to do

297
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,399
this in their spare time because it's

298
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,120
very boring so it is a struggle to get

299
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,519
these smart people to volunteer for your

300
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,839
project it's definitely a competition

301
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,680
and the developers have choice if they

302
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,240
have spare time to to volunteer to give

303
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,160
to a project there are many many

304
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,800
projects interested in them so it is a

305
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,600
real competition and the developers are

306
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,240
our most valuable assets that we have

307
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,519
diversity

308
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,600
from the beginning once we took over the

309
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,839
project we did the first release we did

310
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,920
the movie poster we attracted more

311
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,240
developers we've started to grow we're

312
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,040
up to 12 14 active developers now

313
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,760
comparison to a single man show on the

314
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,200
corporate roof

315
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,160
we have very diverse backgrounds we have

316
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,600
a female cso in our in our project we

317
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,839
have two guys running an isp

318
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,639
we have a cto from a larger isp we have

319
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,399
several security engineers we have

320
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,959
people working the public sector using

321
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,279
our stuff and i'm a consultant and

322
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,920
teacher on web application firewall and

323
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,320
whenever we have a new problem if a

324
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,040
bypass hits us a security researcher

325
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,760
shares information with us we have very

326
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,519
diverse approach to that different

327
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,519
perspectives and this adds to our

328
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,600
resilience because our team is so

329
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,240
diverse we come up with different

330
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,399
potential solutions very often

331
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,959
complementary solution so this is really

332
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,839
good

333
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,720
in contrast to the corporate setup where

334
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,120
people are recruited by hr and they're

335
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,800
much more alike

336
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,240
in a typical corporate team we're open

337
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,560
and it's possible for us to be much more

338
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,360
diverse admittedly we're too much

339
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,480
european too much western we have a

340
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,240
problem with unicode and utf-8

341
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,399
internationalization our engine is

342
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,720
limited in this regard and on top we are

343
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,800
limited in this regard and our knowledge

344
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,120
about this our experience with that is

345
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,519
limited in this regard meaning we're

346
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,560
letting

347
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,920
asian users down to quite a far extent

348
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,040
having

349
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,120
asian people join a project would be

350
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,360
beneficial so this is a weak spot for us

351
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,839
despite the diversity that we actually

352
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:16,720
have

353
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,480
knowledge we have an experience of over

354
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,519
a hundred years of operation with mod

355
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,600
security production very few

356
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,760
organizations in the world have over a

357
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,120
hundred years of experience running a

358
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,560
baffin production

359
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,639
so we bring together a unique experience

360
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,079
and unique backpack of pain running this

361
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,399
in production because mod security can

362
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,720
be extremely painful but it can also be

363
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,120
very satisfactory when you know you've

364
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,519
set this up in a clean way customers are

365
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,279
no longer affected by false positive and

366
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,880
you get a good night of sleep because

367
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,680
you know you have a decent first line of

368
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,720
defense

369
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,839
in place

370
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:56,959
by now

371
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,440
all the big cdns all the cloud providers

372
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,920
have a crs offering so they have all

373
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,079
integrated our stuff and we're kind of

374
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,600
the dominant player in the market we're

375
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,680
the only open source offering and the

376
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,240
commercial ones in user base are much

377
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,279
smaller than whatobut crs

378
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,560
is so we are kind of the go-to place for

379
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,119
the open source buff in the world

380
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,680
you have to formalize when you do a

381
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,399
security project any project perhaps

382
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,120
to a certain extent

383
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,560
you want to make sure you're not

384
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,639
forgetting something you need to have

385
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,120
certain procedures in case namely in

386
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,720
times of a release i mean a release

387
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,880
procedure you have to think about all

388
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,959
the steps that you need to do and sign

389
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,079
the release binary in the end but then

390
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,120
all this formalization these processes

391
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,240
is also killing innovation bureaucracy

392
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,480
is the enemy of innovation and

393
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,720
innovation is what developers attracts

394
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,680
to our project so the more we formalize

395
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,000
the more we take the breath away from

396
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,079
the developers so we have to strike a

397
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,240
balance in here we have to maintain

398
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,360
decent procedures without boring people

399
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,120
and this is relatively difficult to do

400
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
in a corporate setting you say look

401
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,720
you're paid to do this work and i'll do

402
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,680
this

403
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,279
we go

404
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,199
you volunteer to do this work here now

405
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,639
do it and then people won't rough

406
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,720
because that's not what they want to do

407
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,839
so we try to formalize but only just as

408
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,480
much as little as necessary to get the

409
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,600
stuff the job done we try to organize

410
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,320
this as a roundtable of people on eye

411
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,160
level talking about technical

412
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,839
discussions a lot of technical

413
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,399
discussions obviously and that allows

414
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,639
for innovation people bringing in your

415
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,600
ideas we handle a lot we are chat we

416
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,759
have an agenda when we meet in chat but

417
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,000
outside of that agenda is like dots that

418
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,079
we're covering it's completely free and

419
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,000
people bring in their ideas and by the

420
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,800
way i want to try this out be my guest

421
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,279
this is a green field develop anything

422
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,600
you want and show it to us and then we

423
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,400
discuss it but we make it into mainline

424
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,799
or not

425
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,599
we have a luxury of perfection

426
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,599
if you're in a corporate setting and you

427
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,480
tell your boss look we've developed this

428
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,720
twice already and then we refactor it

429
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,520
twice but i honestly think we need to

430
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,160
return to the same piece of code and we

431
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,760
need to write it from scratch again at a

432
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,439
given moment your boss will say hey hold

433
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,319
on

434
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,039
this is good enough this is at least a

435
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,880
minimal viable product let's ship it and

436
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,360
be done with it this is not how we can

437
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,240
operate we have the luxury of

438
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,360
polishing something as much as we want

439
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,200
if somebody from our develops

440
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,520
tells us and say hey look we need to

441
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,600
redo this because it's still not the way

442
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
it should be this is not beautiful

443
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,520
enough this is not really a static it's

444
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,960
still a bit of a hack i don't like they

445
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,200
have a bad feeling about this then yes

446
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,880
let's let's do this

447
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,120
we can allow our develops to do this

448
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,160
because we don't really have

449
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,640
business constraints we want to ship we

450
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,480
want to do releases we want to do

451
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,559
releases and times there are additional

452
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,720
incentives actually so too many releases

453
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,200
are not good for our customers

454
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,640
but we

455
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,960
compared to a commercial outfit we have

456
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,240
a lot of luxury that we can work on the

457
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,960
same code base again and again and it

458
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,280
comes down to a lot to aesthetics to

459
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,760
have a clean code base because a clean

460
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,919
and beautiful copays is inviting for

461
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,000
people to review it if people are able

462
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,080
to review it we get security researchers

463
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,080
to look at our rules if security

464
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,760
researchers are able to look at our

465
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,840
rules they will report their findings

466
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,559
and we can then improve so this is all a

467
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,200
very positive cycle the refactoring and

468
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,160
the polishing helps us to improve and of

469
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,480
course finding vulnerabilities as we

470
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,280
move along

471
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,200
clicker is a bit yeah we have leadership

472
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,440
so we are the three of us running this

473
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,039
project with 12 14 people

474
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,240
talking to

475
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,559
all the cloud providers by now i made to

476
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,200
contact the aws today so far and never

477
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,880
succeeded but here at the conference

478
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,240
this works so we're talking to azure aws

479
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,840
cloudflare akamai verizon media now

480
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,039
edgecast

481
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,600
and so on and we're trying to run this

482
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,240
project it's all a hobby project how can

483
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,799
we run this project one thing

484
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,640
that i had to realize

485
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,880
i wrote the mod security handbook i

486
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,400
thought i had a certain idea how this

487
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,960
works but the longer this goes the more

488
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,360
i feel i'm the newbie here in the house

489
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,720
because the new developers were

490
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,880
attracting they're so smart and

491
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,760
brilliant in their domain that i i move

492
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,960
back and go hey you guys are so good i'm

493
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,880
just a moderator here and i think it's a

494
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,320
natural role

495
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,280
in a

496
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,320
open source development because as the

497
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,120
leader you cannot be a perfectionist

498
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,720
the moment

499
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,280
you try to be a perfectionist in open

500
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
source project

501
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,440
and you drive your volunteers to

502
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,039
perfectionism

503
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,640
you drive them away

504
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,320
because if they are not interested in

505
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,159
the quality level you expect from them

506
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,559
you end up doing everything yourself you

507
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,799
you you try to drive them there and then

508
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,640
eventually they throw up and they walk

509
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,000
out the door and you have to do it

510
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,679
everything yourself and you end up in

511
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,840
nebraska we don't want to go there it

512
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,679
has to be the other way around

513
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,480
we need to be the liberal moderators

514
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,559
inviting the developers

515
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,960
to be perfectionists themselves they

516
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,080
tell us when a pull request is ready and

517
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,159
polished enough now to merge they

518
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,240
amongst themselves they review each

519
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,039
other and drive to perfection and we can

520
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,679
try kind of be a liberal if you guys

521
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,440
tell me this is good enough then we're

522
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,919
fine with it this is good this allows

523
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,000
for an atmosphere where a newbie comes

524
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,720
in and knows if i'm talking to to the

525
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,840
big

526
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,679
leader in this project these are nice

527
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,360
people they were liberal they were open

528
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,880
they tried to help me

529
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,200
they tried to somebody to coach me to

530
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,480
get my pull request to perfection

531
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,720
so this is working

532
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,559
if we are liberal leaders

533
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,360
swag many open source projects have

534
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,760
their web shop somewhere they try to

535
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,600
sell hoodies and t-shirts and stickers

536
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,880
that's not working

537
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,120
honestly it works for very few projects

538
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,520
swag is cheap it's distracting your

539
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,280
developers somebody has to do the web

540
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,400
shop somebody has to maintain it

541
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,799
somebody's come up with photos whatever

542
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,480
we gave up on that completely if

543
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,760
somebody wants to do logo uh t-shirts we

544
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,919
have all the logos on github print your

545
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,240
own t-shirts sell them if you want we

546
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,320
don't care it's distracting it's ireland

547
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,080
for the project what is much more

548
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,039
interesting is sponsorship sponsorship

549
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,600
is interesting because it's plannable

550
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,440
you can't have a good day and it's some

551
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,200
serious money namely if you're in

552
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,120
position to talk to big vendors the big

553
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,320
integrators they make money for stuff so

554
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,400
they kind of want to know to talk to us

555
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,000
you just need to find the right people

556
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,159
it's a sales process but once you have

557
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,760
found the right people they're

558
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,679
interested in the conversation because

559
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,480
very often the the big integrators

560
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,159
they're not running the stuff themselves

561
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,080
they're selling it they don't have a

562
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,080
hundred years of experience running our

563
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,799
stuff if they have serious questions

564
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,960
they want to talk to us so we're

565
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,240
entering in a very positive partnership

566
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,000
situation and we're interested in their

567
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,600
experience of course we're interested in

568
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,080
their feedback what we should do because

569
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,720
we again are not necessarily talking to

570
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,039
the end users so a sponsorship

571
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,360
relationship can be very beneficial

572
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,120
apparently need to have the parameters

573
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,000
right

574
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,240
but in our situation this works really

575
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,039
nicely we took this into our hand a year

576
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,520
or two ago and now we attracted a

577
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,760
hundred thousand dollars in sponsorship

578
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,760
money annually and you can get things

579
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,000
done with uh the amount of money giving

580
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,760
you one example we're running a

581
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,480
developer and duty program that means if

582
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,799
you hit our project on twitter stack

583
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,360
overflow slack mating list

584
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,600
or github with an issue with a question

585
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,520
an entry level question we have a

586
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
developer who's on duty to respond to

587
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,080
you and we kind of try to do this within

588
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,400
24 hours so we have first level support

589
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,080
in place for free sponsored by a sponsor

590
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,720
and that way we can pay our developers a

591
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,880
bit of money you get 200 for being the

592
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,960
developer duty per week and for some of

593
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,320
our developers that is substantial money

594
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,400
it's actually attractive and it's good

595
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,240
and it's nice for an open source project

596
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,440
to provide

597
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,720
guaranteed support only possible thanks

598
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,880
to sponsors

599
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,559
retention

600
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,480
developers

601
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,159
life continues

602
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,640
they get kids they change their job they

603
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,440
change their focus they wander off

604
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,000
it's the same problem in an enterprise

605
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,559
when you lose a developer an import a

606
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,960
key employee you lose so much knowledge

607
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,360
and experience it walks out the door and

608
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,279
it's very hard to keep them back and

609
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,679
it's even harder for us because

610
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,240
there is very little we can offer them

611
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,120
outside of pain sweat and probably blood

612
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,039
and a lot of time spent on boring and

613
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,559
regular expressions

614
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,200
so we need to make sure that we can

615
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,039
retain them and they feel at ease they

616
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,200
feel good volunteering the time they

617
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,760
feel good donating the time to our

618
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,559
project without getting too much back

619
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,720
one thing that helps us is setting up

620
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,279
personal ties physical meetings get to

621
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,840
know each other spending time outside

622
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,720
get up together to retain them in the

623
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,279
project because again developers are so

624
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,320
valuable

625
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,360
for our project

626
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,080
quality assurance i told you about the

627
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,240
aesthetics of code that we really have

628
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,400
in mind that we want to have

629
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,840
so we want to have reviews we want to be

630
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,640
auditable in a sense people should be

631
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,360
accessible the code base and then we

632
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,360
also remove a lot of stuff

633
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,159
we have a very good position that we our

634
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,400
copa is relatively small it's just a

635
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,840
couple of regular expressions a few

636
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840
hundred of regular expressions and we

637
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,760
try to remove them make it even smaller

638
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,559
so it's easier to review of course but

639
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,200
it's also reducing the attack surface

640
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,400
overall

641
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,360
and this allows researchers again to

642
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,760
review our code so this

643
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,400
all comes together in helping us

644
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,640
maintain or raise the level of quality

645
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,960
of our software that we deliver i think

646
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,120
that's really important and it came out

647
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,679
in recent years that we need procedures

648
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,520
how to do this without making it feel

649
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,039
like a procedure of course

650
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,440
fun so

651
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,760
we tried to meet outside github we did a

652
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,159
one week developer retreat in the swiss

653
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,720
alps last year where we would meet with

654
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,000
11 people for a whole week developing

655
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,320
something together work on the project

656
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,559
together and have a few adventures go

657
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,960
hiking and stuff like that to build up

658
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,000
these personal thai friendships have

659
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,720
something doing together we run a signal

660
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,159
channel and the only thing we do on

661
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,919
signal is making jokes about pineapple

662
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,919
pizza i think

663
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,799
and this is extreme it's only for fun

664
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,840
purposes but it creates cohesion within

665
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,360
the project there's all these sorts of

666
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,360
insider jokes that makes sets up an

667
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,600
insider group and it's so much fun

668
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,200
people to be part of it so we're outside

669
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,919
the daily constraints in your commercial

670
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,559
company we're a safe space where you can

671
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,279
meet your friends without a boss looking

672
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,440
over your shoulders and you can do funny

673
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,120
or idiotic things as much as you want

674
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,840
and nobody cares as long as it's fun for

675
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,919
everybody

676
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,600
trans

677
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,360
transparency

678
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,960
we're an open source project

679
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,520
transparency in our dna and we want to

680
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,279
be as open as accessible as possible

681
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,159
i've come to see the last few years

682
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:00,960
uh

683
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,400
one or two years actually there is

684
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,640
always a drive to be no longer

685
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,440
transparent to take discussions behind

686
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,640
the curtain

687
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,480
and it's all it's important to always

688
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,799
know let's push this out this should be

689
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,760
in public just keep the really really

690
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,679
secret confidential things the dirty

691
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,760
laundry don't wash in public for example

692
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,200
keep that behind the curtain but the

693
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,080
rest our chat archives are published

694
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,840
everybody should be able to understand

695
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,159
why we're doing something at times it's

696
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,760
hard to understand but if you have the

697
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,919
archive how we discussed about it that's

698
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,799
actually useful so we want to be as open

699
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,320
and accessible

700
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,440
and inviting for newcomers as possible

701
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,080
because again we want to attract people

702
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,919
to donate their time

703
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,799
to our project

704
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,399
we try

705
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,799
to do a lot of our decisions all of our

706
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,840
decisions if possible we are consensus

707
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,240
we're not driving by hard time against

708
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,360
schedules

709
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,919
so we are all on equal level at least

710
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,080
the technical level we're all equals and

711
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,000
we've discussed things

712
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,080
and we've learned that very often

713
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,880
the timing isn't right for a decision

714
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,679
it's better to let it rest for a couple

715
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,080
of weeks until we take a decision and

716
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,640
then once it sets then people start to

717
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,880
realize understand each other's

718
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,520
arguments and then we're able to settle

719
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,320
a discourse in a very friendly way i

720
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,399
think we have never really forced a hard

721
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,120
decision that could rip the project

722
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,440
apart because if you end up with two

723
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,360
factions in your project

724
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,279
i mean the worst thing would be to have

725
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,760
somebody fork over a tiny technical

726
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,919
detail that would be idiotic it's better

727
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,279
to let it dress and revisit and as us

728
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,440
i've also learned personally the

729
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,159
solution that we finally agreed on was

730
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,039
much better than my initial idea just

731
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,080
because we let it rest for a couple of

732
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,960
weeks a month at times it takes half a

733
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,360
year until we have a solution to

734
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,279
something that we're not quite happy

735
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,520
with but we don't really know how to

736
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,000
improve it so we slowly approach it with

737
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,120
analysis and reports and then talk again

738
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,720
again again until we have a joint view

739
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,360
of this and all this together the course

740
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,760
of 15 years

741
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,679
is coming together in something which i

742
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,279
think is very beautiful it's a

743
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,440
flourishing project it's a blossoming

744
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,919
come on clicker it's a blossoming

745
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,320
project that is for me very beautiful to

746
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,240
work within and i think it looks very

747
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,960
beautiful from outside it's a group of

748
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,679
friends coming together as developers to

749
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,360
do what they really love to do with all

750
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,320
their passion writing very strong

751
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,840
security rules into a beautiful code

752
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,120
base

753
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,080
that they share for free on the internet

754
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,120
and naturally a community outside that

755
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,559
uses our stuff that loves our stuff on

756
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,960
their web applications to secure them

757
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,279
for the better and the better security

758
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,799
of the internet thank you very much

759
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,840
i think we have exactly five minutes for

760
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,360
question that was perfect timing wasn't

761
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,439
it

762
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,840
so questions

763
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,440
did i stun you

764
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,039
if there's uh

765
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,799
no questions i i have one yes please so

766
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,760
i had a difficulty of uh

767
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,480
and you mentioned that sponsorship is

768
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,000
important but uh kind of a pricing uh

769
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,080
their contribution

770
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,880
might be a little bit difficult uh

771
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,679
how

772
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,000
i mean how do you so they do they do it

773
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,600
on their own motivation usually but uh

774
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,240
you provide some uh kind of

775
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,679
uh money to them uh so uh how how do you

776
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,360
kind of balance them

777
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,080
with developers or with the sponsors

778
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,519
uh

779
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,360
with developers so

780
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,080
some get paid some no they're usually

781
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,159
not paid okay but that's a very good

782
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,559
question so we're a volunteer driven

783
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,919
project

784
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,000
and we want to be a volunteer driven

785
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
project and then suddenly money comes

786
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,919
into the game and once money is on the

787
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,919
table it gets really risky i think this

788
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,000
is really dangerous for the project to

789
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
accept money

790
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,399
and you want to share the money within

791
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,559
the project but you don't want to get

792
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,799
into a situation where people envy each

793
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,120
other over the money they're getting so

794
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,600
so far the policy has been we're

795
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,880
financing fringe activities around

796
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,640
support questions

797
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,279
on twitter in their spare time yeah we

798
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,480
finance that we do you coach a google

799
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,640
summer of code student

800
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,960
in your spare time next year project we

801
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,640
pay you for the coaching more than

802
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,240
google is paying you we do uh

803
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,240
we do an animal developer retreat in

804
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,159
switzerland we pay the trip we pay the

805
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,840
hotel we pay the food we pay all the

806
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,799
activities of course but you provide a

807
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,840
better regular expression in a rule set

808
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,519
you do this for free

809
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,440
and so far that has been the rule

810
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,600
however with the success of our

811
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,840
sponsorship project now

812
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,559
and the large amount of work that we

813
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,279
need to do we might have to revise this

814
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,440
one approach could be

815
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,880
and this is very new now is to think

816
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,320
about when we have security findings and

817
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,640
we run a bug bounty project this spring

818
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,200
a big integrator spent several hundred

819
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
thousand dollars

820
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,440
paying to security researchers to report

821
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,840
findings to us so the researchers got a

822
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,519
lot of money somebody paid that and we

823
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,279
get to have to work for free

824
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,799
and we're now in a situation that we're

825
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,960
overwhelmed with these bypasses these

826
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,279
are special patterns working around the

827
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,399
rule set

828
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,200
and

829
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,600
it's very unthankful to improve these

830
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,080
regular expressions but we could try to

831
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,640
divide this work a bit and do part of

832
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,760
this work

833
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,279
pay for somebody

834
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,039
that that could be an approach but it

835
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,399
would be

836
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,360
a revision of this rule where we say hey

837
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,600
the the core center of our work is is

838
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,159
still volunteer driven

839
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,960
but this might have to change i'm trying

840
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,559
to talk to all the developers how do you

841
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,720
feel about this look there is a security

842
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,640
researcher and looking at the numbers he

843
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,799
apparently bought a new car from what he

844
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,880
got from this buck bounty how do you

845
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,320
feel about this because for you it's a

846
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,679
spare time you could buy a new house

847
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:44,799
with that money

848
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,080
and most of our developers um

849
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,320
are easier about this than i am i think

850
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,080
hey money on the table makes everything

851
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,080
complicated and to say hey

852
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,000
it's beneficial for a project i still

853
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,320
enjoy the project anyway and it's not my

854
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,720
money so i don't care

855
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,360
so they feel quite at ease but i'm very

856
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,080
sensitive about money in the game it's

857
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,800
just something if we want to grow

858
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,960
and pursue the ideas we have with the

859
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,679
project then money is kind of

860
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,599
necessary we couldn't meet without
