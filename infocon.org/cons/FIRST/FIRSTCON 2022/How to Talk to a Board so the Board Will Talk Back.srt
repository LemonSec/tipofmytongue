back uh my name is philip meisner i'm

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,440
the session chair for this

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,000
group i'd like to introduce to you helen

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,240
patton she's an advisory uh cso at uh

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,720
cisco she has a background

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,960
for more than i think a dozen years in

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,800
security including at the ohio state

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,519
university and at uh

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,039
morgan chase

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,520
bank there so with that i will invite

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,440
her to the stage to talk about talking

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,559
to the board

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,010
thank you

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,800
[Applause]

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,399
hi everyone thank you for coming this

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,879
afternoon i hope the coffee that you

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,399
just got is going to get you through the

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,000
next session we'll see how well we do

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,760
with that i'm going to run through this

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,840
in about half an hour the idea here is

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,600
to give you as much time for questions

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,120
as possible but i want to start with a

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,960
couple of questions for you first of all

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,239
is there anyone in the room who's

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,680
already on a public board

28
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,359
oh thank god because

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,959
they're the people who disagree with me

30
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,400
generally about the things i'm about to

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,240
say is there anyone in the room who's

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,280
presented to a board public or otherwise

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,600
about a security program yeah how'd that

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,680
work out for everyone

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,840
you okay pretty good

36
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,400
yeah it's sort of like the worst exam

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,680
you can ever take

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,720
i think

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,119
um so what i'm gonna cover today

40
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,840
the the problem we have

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,439
talking to the board

42
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,280
roles and responsibilities between the

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,799
board and management at an organization

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,200
okay which i think this is probably the

45
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,720
crux of the problem i'll get into that

46
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,759
in a second how to engage the board

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,840
if you want to engage the board the

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,399
board wants to engage us

49
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,960
but they don't know how so let's tell

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,439
them how to engage us what to say how to

51
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,040
say it and

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,479
what to watch out for there'll be

53
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,000
dragons that's what we're going to cover

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,439
today so hopefully that's what you're

55
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,759
here for if not now is a great time to

56
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,960
stand up and leave and i won't be

57
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,320
offended but this is what we're going to

58
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,320
cover

59
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,000
so a colleague of mine richard

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,920
archdeacon said helen it's not a problem

61
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,360
it's an opportunity

62
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,760
yeah yeah i wear a tinfoil hat it's a

63
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,640
problem it's a problem talking to boards

64
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,400
whether they're public or whether

65
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,760
they're just the board of your

66
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,760
particular organization

67
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,200
it's a problem and the problem is

68
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,760
we don't really talk the same language

69
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,840
that's sort of the core problem

70
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,239
in security we want to talk about things

71
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,319
like systemic risk

72
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,200
and

73
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,879
threat actors

74
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,840
and issues of the day

75
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,760
and that's not what boards want to talk

76
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,720
about

77
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,040
actually we'll talk about that in a

78
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,720
second

79
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,959
so when it comes to boards

80
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,720
here's the main problem

81
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,040
they don't do security i haven't found

82
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,519
an mba program yet

83
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,519
that goes deep into cyber security or

84
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,959
technical risk

85
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,760
i've seen mba programs that talk about

86
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,080
risk in a financial sense

87
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,560
but you can't put and fight me on this

88
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,480
one i don't think you can put

89
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,200
traditional dollars and cents around

90
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,879
security and security threat and

91
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,800
security incidents

92
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,319
and make it

93
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,280
common

94
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,159
with financial metrics around accounting

95
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,680
and finance

96
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,680
but they want you to

97
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,000
and that's a bit of a problem you can't

98
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,040
do it

99
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,200
i've seen new companies that are popping

100
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,879
up that are trying to take

101
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,920
cyber insurance algorithms and make

102
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,440
those into dollars and cents

103
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,519
calculations so you can put a value at

104
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,879
risk score in front of your board

105
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,480
watch out for that

106
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,319
watch that space but watch out for that

107
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,920
the other problem is boards really

108
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,760
aren't structured to pay attention to

109
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,440
this

110
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,840
security is actually

111
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,000
really nuanced

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,040
it's

113
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,439
really hard which is why as a security

114
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,560
community

115
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
we say to one another you can have all

116
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,480
the certifications you want

117
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,319
you can have all the book learning you

118
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,319
can get but if you haven't worked in the

119
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,439
industry you don't know what the hell

120
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,120
you're talking about

121
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,439
we heard this before

122
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,439
well it's the same for the board we can

123
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,360
put all kinds of white papers in front

124
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,000
of them we can send them to all kinds of

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,079
classes but they're never going to be in

126
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,358
your shoes

127
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,600
they're never going to be in my shoes

128
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,000
and as security people we use security

129
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,199
language

130
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,440
we use words

131
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,919
that other people use

132
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,440
but we mean different things with our

133
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,800
words

134
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,440
and we apply the meanings of those words

135
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,040
in different ways in our security

136
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,840
organizations so risk insecurity is not

137
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,639
the same thing as risk in finance but we

138
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,759
still use the same word risk

139
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,199
and everyone thinks they know what we

140
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,080
mean but they don't

141
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,199
and

142
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,840
to really pay attention to security

143
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,759
you've got to constantly pay attention

144
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,199
to security

145
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,600
and you've got to deeply pay attention

146
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,919
to security which is why you're here and

147
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,520
no one in the room is a board member

148
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,520
right

149
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,560
so

150
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,639
the other problem around particularly

151
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,600
public boards is they are not structured

152
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,440
to pay long deep sustained attention

153
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,240
to security

154
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,759
so if you're an incident responder and

155
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,520
you're feeding information to the board

156
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,880
or the person who's going to sit in

157
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,400
front of the board

158
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,919
that's a problem

159
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,080
because you've got to dumb down

160
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,639
and i do mean you've got to dumb down

161
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,120
what you're talking about to a level

162
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
that board members

163
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,240
are going to find valuable

164
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,960
so security leads on the other hand

165
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,320
don't know how boards should work

166
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,840
these don't

167
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,759
they don't care typically until they

168
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,160
have to i didn't care about the board

169
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,680
structure

170
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,600
i didn't care about what boards thought

171
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,440
about how to put information from the

172
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,840
boards until i had to and we don't learn

173
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,840
it as part of our security curriculum

174
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,720
either and on the job people don't think

175
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,960
to tell security people how to work with

176
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,440
the boards whereas if you're the cfo or

177
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,840
the chief marketing officer or the ceo

178
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,680
or the c whatever

179
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,560
there is learning that you do on the job

180
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,479
that helps you talk to boards they don't

181
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,800
give that to csos or cios often so we

182
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,960
don't know either right

183
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,199
and we're not resourced on our team

184
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,160
appropriately to do that

185
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,000
so that's a bit of a problem don't you

186
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,840
think

187
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,560
the problem with this

188
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,319
is that although you will never go to

189
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,479
your board and ask for money if you do

190
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,720
you're doing the wrong thing by the way

191
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,840
you're never going to go to the board

192
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,759
and ask for money but where the board

193
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,520
puts their attention

194
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,800
so does your c-suite

195
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,560
and if the board isn't putting attention

196
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,919
on security

197
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,000
your c-suite won't either and you won't

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,960
get the resources you need

199
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,639
and to reference the report that wendy

200
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,440
neither talked about this morning

201
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,720
if you're going to have a successful

202
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,560
security program you've got to be able

203
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,639
to enable the business

204
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,919
and you've got to be able to ensure

205
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,840
resilience i know this is a buzzword of

206
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,759
the day at the moment but you've got to

207
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,680
ensure resilience

208
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,639
and if you don't have a good

209
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,880
relationship with the board

210
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,400
the data says

211
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,080
you're going to be sort of pushing

212
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,000
spaghetti uphill with a stick

213
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,000
that's a really bad mixed analogy by the

214
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,919
way just seeing if you're awake

215
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,160
so

216
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,240
what's the board responsible for let's

217
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,680
start with that let's set some bass

218
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,160
lines here

219
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,120
so the cadbury report in 92

220
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,199
it's a long time ago

221
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,039
said this i won't read it to you but

222
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,280
they basically said look the board's got

223
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,080
to be

224
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,080
setting the strategic direction of the

225
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,878
organization

226
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,720
they don't care about

227
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,639
the day-to-day metrics of your

228
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,199
vulnerability management program

229
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,479
how many things got blocked at the

230
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,960
firewall they don't care

231
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,000
right

232
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,759
so they've got to make sure that the

233
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,280
organization's going in the right

234
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,599
direction and that the organization is

235
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,400
structured to go in that direction

236
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,680
that's the cadbury report

237
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,039
the world economic forum more recently

238
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,960
came out with some really great papers

239
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,680
around how boards should be structured

240
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,199
to govern

241
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,520
systemic technology risk

242
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,519
cyber security but really systemic

243
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,039
technology risk

244
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,240
and these are some of the things here

245
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,479
you'll see it here too strategic

246
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,159
they've got to understand the economic

247
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,919
drivers

248
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,719
of

249
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,399
security

250
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,640
um by the way helping them understand

251
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,959
the economic drivers about threat actors

252
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,080
would go

253
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,440
a long way

254
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,880
to helping the board understand what

255
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,959
we're about

256
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,800
business needs for sure

257
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,720
ensure the organizational design

258
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,120
supports cyber security how many of you

259
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,680
feel like your organizational design not

260
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,920
just your security team but your entire

261
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,760
organization supports cyber security

262
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,200
is anyone here willing to raise their

263
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,440
hands on that

264
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,920
no one there's really no one in this

265
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,240
room feels like your organization is

266
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,800
designed to support cyber security risk

267
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,120
oh there's one

268
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,480
bingo

269
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,680
really

270
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,279
wow

271
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,360
for securi the security organization's

272
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,600
well organized yeah this question is

273
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
about the whole

274
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,200
organization right

275
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,160
and i is the board enabling systemic

276
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,880
resilience

277
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,000
bit of a problem

278
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,480
in the us the nacd

279
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,920
came out with a similar look

280
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,240
the nacd because this is public sector

281
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,959
boards wants the board to understand the

282
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,920
potential financial risks associated

283
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,399
with cyber security

284
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,640
they want to make sure

285
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
the nacd suggests that the board should

286
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,279
have access to

287
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,160
good

288
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,959
cyber security expertise

289
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,560
i will tell you the board's first

290
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,640
instinct is to hire a consultant to come

291
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,360
in and talk about cyber security

292
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,680
how many consultants do you know that

293
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,920
really understand your organization

294
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,200
really well

295
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,040
and can give the right context in that

296
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,959
conversation

297
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,480
anyone

298
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,160
and apologies for anyone who's here from

299
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,719
a big four

300
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,040
big four who's the who's they're gonna

301
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,399
call

302
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,320
right because we know security is

303
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,839
contextual

304
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,079
right so we can stand there and talk

305
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,120
about

306
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,880
risk management and incident response

307
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,279
vulnerability management programs and

308
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,720
governance risk and compliance and all

309
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,680
those things

310
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,839
and if it's not applied to the way your

311
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,519
organization works

312
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,279
then the board is going to get the wrong

313
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,640
information

314
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,760
and yet

315
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,000
the nacd says there needs to be somebody

316
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,040
on the board who's an expert

317
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,519
in cyber risk

318
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,079
does your board have an expert

319
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,519
in cyber risk or do they have someone

320
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,120
who used to be a cio sometime

321
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,320
can you tell them a little cynical

322
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,079
here's the here's the gist of where

323
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,959
these things are headed

324
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,360
in most organizations you've got an i.t

325
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,519
organization who talks up

326
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,320
all the benefits of technology

327
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,519
and then you've got a security

328
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,279
organization who talks up all the risks

329
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,240
of sight of of technology

330
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,399
and rarely are those conversations

331
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,240
happening in the same room at the same

332
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,160
time

333
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,680
and it's the board's job to make sure

334
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,240
that that is happening both at the board

335
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,120
level

336
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,079
and also at the management level so when

337
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:02,880
your

338
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,800
leadership is thinking about a new

339
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,040
technology

340
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,360
security should be in the room saying

341
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,959
yes and

342
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,560
here are the technology risks that

343
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,360
you've got to think about and mitigate

344
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
or if your organization is having

345
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,680
conversations about a business deal a

346
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,480
new region or country to go into or a

347
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,800
new merger and acquisition with a with a

348
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,040
partner or a competitor

349
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,360
security needs to be in the room saying

350
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,480
yep great technology and

351
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,639
here are the security risks

352
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,399
that you're going to incur when that

353
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,560
happens and here's how you can mitigate

354
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,279
it

355
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,040
and right now that's not happening

356
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,079
okay

357
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:44,800
so

358
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,160
some things to think about there

359
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,240
so what's the csos role in this well

360
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,040
it's this right the cso's job and by

361
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,000
extension everyone who works in security

362
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,880
and the security ecosystem

363
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,320
is to help directors understand

364
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,839
the risks the cyber risks the security

365
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,279
risks of their vision

366
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,440
for the company

367
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,800
how many of you feel like we're doing

368
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,279
that today

369
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,920
two people in the room

370
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,720
yeah

371
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,480
sort of scary isn't it thinking in those

372
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,360
terms

373
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,959
so

374
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,120
if we're going to do that

375
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,160
we

376
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
unfortunately we

377
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,240
have to engage the board

378
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,800
because they don't know how to engage us

379
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,839
so we've got to reach out

380
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,600
some things to think about first what's

381
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,920
the organizational structure of the

382
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,160
board

383
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,920
do they have a dedicated security person

384
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,839
not necessarily someone from within the

385
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,160
organization but someone who really

386
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,519
understands

387
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,480
and has run a security program

388
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,360
do they have someone like that

389
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,360
do they have directors

390
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,600
does the company have directors in the

391
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,440
organization by directors i mean c-suite

392
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,240
who are technical

393
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,680
okay

394
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,760
do they do you regularly report to the

395
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,880
board

396
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,199
i've spoken to some organizations in

397
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,199
public companies that have only got in

398
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,040
front of the full board

399
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,440
once a year

400
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,720
and they're lucky if they get in front

401
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,240
of a subcommittee

402
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,120
once a year it's not enough

403
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,880
right and for people who are not in

404
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,959
public companies i've spoken to people

405
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,600
who've never got in front of their board

406
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,959
or if they did it was for 20 seconds

407
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,240
right

408
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,959
so

409
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,680
is the board structured that way

410
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,079
does the security leadership

411
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,320
have direct access to the board of

412
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,440
directors

413
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,959
i will tell you in my in one of my

414
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,800
previous roles

415
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,720
i was not allowed to engage the

416
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,839
directors on the board directly without

417
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,079
legal being present to make sure i was

418
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,440
saying the right thing

419
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,959
this independence was missing

420
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,519
segregation of duties applies to board

421
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,199
reporting as much as it does to

422
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,480
privileged accounts for i.t

423
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,839
administrators

424
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,440
okay

425
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,399
so think about how you're organized

426
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,560
and then think about how you can improve

427
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,600
it

428
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,240
first thing is if you're not engaging

429
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,880
your directors when they come onto your

430
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,079
board

431
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,480
you're missing out on an opportunity

432
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,199
be part of board directors and by the

433
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:27,920
way

434
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,240
ceos and everyone in the c-suites be

435
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,000
part of their on-boarding plan

436
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,600
explain

437
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
what your company does

438
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,920
because you know what they won't know

439
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,040
explain how security

440
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,800
helps what your company does

441
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,240
explain what you've done in security in

442
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,160
in the past explain your industry

443
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,920
explain your vertical what are the risks

444
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,240
what are the threat actors

445
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,160
right

446
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,480
let them know what's normal and what's

447
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,519
not here's why you need to do this most

448
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,600
directors who get appointed to boards of

449
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,880
directors

450
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,480
come from other industries

451
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,560
and other industries don't do security

452
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,240
the way you do

453
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,639
i went from a wall street bank to a

454
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,680
research university

455
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,839
oh my god the culture shock was

456
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,519
awful i now work for cisco and the

457
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,519
president of the ohio state university

458
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,000
sits on the board at cisco

459
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,920
do you think she thinks about technology

460
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,800
risk

461
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,880
the same way that a silicon valley

462
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,800
person would think about technology risk

463
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,519
probably not right is she going to think

464
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,279
about security the way you would want

465
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,399
her to

466
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,279
maybe

467
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,880
you don't know unless you're part of her

468
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,560
onboarding plan

469
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,519
right

470
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,320
so

471
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,399
directors will come with their own

472
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,120
assumptions about what is normal

473
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,600
high value low margins

474
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,480
whatever right

475
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,600
offer to your boards

476
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,759
to provide them white glove security

477
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,839
services what do i mean by that

478
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,280
directors on boards are often personally

479
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,280
at risk and targeted by threat actors

480
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,799
because they have access to a lot of

481
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,880
information and they're just sort of

482
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,119
personally they tend to be high-profile

483
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,559
individuals

484
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,559
what are you doing to secure them at

485
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,919
home

486
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,599
what are you doing to secure them as

487
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,079
they engage with your organization as a

488
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,679
board director

489
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,520
do you give mfa

490
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,280
to your board members

491
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,840
or is that too much you know conflict

492
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,160
right so think about that

493
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,880
and make sure when you're on board with

494
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,120
that director

495
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,720
that you let them know that you're going

496
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,559
to be contacting them that they should

497
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,840
expect you

498
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,520
to contact them

499
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,960
regularly

500
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,400
updates on what's happening in the

501
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,679
industry how does log4j affect them the

502
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,919
gift that keeps on giving for a j

503
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,440
right

504
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,000
engage them in tabletop exercises i was

505
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,520
doing a round table with a whole bunch

506
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,240
of

507
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,760
um i did three or four round tables

508
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,080
across the u.s last year about

509
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,600
cyber insurance as it turns out

510
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,679
note to self

511
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,400
very expensive lots of exclusions

512
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,760
can't be trusted

513
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,120
have you talked to your board about that

514
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,480
yet because they expect you to have

515
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,799
cyber insurance yeah

516
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,320
um

517
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,840
there was somebody in the tabletop

518
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,720
exercise who would i thought this was a

519
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,000
career limiting move but i'll throw it

520
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,160
out there for your thinking they would

521
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,039
do a tabletop exercise with the c-suite

522
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,720
and they would invite a board of

523
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,760
director

524
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,080
to attend the tabletop exercise without

525
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,840
telling the c-suite ahead of time

526
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,520
ballsy

527
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,600
career limiting move maybe but it's a

528
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,240
it's a thing right how are we engaging

529
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,679
boards of directors do they know what

530
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,240
their role is in an incident

531
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,120
do you know what they think is material

532
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,039
enough that they should know ahead of

533
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,400
time

534
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,559
that they should be the first group to

535
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,840
be told not the last group to be told

536
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,880
right so do your tabletop exercises have

537
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,080
regular meetings with them

538
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,799
make sure they're trained up

539
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,480
one of the ways to think about that by

540
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,440
the way

541
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,919
is chances are most board directors sit

542
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,520
on more than one board

543
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,720
and if they're coming to you they've

544
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,960
probably already served on another board

545
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,919
who's the cso of that organization

546
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,480
find the csos that support your

547
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,960
directors in other places and find out

548
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,039
what they're telling those directors

549
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,240
because you don't want to waste their

550
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,679
time telling them something they already

551
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,600
know

552
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,799
so think about that kind of stuff

553
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,400
so

554
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,000
four

555
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,840
board presentations

556
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,000
you get 20 csos in a room even if

557
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,200
they're from the same industry i

558
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,480
guarantee you they're giving board

559
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,919
presentations in a different way

560
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,160
some people like warlow text some people

561
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,840
like dashboards

562
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,760
some people don't like slides at all

563
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,360
they'll give a written report ahead of

564
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,120
time and then just be there to answer

565
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,720
questions

566
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,200
you're going to have to decide

567
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,280
for yourself

568
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,320
what needs to go in front of the board

569
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,240
but i will suggest to you that the first

570
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,360
thing you need to do is to establish a

571
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,320
trust

572
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,840
relationship

573
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,159
personally between your security

574
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,679
leadership

575
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,640
and your board of directors

576
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,880
the first thing they want to know is is

577
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,720
the person sitting in the chair doing

578
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,559
this report to me

579
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,320
credible

580
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,840
can i trust what they're telling me are

581
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,200
they going to tell me the truth or are

582
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,039
they going to tell me the politically

583
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,720
correct thing that's going to hide

584
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,799
information from me so i can't make a

585
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,679
good leadership decision

586
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,960
they're going to want to know that which

587
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,480
is why by the way you want to get them

588
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
as part of onboarding you want to have

589
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,240
met as many of the board as you can

590
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,520
before you have to present to them

591
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,799
formally

592
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,640
but they have to trust you

593
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,559
personally and if you're reporting to

594
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,159
someone who reports to the board like if

595
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,000
you're an incident responder

596
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,320
the information you give up has to be

597
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,799
completely trustworthy as well so think

598
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,320
about the information

599
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,480
feeds that your security leadership is

600
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,320
getting

601
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,000
the other thing is

602
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,840
security is not

603
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,520
problematic at any point in time

604
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,919
there's always a story to be told

605
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,760
where did we begin

606
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,840
where are we

607
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,360
now and where

608
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,640
are we going

609
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,640
this is the story that you need to tell

610
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,559
i learned a lesson the hard way when i

611
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,240
was a cso at a university

612
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,720
my leadership if you think about people

613
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,240
who run a university they're all

614
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,280
academics anyone here from a university

615
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,360
okay so feel free to

616
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,080
call me if i say something wrong

617
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,440
leadership at a university are all phds

618
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,120
which means they've spent at least eight

619
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,720
years of their lives doing data

620
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,320
analytics

621
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,600
you do not

622
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,799
present to a university board

623
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,360
using data first

624
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,280
because the first thing they want to do

625
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,080
is question your methodology

626
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,080
and you never get to the point

627
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,559
you cut you do your data analytics you

628
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,640
have it in your back pocket but you

629
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,799
start by telling a story

630
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,559
you tell them what you want them to feel

631
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,360
about the security program

632
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,120
and then when they ask for it if they

633
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,200
ask for it most of the time they won't

634
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,559
ask for it because they shouldn't be in

635
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,720
the weeds because their job is to govern

636
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,400
strategy not to manage operations

637
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,000
but if they ask for it then you have the

638
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,960
data

639
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,840
okay

640
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,240
but always always

641
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,159
tell a story and if you are in an

642
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,400
organization that wants data make sure

643
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,240
the data is telling the story you want

644
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,360
it to tell

645
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,960
i had a friend that referred to metrics

646
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,440
as jiggery and pokery

647
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,360
 your metrics to tell the story

648
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,720
you want to tell

649
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,640
now it should be a true story i'm not

650
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,200
saying lie with your metrics

651
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,520
but make sure it tells a story which

652
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,440
means trends over time

653
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
it means using a framework to

654
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,480
demonstrate maturity

655
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,919
right

656
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,159
you can talk about value at risk one of

657
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,000
the things we need to do is to tie our

658
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,320
security programs to the parts of the

659
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,679
business

660
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,760
that a customer facing

661
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,960
and put it in those terms

662
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,720
right so don't talk about it in terms of

663
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,600
the

664
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,919
you know cyber matrix asset classes of

665
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,960
users computers laptops networks

666
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,520
data cloud

667
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,200
they don't care where it is they don't

668
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,279
care what it's on

669
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,440
but they do care about it in terms of

670
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,840
maybe their branch network

671
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,080
if they're retail

672
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,159
or

673
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,640
their vendor partners

674
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,840
i don't know

675
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
you know your industry better than i do

676
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,919
think about how your board and your

677
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,000
c-suite separates your business your

678
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,600
lines of business

679
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,679
your major products those kinds of

680
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,559
things and tell your story that way

681
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,480
and and talk about value at risk in

682
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,960
those ways

683
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,679
benchmarking i hate benchmarking more

684
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,919
often than not it's apples to marsupials

685
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,799
not apples to apples

686
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,120
but sometimes benchmarking can help um

687
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,880
there was a podcast that came out

688
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,720
recently if you're a podcast listener

689
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,880
the podcast is called

690
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,200
um

691
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,400
it's called this thing about

692
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,720
it's a hacker valley podcast

693
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,760
and it's a guy from texas alan alford is

694
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,080
the host you can go google allen he did

695
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,200
a podcast recently with andy ellis

696
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,720
they were talking about reporting to the

697
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,039
board

698
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,600
one of the benchmarks you can do is if

699
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,120
you have external vendors that are

700
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,919
coming and pen testing your environment

701
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,360
or if you have a bug bounty program

702
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,080
and one of the questions you can ask is

703
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,960
would

704
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,960
my with these people have found this

705
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,520
problem in my peers organization do they

706
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,760
find these problems elsewhere or are

707
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,159
they just finding it here or do they

708
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,000
find it elsewhere but they didn't find

709
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,760
it here

710
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,919
right that's a valuable benchmark

711
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,480
because it will say things like we're

712
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,000
doing things well

713
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,600
or we're doing things about as well as

714
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,960
everybody else

715
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,960
or we're not doing as well as everybody

716
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,840
else

717
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,640
right

718
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,080
but just doing things like are we

719
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,320
spending enough on security do we have

720
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,559
the right head count

721
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,520
doesn't tell them anything

722
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,440
financial services spends a ton

723
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,799
on security higher education does not

724
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,640
what does it serve me to tell the higher

725
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,799
education board that we don't spend

726
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,720
enough on security if everybody else in

727
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,400
higher ed is also not spending enough on

728
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,440
security what does the metric benchmark

729
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,240
mean

730
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,480
right so you've got to find value in the

731
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,520
benchmarking right and give your board a

732
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,440
takeaway no one thinks about giving

733
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,679
homework to board members

734
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,679
but feel free to do that because they

735
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,520
want to learn as much as you right so if

736
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,440
there is another white paper you can put

737
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,120
in front of them that's going to help

738
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,200
them better understand give it to them

739
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,279
ask them to read it

740
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,440
ask them to go to talk to their peers

741
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,880
about what they're hearing and come back

742
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,039
to you with any questions

743
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,880
right

744
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,120
ask them

745
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,600
what else do they want to know from you

746
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,320
or your team

747
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,360
okay so some questions to think about

748
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,120
for the board give them homework

749
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:50,840
all

750
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,240
right um some recommendations for your

751
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,919
board if they're not already doing these

752
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,679
things right

753
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,520
often you're going to give your board a

754
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,480
whole

755
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,039
like wad of paper that they read before

756
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,400
the board meetings most of the time they

757
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,320
do read those board meeting

758
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,400
minutes and and pre-reads and those

759
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,240
kinds of things so it's worth doing

760
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,000
don't just wait for the big presentation

761
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,080
give them the stuff ahead of time

762
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,640
but ask them to follow up with you on a

763
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,960
one-on-one to explain it because again

764
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,039
security is nuanced it is not

765
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,559
straightforward and the words you put on

766
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,480
the page don't mean the same thing to

767
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,480
them that they mean to you so

768
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,640
follow-up's really useful

769
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,880
ask them to meet with the c-suite to

770
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,880
talk about what you presented to the

771
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,520
board and even better ask them to ask

772
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,320
you to be present at that meeting

773
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,200
can be helpful right

774
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,880
and ask them what their concerns are and

775
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,640
find ways to incorporate those into

776
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,120
tabletop exercises or your chaos

777
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,039
engineering protocols or whatever

778
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,880
however you're managing that

779
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,200
okay

780
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,600
some things to watch out for

781
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,360
do not varnish the truth

782
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,080
um there's a lot of actions coming out

783
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,840
of various governments now that are

784
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,919
making the board members personally

785
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,679
liable for cyber security at their

786
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,919
organizations i don't know about you but

787
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,440
i don't you can't pay me enough money to

788
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,279
be personally liable for cyber security

789
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,360
at public organizations

790
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,120
and yet they are

791
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,919
right

792
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,880
so you must you must

793
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,640
give them

794
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,840
the truth and there will be a situation

795
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,720
i guarantee it where you have to give

796
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,120
them news that the c-suite does not want

797
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,480
them to get

798
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,000
and you've got to decide if that's the

799
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,600
hill you're going to die on or not

800
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,320
okay and i guarantee you you will face

801
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,399
that question there will be something i

802
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,440
had somebody a board secretary who

803
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,039
pulled out a whole paragraph out of one

804
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,559
of my reports to the board because he

805
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,480
thought that was just

806
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,240
didn't make the the management suite

807
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,159
look very good

808
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,039
right

809
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,440
you have to decide about that

810
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,039
so you must watch out for those

811
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,000
gatekeepers as part of your stakeholder

812
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,159
group if there are people who manage

813
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,080
messaging to the board

814
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,720
they are your stakeholder now you must

815
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,880
become friends with them they must

816
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,559
understand what you're doing because

817
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,000
otherwise they will think all you're

818
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,159
doing is trashing the c-suite to the

819
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,480
board

820
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,600
so manage your gatekeepers

821
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,120
leverage your vendors and your partners

822
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,720
and i say that not just because i work

823
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,600
for a vendor your vendor has insight

824
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,640
into the industry and into the community

825
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,559
that you may not have

826
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,559
so leverage your vendors for these kinds

827
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,000
of things here

828
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,440
vendors can also help with board

829
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,200
exercises and by the way if you are

830
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,679
lucky enough to have cyber insurance use

831
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,720
your cyber insurance contract to get

832
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,600
services like running tabletop exercises

833
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,039
and stuff like that

834
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,880
bring as much value as you can out of

835
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,360
your cyber insurance contracts because i

836
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,640
guarantee you they're not going to pay

837
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,520
up when you get breached so think about

838
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,520
that

839
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,639
so where do you go from here

840
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,039
decide how you're going to talk to your

841
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,600
vendor to talk to your board

842
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,000
okay have a strategy for that as much as

843
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,600
you have a strategy for your phishing

844
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,679
campaigns or your vulnerability

845
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,000
management program or whatever you must

846
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,840
be intentional about how you communicate

847
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,480
to the board what is material enough

848
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,880
that you have to contact the board that

849
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,120
you have to contact the board not the

850
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,360
ceo not the c-suite not the whoever

851
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,200
you

852
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,679
what's material enough for that

853
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,000
describe your outcomes not your

854
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,200
capabilities when you're talking

855
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,760
okay again make sure that when you do

856
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,520
talk about cyber security you're talking

857
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,679
about it aligned to the way the business

858
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,200
is structured

859
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,960
and tell stories lots and lots of times

860
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,840
so that's all i have for you today and i

861
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,360
will open it up for questions

862
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,479
hopefully i didn't scare you

863
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:10,270
