1
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,040
all right good morning everyone

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,320
thank you for showing your commitment to

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,840
the first conference showing up early on

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,640
the friday morning i know how it is uh

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,080
to get things started off today we're

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,840
going to hear from mr tony curtly from

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,199
secureworks who's going to talk to us

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,359
about the ransomware stages of grief

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,359
just a couple of reminders this is tlp

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,279
white down here as the sign says in the

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,080
front

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,800
also if you have any uh um audio things

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,558
enabled on your devices and whatnot ask

14
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,559
that you silence those for the duration

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,960
of the presentation and then uh we'll

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,719
save all questions at the end and then

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,920
if you do have a question for mr

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,280
currently at that time you can step up

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,120
to one of the microphones and we'll

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,559
we'll handle it that way so without

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,640
further ado i will turn the stage over

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,559
to mr curtly and let you take it from

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,959
there sir

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,399
thanks josh

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,559
and thank you guys for thanks you guys

26
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,640
for your commitment here on a friday

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,519
morning i appreciate you uh

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,400
indulging me to talk about this topic

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,320
um so

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,520
this isn't just another ransomware

31
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,119
uh discussion it's about emotions

32
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,479
and so

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,040
not everyone has had the horror of

34
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,280
going through a ransomware incident but

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,360
everyone has experienced emotions so

36
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,479
today we're going to put emotions in the

37
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,400
context of the ransomware situation

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,479
to and

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,159
talk about how

40
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,079
we can speed through the emotions of the

41
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,119
ransomware situation to get to a good

42
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,720
place

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,040
so let's start off with what our

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,280
emotions

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,320
in their book discovering psychology

46
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,479
don hockenberry sandra hockenberry

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,119
suggests that emotions are

48
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,240
a

49
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,159
complex psychological state that

50
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,040
involves three distinct components

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,840
a subjective experience something that

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,200
happens to you

53
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,000
a physiological response how you feel

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,840
about that experience and then a

55
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,038
behavioral

56
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,920
or expressive response

57
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,800
so

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,599
let's talk about how emotions affect

59
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,760
memory

60
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,840
many of you can remember memorable

61
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,879
events

62
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,680
that

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,160
have happened in your life i distinctly

64
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,560
remember the day the birth of my first

65
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,440
child

66
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,200
it was a sunny day and as we were

67
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,680
driving to the hospital i remember the

68
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,319
song from you two a beautiful day was

69
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,400
playing on the radio i remember that

70
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,239
like it was yesterday

71
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,519
similarly

72
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,080
i remember exactly where i was and what

73
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,440
i was doing on 9 11. i was at work

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,680
drawing on a whiteboard when someone a

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,879
co-worker

76
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,160
explained to me that the

77
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,360
[Music]

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,280
one of the twin towers had a plane fly

79
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,000
into it many of you can relate to this

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,480
as you can remember exactly what where

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,440
you were under what circumstances

82
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,760
when 9 11 happened

83
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,879
yet

84
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,680
how many of us forget what we

85
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,239
had for breakfast this morning

86
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,480
or yesterday what we did yesterday

87
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,280
i say all this to demonstrate that

88
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,200
strong emotions trigger memory

89
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,120
so remember this i'm going to come back

90
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,920
to it at the end

91
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,599
so let me set the stage here a little

92
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,640
bit

93
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,760
you are a cio of a multinational

94
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,319
manufacturing company

95
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,319
on a saturday morning your director of

96
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,640
infrastructure wakes you up with a phone

97
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,519
call saying that many of your systems

98
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,480
across the world have been encrypted

99
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,599
your erp system your key production

100
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,879
systems

101
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,480
even your file servers have been

102
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,680
encrypted

103
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,000
employees can't get to the things that

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,319
they need to do their jobs

105
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,200
and your company stands to lose millions

106
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,400
per day until you can recover from this

107
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,680
situation

108
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,159
you may even have customers that walk

109
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,480
away from the situation if you can't

110
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,720
recover quickly

111
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,639
so what are the feelings that you

112
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,918
experience

113
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,918
receiving that phone call you might

114
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:22,960
think

115
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,120
how did how did this happen how did we

116
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,520
let this happen to us

117
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,440
what am i going to tell the board in the

118
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,880
executive team

119
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,120
about you know getting into this

120
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,360
situation

121
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,880
how i've never

122
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,560
been through this before so how do i

123
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,880
even organize a response

124
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,360
how do i rally my team to respond to

125
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,199
this

126
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,960
am i going to have a job when this is

127
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,160
over

128
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,960
so that's a very emotional response

129
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,520
in question that a cio might ask

130
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,600
themselves

131
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,759
and then lastly i think i'm going to be

132
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,360
sick or i think i'm going to have a

133
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,080
panic attack

134
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,440
truthfully the the truth is that person

135
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,720
unless they've been through the

136
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,120
situation before doesn't know what to

137
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,840
expect

138
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,080
but in put it in the context of

139
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,280
the

140
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,280
incident response life cycle

141
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,199
they can expect that containment is

142
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,759
going to be measured in hours or days

143
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,039
hours on

144
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:27,840
the

145
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,680
the positive side and days on the

146
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,360
negative side

147
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,759
eviction or eradication is measured in

148
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,800
days

149
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,919
but recovery is measured in weeks and a

150
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,919
lot of companies who fall victim to

151
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,160
ransomware don't realize that it is a

152
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,720
long process you can't recover

153
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,560
by the weekend

154
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,479
to get back into business by monday

155
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,240
so in this situation when we get called

156
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,120
at the secure works ir team we send an

157
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,120
incident commander to

158
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,919
on-site if possible but in the initial

159
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,400
discussion with the victim

160
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
we do a few things we have a few

161
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,280
objectives

162
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,520
first is to calm the situation calm the

163
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,600
person down the people down that we're

164
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,360
speaking to

165
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,280
explain the process that we're going to

166
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,639
go through to help them through the

167
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,080
situation

168
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,319
set expectations on how long it's going

169
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,080
to take and what it's going to take what

170
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,319
level of effort to recover

171
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,280
and give them confidence that we have

172
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,039
done this before we know what we're

173
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,120
doing and we're going to get them

174
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,600
through this we got their back

175
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,520
all of this helps

176
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,199
with the situation and get off to the

177
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,600
right start but it doesn't take away the

178
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,160
emotions

179
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,000
victims often

180
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,840
face multiple levels of extortion in

181
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,880
ransomware we all know about the

182
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,000
encryption the data breach

183
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,880
but oftentimes we have other forms of

184
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,880
extortion in the form of

185
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,460
the threat actor threatening to

186
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,840
[Music]

187
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,280
make public the situation to the press

188
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,599
to the employees of the company

189
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,280
and to the customers of the victim

190
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,560
so uh i have an audio clip that

191
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,319
demonstrates this

192
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,960
this is from an actual uh

193
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,280
ransomware engagement engagement that my

194
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,199
team led

195
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,960
and uh in it

196
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,880
the threat actor is leaving a voicemail

197
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,680
for the ceo of the victim company

198
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,560
and

199
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,280
there's some blank parts in the audio

200
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,520
clip that's where we redacted the

201
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,720
details from the victim company so have

202
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,120
a listen

203
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,319
hello

204
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,520
my name is michael and i'm from

205
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,680
hacker group

206
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,800
recently we hacked your servers and

207
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,400
right now we have

208
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,520
over 100 gigabytes of your sensitive

209
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,520
data

210
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,800
we will keep silent and

211
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,919
for now no one will know about this leak

212
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,599
from your company

213
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,440
until we will finish our negotiations

214
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,840
we don't want to harm your business no

215
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,280
more

216
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,080
we don't want you to lose money

217
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,280
to make

218
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,120
reputation losses or something else

219
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,160
our aim is to get some benefits from you

220
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,840
some payment which will be

221
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,120
affordable and

222
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,639
you can get your

223
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,919
data back within one day with us

224
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,559
and as a bonus we will provide a back

225
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,559
door defense

226
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,880
so no one could ever hack you again

227
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,039
in case of your refusal to cooperate we

228
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,200
will run a great damage to your business

229
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,839
you will lose 10 times more in court due

230
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,240
to violation on the laws and gdpr in

231
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,399
your partner's data leak

232
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,360
we will inform your employees your

233
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,440
partners and clients

234
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,600
government and media about this leak

235
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
from your company

236
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,720
if you will go to police or fbi they

237
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,600
will never pay for your losses

238
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,440
but you will have one

239
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,480
and not even one

240
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,160
as i said we don't want that to happen

241
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,800
that's not our aim so let's get to

242
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,399
negotiations

243
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,800
in order to start negotiations with us

244
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,200
there is only one option

245
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,480
two steps first step go to your server

246
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,360
take your it guy and go to your server

247
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,240
and find any folder you can open

248
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,959
open any of those folders and there you

249
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,399
will see a file

250
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,920
txt

251
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,839
that's a text file

252
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,680
it's not a hack tool

253
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,240
we already have what we wanted to have

254
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,640
so just open this file and you will see

255
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,080
instruction

256
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,800
there will be a link to a special tour

257
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,959
browser chat

258
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,480
and your id in that chat so you need to

259
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,839
go to the link and type and paste your

260
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,839
id and there you will see a chat in tor

261
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,920
browser type their hello or anything

262
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,760
else and

263
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,680
and you will get response soon from us

264
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,160
so we are waiting for you in the chat

265
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,560
goodbye

266
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,600
thank you michael i'll be waiting for

267
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,000
that backdoor protection so that we're

268
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,959
never hacked again

269
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,279
um

270
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,399
that uh

271
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,600
is a very

272
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,920
it's rare that we get this but

273
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,560
it's it's kind of exciting artifact to

274
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,240
pull from an engagement and it

275
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,680
demonstrates a very in a very real way

276
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,439
kind of what companies are up against

277
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,160
so at secureworks incident response we

278
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,040
have responded to hundreds of ransomware

279
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,920
engagements and

280
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,200
given that we have a wide aperture on

281
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,640
the the tactics techniques procedures

282
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,160
and tradecraft

283
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,920
of the threat actors

284
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
but we also have

285
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,560
observed a wide range of emotional

286
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,519
responses from the victims

287
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,839
in my role as director of incident

288
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,200
command

289
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,000
i have exposure to all of these because

290
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,320
my team leads the response to these

291
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,680
engagements

292
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,760
and so we have

293
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,160
developed a loose association to the

294
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,959
kubler-ross model and the stages of

295
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,359
grief

296
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,959
the the model was developed in 1969

297
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,160
by

298
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
elizabeth kubler-ross

299
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,720
and i learned yesterday that

300
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
from and cook that that's the same year

301
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,440
tcpip was invented

302
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
and which is depressing to me because

303
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,920
that means i too am older than tcpip

304
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,160
so here's the here's the model you see

305
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,920
on the screen

306
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,600
we have denial

307
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,440
which let me just

308
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,320
put this into context this

309
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,279
model was originally created for someone

310
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,519
who is facing death like a terminal

311
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,120
illness

312
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,279
so in the beginning they have denial

313
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,120
avoidance confusion shock fear

314
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,000
then comes anger like how could this

315
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,839
have happened to me frustration anxiety

316
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:22,839
and then

317
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,760
depression which

318
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,920
is demonstrated by helplessness

319
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,360
hostility

320
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
being overwhelmed

321
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,920
then bargaining reaching out to to

322
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,720
people to tell the story to

323
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,560
maybe to ask for help

324
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,600
and then finally acceptance

325
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,800
so

326
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,200
kubler says kubler-ross says that the

327
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,680
stages may be out of order people

328
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,279
experience grief in different ways

329
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,680
and some of these stages can be

330
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,399
experienced together some may be skipped

331
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,839
altogether

332
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,399
and kubler-ross also states that

333
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,560
the process shouldn't be accelerated

334
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,120
that everyone grieves in their own way

335
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,360
and the

336
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,519
the individual should be left to their

337
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,880
own grief

338
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,200
and the time it takes them to

339
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,800
reach acceptance

340
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,880
however in the case of ransomware i

341
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,040
disagree with that i'm going to show you

342
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,920
how reaching the acceptance stage of

343
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,399
grief is

344
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,440
imperative in affecting a speedy

345
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,639
recovery

346
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,600
because the victim organization can make

347
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,920
pragmatic decisions once they reach the

348
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,319
acceptance stage of grief in ransomware

349
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,920
so let's first talk about denial

350
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,399
the victim organization i'm going to

351
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,160
mainly put this in the context of

352
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,000
leadership because

353
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,440
leadership is

354
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,800
heavily a heavy influencer in the

355
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,399
response actions

356
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,680
so

357
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,240
a leader might be asking themselves how

358
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,079
could this happen to us

359
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,120
and for an assertive cio or cso they

360
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,120
demand answers they want answers right

361
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,560
away

362
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,720
another question is what is the impact

363
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,199
how much have we been impacted and

364
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,000
sometimes that's hard to quantify

365
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,800
the victims that we see are typically

366
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,079
lower on the maturity model than

367
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,120
some organizations so as such

368
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,480
they don't have good

369
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,000
a good handle on their control

370
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,160
environment or their assets

371
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,160
some don't even know where their compute

372
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,880
assets are or their information assets

373
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,839
and that uh seriously impedes uh the

374
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,920
response process

375
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,920
so in the fog of war

376
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,000
they start to take immediate action they

377
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,959
do what they think needs to be done

378
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,320
which often includes resetting passwords

379
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,240
and rebuilding machines that have been

380
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,639
encrypted

381
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,920
and

382
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,680
those actions

383
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,360
put out of the out of the process can be

384
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
and if they're unguided they can be very

385
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,079
unproductive

386
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,839
in

387
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,959
as a matter of fact if

388
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,800
outside of the process

389
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,639
and some things being done before

390
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,639
containment is achieved

391
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,040
sometimes will have to be redone

392
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,720
because the threat actor may come back

393
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,279
in and re-encrypt systems that have been

394
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,320
rebuilt

395
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,959
and that is what you don't want

396
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:25,760
so

397
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,160
organizations tend to in this state

398
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,519
start sprinting and just doing stuff

399
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,600
but what they need to do is just take a

400
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,480
deep breath try to assess the situation

401
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,399
and call for help

402
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,240
especially if the organization hasn't

403
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,160
been through this before and i don't

404
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,519
think anyone wants to go through it

405
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,880
twice or more

406
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,000
next comes anger

407
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,360
and this is where we see finger-pointing

408
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,440
the blame game

409
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,680
deflection of blame

410
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,560
jockeying among co-workers

411
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,880
and job preservation especially in the

412
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,079
part of

413
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,440
the security leadership we've seen cso's

414
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,680
be very defensive

415
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,480
and

416
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,720
not taking responsibility for the

417
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,639
situation

418
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,040
ultimately the victim organization feels

419
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,519
violated as if their

420
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,279
personal belongings have been stolen

421
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,880
from their home and if that's happened

422
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,759
to you you know how that feels

423
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,880
the

424
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,639
leadership also has ownership of systems

425
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,480
a cio it's

426
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,959
feels an ownership of the whole

427
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,120
network environment

428
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,600
and at times anger is con hard to

429
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,440
control in these situations for some

430
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,399
people

431
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,720
but the danger is that anger can be

432
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,600
contagious to the team members

433
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,399
and it can cause some loyalty issues it

434
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,880
can cause some productivity issues

435
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,279
so how leaders handle this situation and

436
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,800
handle their anger

437
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,440
can cause people to either be less or

438
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,160
more loyal

439
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,720
there's a bonding that can occur

440
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,799
through these situations if handled

441
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,199
correctly which can cause people to be

442
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,480
more loyal after the incident

443
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,000
so

444
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,240
many of you have been have participated

445
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,959
in lessons learned exercises and part of

446
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,240
that is

447
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,839
having a nameless blameless

448
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,640
environment so that everyone can share

449
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,919
what they know

450
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,720
freely and not be worried about

451
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,480
repercussions

452
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,520
so leaders in this ransomware situation

453
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,640
should talk

454
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,280
to squash any talk of blame

455
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,880
among the staff

456
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
because ultimately the workers are

457
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,080
grieving about this too

458
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,679
next comes depression

459
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,679
this might be this might happen when

460
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,720
root cause is uh obtained in the

461
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,240
investigation

462
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,280
uh

463
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,600
an administrator may realize oh this is

464
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,679
my fault because i didn't implement a

465
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,240
control effectively or

466
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,480
something i did cause the threat actor

467
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,799
to get in and encrypt our systems

468
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,240
they might have a feeling that they're

469
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,000
going to get fired

470
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
and they may just think i should give up

471
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,360
now uh this is all my fault i'm done in

472
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,120
my career

473
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
uh it can also happen when things go

474
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,720
wrong when you have a setback in the

475
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,280
response maybe there's a dependency that

476
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,240
someone forgot about that needs to be

477
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,840
implemented before

478
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,919
platforms and operating systems can be

479
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,520
rebuilt

480
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,840
also depression can be accompanied by

481
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
anger we often see

482
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,160
these two things go together

483
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,200
it's a natural response when you feel

484
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,960
like uh

485
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
anguish and despair

486
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,360
sometimes some people respond by turning

487
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,080
to anger and take it out on the

488
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,400
staff

489
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,080
when this happens this is where the

490
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,200
professionals need to step up um and by

491
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,600
professionals i mean the consultants

492
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,039
that are used to dealing with this

493
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,240
situation

494
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,520
i've had to pull a cso or an i.t

495
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,160
director aside and say this is starting

496
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
to look you know like a

497
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,200
a bad environment a bad culture we need

498
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,320
to start to institute a culture of

499
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,720
reassurance and

500
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,000
to turn around the productivity

501
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,160
because ultimately everybody is a

502
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,200
critical part of the team

503
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,880
next we have bargaining

504
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,799
this usually happens once you start to

505
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,760
gain momentum on the response in the

506
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,280
recovery

507
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,160
the

508
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,840
cio or cso wants to do a hard push and

509
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,240
bargains with their staff if we could

510
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,039
just

511
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,200
put the pedal to the metal we can get

512
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,760
through this more quickly

513
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,320
they may say things like i promised the

514
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,480
board that we would be recovered by

515
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,080
wednesday or

516
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,320
we're losing money every day that we're

517
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,000
down

518
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,840
so they bargained with staff to work

519
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,520
extra hours

520
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,400
uh this is very dangerous because it is

521
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,440
a long game and if you push your staff

522
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,200
too hard then

523
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,120
uh they're gonna burn out and they won't

524
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,240
be productive to you and the onboard

525
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,520
staff aside from third parties on board

526
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,240
staff are critical in these situations

527
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,000
because they have the institutional

528
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,280
knowledge

529
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,039
in fact

530
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,120
when we bring in third parties to

531
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,360
recover in a situation like this i

532
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,919
always tell the victim organization

533
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,000
use that use the third parties to do the

534
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,760
commodity task building infrastructure

535
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,159
building operating systems the things

536
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,880
that exist in every environment and can

537
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,880
be done by anyone

538
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,159
leverage your staff for the things that

539
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,520
leverage their

540
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,840
institutional knowledge like knowledge

541
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,559
of applications knowledge of systems

542
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,799
knowledge of business systems and their

543
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,520
dependencies

544
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,799
also

545
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,799
leadership needs to establish an

546
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,320
operational tempo early in the response

547
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,000
that includes

548
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,039
work hours work shifts with built-in

549
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,360
rest so to make sure that the staff is

550
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,400
fresh when they're on the job

551
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,480
lack of sleep combined with a high

552
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,280
stress environment greatly impact

553
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,280
productivity

554
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
last we have acceptance we finally

555
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,039
arrived here right

556
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,520
this is where you want to be it's where

557
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,000
the real momentum begins

558
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,120
uh in the in the recovery effort

559
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,080
and i've only seen one

560
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,240
case where the victim organization

561
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,679
arrived at acceptance quickly

562
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,280
in this situation

563
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,280
the i.t director they didn't have a

564
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,600
security staff it was a small company

565
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,679
the i.t director actually checked

566
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,919
himself into the hospital

567
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,200
after he had a panic attack on day one

568
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,919
i arrived on site on day two

569
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,720
and reported to the cfo who the i.t

570
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,400
director reported to

571
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,640
he could barely spell i.t

572
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,240
and so he

573
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,400
turned to me and said

574
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,480
give me what i need to get through this

575
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,120
so he gave me implicit trust and and

576
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,960
basically a blank check

577
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,200
so we brought in

578
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,440
our recovery partners to start

579
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,320
immediately on the recovery efforts

580
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,159
and it was the speediest response that

581
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,039
i've experienced

582
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,760
so that's an example of acceptance

583
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,919
reaching acceptance quickly can can

584
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,000
greatly speed the response

585
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,320
and we we bypassed all of the struggle

586
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,200
that i've talked about

587
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,360
so in conclusion i wanted to point out a

588
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,000
few things to remember

589
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,960
first

590
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,280
lean on the experts

591
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,120
we've

592
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,880
companies like ours

593
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,280
have experienced this many many times

594
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,600
and it's not emotional to us anymore

595
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,520
we're like a doctor

596
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,240
triaging patients in a

597
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,480
emergency room we've seen

598
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,720
everything and so it's not as emotional

599
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,559
for us and so the experts the outsiders

600
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,799
that don't own the systems

601
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,039
are like firefighters responding to a

602
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,200
fire in a building

603
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,520
the victim organization is the building

604
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,720
owner

605
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,400
but the firefighters will come put out

606
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,679
the fire

607
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,200
the way they're trained to do and then

608
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,840
leave

609
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,600
so

610
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,320
allow them to help quickly and don't

611
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,159
wait

612
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,640
it is expensive to respond to these

613
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,440
situations but that is what it is we're

614
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,039
not price gouging

615
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,279
and uh we're just trying to help and

616
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,960
cover our cost

617
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,799
and make a little money in the process

618
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,640
but it's not um

619
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,080
there's a little haggling on price

620
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,080
sometimes but that should just be

621
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,360
bypassed it's to cost a lot to

622
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,520
recover from ransomware

623
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,279
next you need to create a no blame

624
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,320
environment this is extremely important

625
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,559
so that people can feel like

626
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,720
there's no danger to them in their jobs

627
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,640
when this is over and they can be more

628
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,799
productive

629
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,200
next manage the response tempo from the

630
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,240
beginning

631
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,480
this should be in everyone's incident

632
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,919
response plan is as an essential element

633
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,960
the the work shifts for 24-hour

634
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,799
operations because this truly is a

635
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,158
24-hour recovery

636
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,880
next

637
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,440
positivity

638
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,120
staying positive in these kinds of

639
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,080
situations affects the the time frame

640
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,000
the productivity and the loyalty of the

641
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,840
staff

642
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,480
i spent a career in the us army and we

643
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,120
had a saying in the army and it was

644
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
embrace the suck

645
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,080
and what that means is we're all in a

646
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,640
bad situation together there's nothing

647
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,120
we can do about being here so let's just

648
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,200
embrace it and get through it together

649
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,840
and it that kind of attitude forms that

650
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,840
bond that going through an adverse

651
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,200
situation can can create

652
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,919
and lastly the best way to avoid this is

653
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,520
to prepare

654
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,720
and i know we all talk about preparation

655
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,360
but the preparation to me is in two

656
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,640
forms

657
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,039
to the left in the right of bang

658
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,440
and what that means is to the left

659
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,000
is implementing controls that will

660
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
detect or prevent

661
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,320
the steps in the kill chain

662
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,799
and then the preparation to the right of

663
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,360
bang in this case to me

664
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,000
means incident response planning

665
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,600
exercising

666
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,960
having and testing backups

667
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,039
and knowing where your assets are

668
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,480
so that you can recover quickly

669
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,600
so in the beginning i talked about

670
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,240
emotions and their effect on memory so

671
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,080
i'm going to leave you with a bonus

672
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,159
stage of grief that is outside the

673
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,000
kubler-ross model

674
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,279
but

675
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,720
the

676
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,440
there is a man david kessler who

677
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,360
co-authored some books with elizabeth

678
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,720
kubler-ross

679
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,600
he wrote a book in 2019 called the sixth

680
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,200
stage of grief

681
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,880
and it is called

682
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,799
finding meaning

683
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:29,679
so

684
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,400
how do we find meaning in having gone

685
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,279
through a ransomware incident

686
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,480
well to me it's simple it is

687
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,760
using the

688
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,760
emotional experience that everyone has

689
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,080
gone through all the way up to the board

690
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,200
to

691
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,279
make improvements to the security

692
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,039
environment

693
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,880
many of you have heard the saying never

694
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,200
let a good incident go to waste i use

695
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,679
that all the time it is so true

696
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,919
especially in the emotional

697
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,039
incident like ransomware

698
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,159
so

699
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,159
that's all i have for you today thank

700
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,760
you for indulging me and talking about

701
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,240
this topic and i'll take any questions

702
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,240
now

703
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:17,390
[Applause]

704
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,159
this is the part i like thank you for

705
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,720
stepping up

706
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,880
thanks for the talk

707
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,559
um uh i can confirm all that you said

708
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,880
from a recent ransomware case that i was

709
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,120
able to handle um

710
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,960
but in your experience what's the time

711
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,240
frame uh for the different stages uh so

712
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,000
sort of for average or you know from

713
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,039
come

714
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,480
stage one till

715
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,559
six maybe yeah

716
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,960
so as i mentioned there there's one case

717
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,159
where i saw an expedited bee line to the

718
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,279
acceptance stage um that was immediate

719
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,240
now we don't normally see that um but

720
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,799
like all things it greatly varies

721
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,039
depending on the culture of the

722
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,360
organization the size

723
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,520
even the geographic distribution if

724
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,679
there is

725
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,399
in

726
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,000
another extreme case a very large

727
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,559
multinational manufacturing company

728
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,520
the

729
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,000
in those environments there is a

730
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,159
higher emphasis on

731
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,279
the hierarchy or of the organization

732
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,640
and things move much slow more slowly

733
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,960
and the culture is really set at the top

734
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,600
there's very authoritative uh management

735
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,279
style and so that would be the other end

736
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,720
of the spectrum

737
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,679
but it all depends on the leadership the

738
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,120
the leaders can set the tone immediately

739
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,320
in those situations and it can

740
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,480
even in large organizations make for a

741
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,760
very rapid response so i don't have a a

742
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,159
good answer for you the stages we try to

743
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,679
get the

744
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,840
the victim to the acceptance stage

745
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,840
immediately like i said in the first

746
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,760
conversation we're trying to set

747
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,279
expectations

748
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,360
so that they can have a picture of what

749
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,840
it what the total response looks like

750
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,159
and that usually helps a great deal in

751
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,240
getting them to acceptance but there's

752
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,200
still some doubt um being an outsider

753
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,640
especially if we haven't ever worked

754
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,039
with that victim before

755
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,000
and so

756
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,760
it just depends on some personalities

757
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,840
and leadership

758
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,000
maybe maybe in addition to to my

759
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,240
question um like because you you made

760
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,279
the comparison the really good

761
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,480
comparison to doctors the emergency room

762
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,120
um like medicine also over the centuries

763
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,960
developed to to create statistics and

764
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,000
since you have

765
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,600
since you

766
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,919
seem to be treating lots of patients

767
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,200
right you know it would be really

768
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,799
interesting to have some statistics per

769
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,480
ransomware family or operator um

770
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,960
like how long it took an average uh i

771
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,080
don't know do you

772
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,679
do you go in that direction or so

773
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,360
because that would be very valuable to

774
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
share with the community yeah experience

775
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,360
and for the business leaders yeah i

776
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,240
think i think the correlation of

777
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,279
ransomware recovery speed is more about

778
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,320
the type of organization than it is the

779
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,399
the threat actor because

780
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,880
honestly the threat actors uh

781
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,679
tactics and tradecraft is doesn't vary

782
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,440
too much

783
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,880
so

784
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,320
in general

785
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,520
i i gave some impression about uh the

786
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,919
different phases and how long they take

787
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,080
we usually see containment within a day

788
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,960
or two uh depending on the victim

789
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,640
organization's capabilities um to to

790
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,320
affect that and it it does largely

791
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,120
depend on the victim's capabilities

792
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,240
recovery i've seen in as little as

793
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,440
a week or two or as long as four months

794
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,000
a large part of that was doing the

795
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,600
password reset for 80 000 accounts so it

796
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,720
just depends on a lot of things

797
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,679
thank you

798
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,679
thanks for the question

799
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,200
thank you for your talk

800
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,679
um how do you see

801
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,320
victims and clients of yours handling

802
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,120
the containment decisions in situations

803
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,440
where the attacker didn't have the

804
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,240
imminent and effect the impact but you

805
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,640
see that the impact is rather coming

806
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,720
because you already know the attacker

807
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,240
has full access to the domain

808
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,000
controllers and established c2

809
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,600
communications how do you see the

810
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,760
clients working in those situations

811
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,640
thank you

812
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,360
thanks for the question uh containment

813
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,559
is

814
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,159
there's there's several options for

815
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,880
containment it depends on a few things

816
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,360
uh and we have different recommendations

817
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,480
depending on the outcome of those uh

818
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,799
factors the first factor is

819
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:43,519
the

820
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,039
victims ability to segment their network

821
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,000
and

822
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,559
and if they have a great ability and and

823
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,880
hardware to do so then we will direct

824
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,480
them to set up a

825
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,960
kind of a red amber green networks the

826
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,440
red being the compromise the amber being

827
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,519
the staging and

828
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,000
cleaning and tooling and then the green

829
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,840
being the sanitized

830
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,799
network

831
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,120
the opposite end of that spectrum is

832
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,440
restoring everything in place in a fully

833
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,679
isolated state

834
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,720
and so you got to contain the threat

835
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,039
actor before you start recovery you

836
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:19,840
can't

837
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,320
allow them to have access to the systems

838
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,519
and so

839
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,399
in the case of that full containment

840
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,320
we usually recommend that if the victim

841
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,760
is fully

842
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,039
impacted

843
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,039
everything is encrypted there's no

844
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,519
services operating anyway so what good

845
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,240
is an internet connection so you isolate

846
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,120
rebuild in place making sure that you're

847
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,559
doing all of the eviction actions before

848
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,159
services are open back up to the

849
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,679
internet

850
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,000
thank you

851
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,080
hi thank you andrew cormac from jisc

852
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,159
i'm intrigued by the idea that the

853
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,360
quickest

854
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,600
getting to acceptance

855
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,840
and i hope i'm not misrepresenting it

856
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,159
was from the person who knew they knew

857
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,559
nothing

858
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,720
that's right that feels like there's

859
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,039
then a bit of a risk

860
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,080
for the organization that has prepared

861
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,399
but has still got caught

862
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,760
that they're going to make this is going

863
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,559
to be amplified because my preparations

864
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,320
didn't work and it struck me there's

865
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,840
some really interesting

866
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,720
management is wrong but communications

867
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,960
around yes what you did is really good

868
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,840
that's going to help

869
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,880
and

870
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,039
again it's not your fault the whether

871
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,640
the the little knowledge might actually

872
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,080
make things worse

873
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,480
well it's intriguing again the in this

874
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,120
case it wasn't that the person lacked

875
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,640
knowledge but it was rather their

876
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,039
attitude towards uh

877
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,600
towards the third party us helping them

878
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,799
and the trust that he placed on us just

879
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,640
the i've seen

880
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,799
csos with

881
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,440
the same attitude they're like i know i

882
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,440
don't know everything i know that

883
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,440
there's going to be gaps in my

884
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,679
response plan

885
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,960
but you

886
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,079
you mr expert i'm paying you to help us

887
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,719
and i expect you to know the pitfalls

888
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,879
that we can fall into and so i'm

889
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,199
trusting you to help us through this

890
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,399
conversely i've seen csos that say that

891
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,679
think they know

892
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,599
uh how to do this and so they

893
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,599
marginalize the expert

894
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,560
and

895
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,359
we

896
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,000
we have to play in those situations too

897
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,679
even though we know in the back of our

898
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,440
mind to try to communicate as best we

899
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,239
can

900
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,679
that you know

901
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,440
this is the way you should be

902
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,079
uh affecting the response so it's more

903
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,800
about attitude than it is knowledge

904
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,839
okay yeah thank you

905
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,800
uh this is my boss everybody

906
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,720
in the fire service we have uh we for

907
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,599
interior firefighter training we like to

908
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,560
do live fire exercises

909
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,240
you find a house that's going to be torn

910
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,920
down you set it on fire you have the

911
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,839
firefighters coming you experience the

912
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,440
it's as realistic as possible because it

913
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,160
is real sounds like a lot of fun yeah um

914
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,160
so to experience you know my experience

915
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,599
in exercises is you never it's never

916
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,640
real enough to experience these emotions

917
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,480
do you have any thoughts is it possible

918
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,640
to construct an exercise which tests

919
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,640
these emotions are really the only way

920
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,640
to experience these emotions to actually

921
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,839
go through a real ransomware case itself

922
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,760
fascinating question

923
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,880
and

924
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,040
in my in the beginning of my career at

925
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,240
secure works starting seven years ago

926
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,800
i used to do exercises for a living

927
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,880
and the one of the things that we made

928
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,200
sure to do in those exercises is to make

929
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,920
this scenario as real as possible

930
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,720
and what that meant was

931
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,440
taking elements of the environment uh

932
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,240
usernames server names application names

933
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,520
and injecting them into the uh scenario

934
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,880
so that it's familiar to the

935
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,960
participants and may conjure that

936
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,480
emotion

937
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,119
as far as a live fire kind of exercise

938
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,240
we we do exercises that we call purple

939
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,119
team exercises where we have a actual

940
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,880
red team

941
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,040
attacking the organization

942
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,680
while a member of our ir team is

943
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,320
evaluating the response with the

944
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
organization's blue team

945
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,520
and

946
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,839
i've never been in a situation i don't

947
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,079
think or seen a situation where we've

948
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,320
done that with ransomware you almost

949
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,680
have to have a lab that you're

950
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,920
encrypting and

951
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,160
testing the recovery actions that way

952
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,560
but it's a good point that the more

953
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,760
realistic exercises are the more

954
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,400
emotions that they conjure up and it

955
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,560
makes it more realistic when people can

956
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,520
feel the emotion associated with the

957
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,960
actions

958
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,079
thanks for the question jeff

959
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,280
again thanks everybody

960
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,950
i appreciate your attention

961
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:16,819
[Applause]
