17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,760
cyber threat intelligence and how we can

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,280
use different methods to

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,640
enhance that

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,410

this is agenda of our session in other

39
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,640
words the map of our journey

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,880
we will give a demonstration and

41
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,320
demonstration

42
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,200
a presentation and demonstration

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,240
after first 2020 we continued our

44
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,759
journey to widen cti applications

45
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,640
one day i got a chance to discuss with a

46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,759
certain japanese law enforcement

47
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,560
practitioners

48
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,038
they have collected a lot of criminal

49
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,200
information i would like to correlate

50
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,360
pieces of information

51
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,319
for example this information includes ip

52
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,520
addresses

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,800
bank accounts and so on

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,959
while i am thinking how to resolve the

55
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,239
case i realize this is common to other

56
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,920
communities

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,800
we decided solving this case would meet

58
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,080
our design topic

59
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,200
first of all i was going to use the 6

60
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,599
format however as you know

61
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,000
playing sticks can handle cyberspace

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
data objects only

63
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,280
sticks can not store real-world data

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,680
like a bank account information

65
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,360
of course i know

66
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,920
6 supports custom objects and we can

67
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,080
extend the format to handle your world

68
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,280
data

69
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,879
additionally i

70
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,120
also know the miss standard

71
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,440
this standard supports many near wild

72
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,920
data to save and collaborate

73
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,920
this data can be exported as 6 3.1 by

74
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,319
using custom objects

75
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,680
i believed

76
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,159
miss standard and custom objects would

77
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,760
solve it however we were simply to naive

78
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,599
okay

79
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,239
after we had discussion uh

80
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,799
i happened to

81
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,200
open a bank account in japan

82
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,120
this is a

83
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,000
bank account application form on

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,360
smartphone

85
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,879
and the first i was asked to provide my

86
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,000
uh

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,840
name in kanji

88
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,959
kind of official version of my name

89
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,480
last name

90
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,519
in kanji and first name in

91
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,879
kanji and then

92
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,400
i also

93
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,120
asked to provide my name in katakana

94
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,879
uh last name and first name

95
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,560
that that is when i realized that um

96
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,680
the problem is not as simple as we

97
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,879
thought

98
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,079
data to open an account uh in the united

99
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,759
states and japan

100
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,639
are

101
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,440
very different and

102
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,120
like two independent islands um

103
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,479
so uh

104
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,280
for u.s accounts uh miss

105
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,000
miss person object is uh

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,919
is it will do for

107
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,759
it uh first name um middle name last

108
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,960
name but not for japanese uh

109
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,560
name

110
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,280
so and uh i'm gonna talk about this

111
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,320
later but uh matching first name values

112
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,160
will not be easy either

113
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,280
so uh let me

114
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,080
give you a little lesson on japanese

115
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,800
before i go into detail

116
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,000
this is free one uh okay so uh

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,039
please

118
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,840
understand that there are a variety of

119
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,320
character sets used

120
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,160
in everyday

121
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,039
everyday japanese writing

122
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,320
so first a kanji character set which is

123
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,960
a chinese characters we borrowed are

124
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,199
from china a hundred or a thousand years

125
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,400
ago

126
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,800
so this is first one

127
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,360
then we have a

128
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,199
character set for phonetic

129
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,840
representation of japanese

130
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,440
which we call katakana

131
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,560
and then this is a double bite version

132
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,039
but we have a

133
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,199
single bite version of katakana

134
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,720
they

135
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,000
they look similar uh for human eyes but

136
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,120
uh

137
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,000
those codes are totally different uh for

138
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,840
our computers

139
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,440
then

140
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,720
we have another phonetic representation

141
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,880
character set which is called hiragana

142
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,960
and

143
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,560
we have alphabet

144
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,039
in double bytes

145
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,120
and alphabet in single bytes um

146
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,160
so this the last one is basically ascii

147
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,160
code um

148
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,840
and so uh

149
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,080
those are

150
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,960
uh used regularly in japanese writing so

151
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
my name in

152
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,520
kanji

153
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,680
katakana double bite

154
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,000
katakana

155
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,840
single bite

156
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,400
hiragana

157
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,120
alphabet double byte

158
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,120
alphabet single byte

159
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,639
so

160
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,319
it is really crazy

161
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,639
so uh

162
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,639
so the problems uh i i realized we

163
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,080
realized is that uh first of all

164
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,919
the names are structured very

165
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,360
differently in the us and japan um

166
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,639
so for

167
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,759
uh to to for

168
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,639
for

169
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,479
u.s bank accounts

170
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,560
i just require

171
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,199
i am required to give first name last

172
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,840
name middle name

173
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,199
but uh in japan to open a bank account

174
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,360
my last name in

175
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,720
kanji

176
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
my first name in kanji

177
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,680
and then

178
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,919
my

179
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,479
last name in katakana

180
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,199
and then my first name in katakana some

181
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,919
uh banks require a

182
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,720
phonetic representation in

183
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,479
hiragana

184
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,759
so that they're very different so uh

185
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,960
first

186
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,360
we encounter this program

187
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,199
and then

188
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,840
secondly so therefore one is to uh

189
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,039
specify which are few too much with

190
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,960
which so in this case uh we decided that

191
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,599
my first name in katakana this is a

192
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,840
phonetic representation so

193
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,919
this is the best

194
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,039
chance to match with this one

195
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,039
first name in uh

196
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,799
us uh us version

197
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,599
uh

198
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,719
how

199
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,479
so that's uh one

200
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,640
one thing we have to do

201
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,279
but then

202
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,839
matching our first name values is not

203
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,560
simple either so uh

204
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,880
because uh this is a phonetic

205
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
representation there are a couple of

206
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,920
ways

207
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,720
to

208
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,450
convert japanese into

209
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,000

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,200
sometimes it's

212
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,000
they are different but i got lucky to

213
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,880
have

214
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,560
the same one for all conversion methods

215
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,079
but the things is

216
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,720
they do not match with a mine in us

217
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,160

this

one

i i picked up uh when

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,480
i was 11th grader

225
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,440
uh

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,320
for

227
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,760
my first passport and i've been using uh

228
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,200
it

229
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,080
uh it for um u.s bank accounts and

230
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,160
bitcoin accounts as well

231
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,360
so uh

232
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,360
and i

233
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,959
and it isn't unusual to use this version

234
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,080
uh

235
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,839
for my name

236
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,600
so uh

237
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,320
those are kind of things that we realize

238
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,040
to uh deal with

239
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,000
when even matching um

240
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,200
us accounts my u.s accounts and

241
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,760
my japanese account

242
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,120
so uh

243
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,519
the matching is

244
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,720
not not science but moreover

245
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,760
an art

246
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,839
a black art

247
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,560
so uh

248
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,839
that's when i realized that uh

249
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,120
we

250
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,000
opened the pandora's box yeah

251
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,440
there are lots of

252
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,160
things coming out of this box but

253
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,279
fortunately we have we had toshi to

254
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,399
close the box yeah thank you

255
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,560
thank you

256
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,640
pandora's box we found many other gaps

257
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,680
to fill

258
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,279
the first case is russian family names

259
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,440
they use the different family names by

260
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,120
gender in russia

261
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,839
for example men use ribinsky as a family

262
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,279
name and women use the libinskaia

263
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,519
some languages are the accent marks

264
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,360
variables

265
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,240
in our country some companies have more

266
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,800
than 40 variation of its name it's crazy

267
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,959
from the aspect of cyber threat

268
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,160
intelligence

269
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,880
we use many areas to specify a threat

270
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,839
tractor

271
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,560
malware and so on

272
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,959
there will be many such cases in other

273
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,760
languages and cultures

274
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,800
therefore we need each to create custom

275
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,200
objects and flexible matching mechanisms

276
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,040
to deal with real-world data

277
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,959
okay this is a map of our last journey

278
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,399
in 2020. we demonstrated ship our

279
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,560
original threat intelligence platform to

280
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,439
bridge human and system cti seamlessly

281
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,920
to close pandora's box we have

282
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,560
implemented six customizer and two

283
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,120
matching mechanisms in a chip

284
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,560
in ship

285
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,120
to overcome these gaps we add three

286
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,519
features in ship

287
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,480
the first one is six customizer

288
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,320
as i mentioned before

289
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,279
stick supports custom objects however

290
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,399
it's up to each chip application

291
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,560
and the user can not handle the custom

292
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,240
objects that the chip can not support

293
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,639
this allows end user to model custom

294
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,959
objects by editing the configuration

295
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,399
file

296
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,040
ship cam models can model the custom

297
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,279
objects by using gui

298
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,519
it is very useful and

299
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,040
easy to understand modeling method

300
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,560
the second one is explicit correlation

301
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,440
there are many fields in your word data

302
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,839
we know it doesn't make sense to match

303
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,399
between a credit card number and a

304
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,680
telephone call telephone number

305
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,920
it is very important to narrow down the

306
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,079
matching range using explicit

307
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,920
correlation because

308
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,399
the correlation match matching consumes

309
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,880
a lot of time

310
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,240
please remember our cover page satomi

311
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,040
satomi is my family name

312
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,160
however in japan satomi is often used as

313
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,720
the first name for women

314
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,800
it doesn't make sense to compare my

315
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,160
family name satomi with the last name

316
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,639
of women satomi

317
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,079
the last one is fuzzy matching

318
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,160
this function can absorb notation

319
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,920
fluctuations

320
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,240
we started to absorb the gaps between

321
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,240
english and japanese as we used to do

322
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,560
now the demo time

323
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,560
i will demonstrate to create the new

324
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,399
custom object model

325
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,600
next

326
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,680
i will configure the fuzzy matching rule

327
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,360
to absorb the notation fluctuations

328
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,920
i will also set the explicit correlation

329
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,120
rules

330
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,079
finally i will show you how matching

331
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,240
between a japanese value and an english

332
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,440
value happens

333
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,680
an end user can set six custom objects

334
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,720
and properties from this page i have

335
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,399
already configured the part of the

336
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,839
exmispo object person on the right side

337
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,720
of course it is a custom object

338
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,160
this model is standardized by misp

339
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,399
you can confirm variation with the nodes

340
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,079
and edges

341
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,560
i'll try to add a pair of custom six

342
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,720
object and some properties

343
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
first of all create the sixth custom

344
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,199
object

345
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,720
okay

346
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,199
fill in the name

347
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,839
and leave the type to object

348
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,720
the app shapes has appeared

349
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,720
this shape shows it is an object

350
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,959
let's create a custom property node

351
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,839
set the type property and fill in the

352
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,079
name

353
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,440
okay the box shape has appeared

354
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,120
it means a property create an edge

355
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,199
create an edge between custom object and

356
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,079
custom property

357
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,519
and drag from object nodes the property

358
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,399
node

359
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,639
the line has appeared with the contains

360
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,000
level

361
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,120
this level is added automatically

362
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,240
now i can add the property to the object

363
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,560
let's create other properties

364
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,600
the second one is

365
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,399
yeah

366
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,519
a kanji family name as you mentioned

367
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,399
before

368
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,600
kanji means chinese character

369
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,920
the third property is

370
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,000
katakana given name

371
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,880
a

372
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,839
katakana political representation of

373
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,959
japanese last one is

374
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,839
a katakana family

375
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,000
connect with edges the average contents

376
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,160
as well

377
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,720
okay i can create custom object and

378
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,079
properties very easily

379
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,320
next i will try to set the explicit

380
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,519
correlation

381
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,399
between the property which i just ex i

382
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,720
just created and the

383
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,440
existing properties oh sorry these

384
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,120
existing properties

385
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,279
the way is very easy

386
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,519
just drag not node to note

387
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,519
fill in the rule name in this case

388
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,399
first name and click just click the ok

389
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,519
button

390
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,279
i will set another rule as well

391
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,440
this case is

392
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,279
a family name

393
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,279
okay i can set two rules

394
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:58,959
next

395
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,639
says the fuzzy matching rules of the

396
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,920
property

397
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,160
click the specified property node and

398
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
click the edit node

399
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,720
the settings dialog window window has

400
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,160
appeared

401
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,880
scroll down

402
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,039
and we can show the fuzzy matching rules

403
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,039
section

404
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,400
check this too much values regardless of

405
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,720
case

406
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,880
katakana hiragana are japanese character

407
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,160
sets

408
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,679
the next size is

409
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,000
the left side is katakana and the right

410
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,200
side is hiragana both of them mean tokyo

411
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,200
which is the japanese capital city

412
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,039
cinca

413
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,440
are also japanese character sets

414
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,600
human beings can judge two values are

415
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,440
the same this one

416
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,840
and this one

417
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,559
however computers usually determine

418
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,720
these values are different

419
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,200
by enabling this rule fuzzy matching to

420
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,600
eat them three these values are the same

421
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,520
japanese english fuzzy matching i will

422
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,039
explain later in detail

423
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,320
this matching is for machines that above

424
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,640
rules can not cover

425
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
to enable the list matching

426
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,640
fill the words that are considered to be

427
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,960
the same value for each line

428
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,120
for example

429
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,240
cafe

430
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,120
and

431
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,520
cafe with an accent mark is treated as

432
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,000
the same

433
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,360
or in the case of cti malware is often

434
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,719
referred to by several names so i added

435
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,880
a mutate clickbot and ice id in another

436
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,480
text area

437
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,559
these three values are treated as the

438
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,879
same

439
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,120
okay we can also use this function to

440
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,000
match between strong and type of values

441
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,960
tokyo is sometimes sometimes this

442
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,320
written as a t-o-k-i-o

443
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,840
by defining

444
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,480
oh sorry

445
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,559
okay

446
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,679
by defining t o k y o and t o k i o

447
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,000
in the same tickes area two values are

448
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,400
matched

449
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,600
now i enable several rules and click

450
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,799
save button

451
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,039
the configuration demo is over

452
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,320
let me explain about 2 6 bundles with

453
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,720
custom object the first bundle is x-miss

454
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,240
object person

455
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,200
this file was exported from mist as 6

456
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,000
2.1

457
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,520
this bundle contains yusuke roi usuke as

458
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,159
his first name yeah this is my first

459
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,200
name

460
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,000
for u.s banks all right

461
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,600
this value consists of alphabets

462
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,440
the second bundle is

463
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,039
yeah

464
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,720
xjp national person

465
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,000
of course these objects are original

466
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,880
by using the ship we can create original

467
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,799
six instances very easily

468
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,520
in this bundle you can find four

469
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,000
properties filled in japanese character

470
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,159
this highlighted word is use actual

471
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,039
japanese first name by using katakana

472
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,120
yes i confirm

473
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,240
this this is my name in katakana which

474
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,200
to be

475
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,320
matched with one in u.s

476
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,240
for the u.s object

477
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,679
okay most somatic system systems don't

478
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,039
treat them as the same

479
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,000
this page shows graph view analytics

480
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,080
this function is also one of the step

481
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,280
functions

482
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,400
in this page

483
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,720
we can show the six nodes

484
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,440
and some edges

485
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,360
the center circle node means an object

486
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,600
click the node and we can show the

487
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
properties from the bottom detailed

488
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,520
window

489
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,000
we can also japanese value just that i

490
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,200
just

491
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,960
just explained the premier slide

492
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,400
okay this box shows a property does not

493
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,559
include usuke in katakana

494
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,520
okay

495
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,840
ship automatically searches the

496
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,480
correlated sticks from the database and

497
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,480
shows the result table on the left side

498
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,320
a 1 6 is matched

499
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,080
this e means exact matching and

500
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,120
it means

501
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,400
fuzzy matching in this case this is what

502
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,240
one collaboration is matched by

503
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,919
fajimachik

504
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,080
click the checkbox in the cell

505
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,640
graph has appeared and the two graphs

506
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,440
are linked with a green line

507
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,840
this circle node shows

508
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,000
the x-min object person

509
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,840
this value is dictionary value

510
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,000
this box no this box now shows a new

511
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,480
property whose value is usually in

512
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,480
english

513
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,440
this box node shows a property in xjp

514
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,400
natural person this value is katakana

515
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,679
okay

516
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,400
the rubber of this green line is

517
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
fuzzy machine

518
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,760
let's click the green line

519
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,320
okay we can show detail fasimatic

520
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,520
information the first value is use k in

521
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,799
katakana

522
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,559
and the second value is yusuke ryuusuke

523
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,880
in english

524
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,200
in the rural texas area tells us

525
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,159
these values are matched by

526
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,159
case insensitive

527
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,679
and

528
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,360
japanese english matching

529
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,760
in this way ship can overcome the

530
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,240
japanese notation fluctuations

531
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,679
we would like to apply the

532
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,480
implementation to the cases in other

533
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,159
languages and cultures

534
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,880
these six customizers explicit

535
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,520
correlation and fuzzy matching can be

536
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,640
applied not only to the cyber domain

537
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,480
but also to the real world data

538
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,520
the demo is over wrap up

539
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,279
here is a summary

540
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,600
we have implemented the new feature to

541
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,799
match your world data in eschip

542
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,360
the first one is six customizer to

543
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,720
easily create six custom objects

544
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,679
next

545
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,400
explicit correlation and fuzzy matching

546
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,720
to make many chromatic possible for the

547
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,640
award data

548
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,240
i believe

549
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,960
these three features in vital for their

550
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,799
data matching

551
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,360
future work includes

552
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,880
first

553
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,039
we will apply these technologies to

554
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,039
problems from the law enforcement

555
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,080
practitioners and others

556
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,120
second

557
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,919
first service matching is needed because

558
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,760
this matching consumes a lot of time

559
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,720
third

560
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,760
study study and deal with other notation

561
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,919
for exchange of cases

562
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,799
and the last one is enable sharing six

563
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,799
custom objects schemas

564
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,520
and matching rules

565
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,080
takeover message is

566
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,080
easy to create custom objects and

567
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,320
flexible matching mechanism to utilize

568
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,440
durable data like independent islands

569
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,840
along with cyberspace data

570
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,480
if you are interested in the application

571
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,880
ship please join with us

572
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,559
we need more con

573
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,520
contributors please contact the github

574
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,679
account

575
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,760
this is github account

576
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,720
of course it is neither english nor

577
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,559
japanese

578
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,600
this is the end of the talk today but

579
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,480
our journey our journey continues we

580
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,840
will continue our journey to utilize

581
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,440
utilization more good luck with your

582
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,039
next journey

583
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,080
thank you

584
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,320
and thank you from ryusuke ryusuke

585
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,740
as well thank you

586
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:15,440
[Applause]

587
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,000
thank you very much for an interesting

588
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,520
demonstration and talk josie and rio

589
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,919
and i think this can be utilized in many

590
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:24,960
ways and

591
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,679
between many languages when it's

592
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,840
further developed i hope you get good

593
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,039
developers for that good contributions

594
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,600
any questions or comments we have

595
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,080
microphones up here and here please feel

596
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,960
free to yeah

597
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,479
go ahead left first

598
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,440
hi so

599
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,440
thanks for the talk this is indeed an

600
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,080
issue i hadn't thought about it and i

601
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,919
was just wondering if you had talked

602
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,120
with

603
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,320
people at misp to increase and improve

604
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,840
the support of other languages in their

605
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,399
in taxonomies and ontologies and so on

606
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,080
i'll check the misfortunes up

607
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,720
day by day

608
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,679
and uh i i think we will but uh

609
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,640
so

610
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,240
we we have done it in uh sticks and

611
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,279
sticks uh sticks but uh i think this

612
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,880
will be uh also uh possible in mist as

613
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,840
well

614
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,440
so i

615
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,399
kinda

616
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:33,760
we

617
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,440
will discuss this with uh missed people

618
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,320
and

619
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,200
make sure the world is more connected

620
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,039
thank you thanks thank you

621
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,000
um

622
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,640
so for everyone that maintains internal

623
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,320
data sets are there things we can do

624
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
sorry it's like about six inches lower

625
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,320
than i needed

626
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,520
um

627
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,960
are there things we can do for our

628
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,039
internal data sets to set them up to be

629
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,720
able to support

630
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,880
the different rules we find as we expand

631
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,120
out globally so that you know i'm sure

632
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,640
none of us can build like something that

633
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,399
covers everything from the start but are

634
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,919
there things we can do to set ourselves

635
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,279
up for success later as we find the need

636
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,039
to support different regions of the

637
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,279
world and different

638
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,240
structures of data

639
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,000
okay

640
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,200
was it just a comment or

641
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,399
so

642
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,200
like

643
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,240
if we're so if i or someone else here is

644
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,480
maintaining a big data set

645
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,720
and we want to structure our data such

646
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,360
that as we run into these challenges

647
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,640
like the trouble of matching you know

648
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,720
us names to japanese names are there

649
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,559
things we can do initially

650
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,399
that will make those challenges easier

651
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,840
to overcome as we get to them

652
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,039
and so it sounds like

653
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,880
something that you're able to find was

654
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,399
the ability to support

655
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,840
matching

656
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,120
um

657
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,320
was a big enabler of your ability

658
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,120
to then bridge this challenge

659
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,840
um so this is like so if matching were

660
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,240
maybe one of the things that was helpful

661
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,200
to

662
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,720
um

663
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,919
support

664
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,600
um are there other things that we should

665
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,200
think about supporting

666
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,120
so that we can solve these types of

667
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,080
challenges as we get to them

668
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,919
yes so uh

669
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,080
we we have a

670
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,159
kind of uh

671
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,080
future work and

672
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,840
study and deal with

673
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,720
other notation fluctuations and also uh

674
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,480
we are thinking of

675
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,120
structural differences as well

676
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,000
and

677
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,440
make it more as much as possible generic

678
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,320
and also we plan to kind of

679
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,559
enable sharing

680
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,440
object schemas and matching rules as

681
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,399
well so that should

682
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,360
help

683
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,320
it okay

684
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,600
i'm sorry

685
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,360
anyone else

686
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,039
any comments or questions

687
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,000
okay

688
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,399
you can find i'm sure

689
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,159
both

690
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,960
these distinguished speakers satoshi and

691
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,000
rio

692
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,240
in the coffee break which is coming up

693
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,120
next

694
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,600
so thank you very much for attending

695
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,360
this morning thank you

696
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,279
thank you thank you

697
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:34,360
see you in montoya and skoka in japan
