uh and getting up on thursday when

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,200
things are starting to uh

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,280
get a little hectic around here

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,799
um

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,759
so uh so yeah this presentation is uh is

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,759
specifically about the covent task force

33
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,600
that we established at the cyber

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,119
security and infrastructure security

35
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,720
agency where i work

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,799
and and how we work together to support

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,079
the response to the pandemic

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,000
so let's start a little bit with what is

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,520
the cyber security and infrastructure

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,520
security agency

41
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,600
oh and i should say a couple of things

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,079
right up front one if you have a

43
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,520
question at any time during this

44
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,759
presentation go ahead and um

45
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,840
approach the microphones and uh and i'll

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,680
try to acknowledge you and make time for

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,680
your questions that is fine for me to do

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,840
that in line

49
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,119
because i like to i like my

50
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,719
presentations to be as interactive as

51
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,719
possible

52
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,719
the other thing is

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,560
if you know me fairly well

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,799
i despise powerpoint

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,799
but i have lots of graphs and other

56
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,399
things and other data points that we

57
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,440
need to share as part of this

58
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,520
presentation so i was

59
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,160
forced to delve into my uh my nemesis

60
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,480
and generate a presentation not only

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,800
that but i've got 28

62
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,599
slides today for a 35 minute talk so i'm

63
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,599
going to be flying through this at a

64
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,640
clip

65
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,560
and i apologize in advance for that for

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,080
any of you who make

67
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,160
may get lost so again please go ahead

68
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
and ask questions at any time

69
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,800
and uh and it'll be available online so

70
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,720
you can just pause and rewind and try to

71
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,280
catch up if you get lost

72
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,640
um so

73
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,000
sizza as we pronounce it is the uh

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,959
not caesar not syza

75
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,360
is the nation's risk advisor and in

76
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,080
parentheses we also say and reducer

77
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,720
we are not a uh we are not a cyber

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,080
regulator

79
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,200
we um

80
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,959
and we don't have law enforcement

81
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,640
authorities that's why we say we're the

82
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,879
risk advisor for the nation

83
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,720
and when you say risk advisor we mean

84
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,800
all different types of risks not just

85
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,599
cyber um not just cyber security ones so

86
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,280
we have infrastructure security and

87
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,560
emergency communications

88
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,120
responsibilities we also have a national

89
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,200
national risk management center

90
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,800
as you can see we have a couple of other

91
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,200
uh divisions that also work um work with

92
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,519
us to support various functions and we

93
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,280
are the gov cert and the national cert

94
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,000
for the united states

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,599
this is a timeline of the stand-up and

96
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,560
uh

97
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,680
eventual uh handoff of the

98
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,239
sizzikovit task force now

99
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,440
this is going to be a little bit

100
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,959
confusing because i'm sure some of you

101
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,120
probably participating in the sec lounge

102
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,040
capture the flag challenge for the

103
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,840
purposes of this presentation ctf means

104
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,560
the coveted task force so

105
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,480
trying to make sure that's clear

106
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,000
um so the covet task force uh

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,280
was

108
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,040
sort of established as a result of the

109
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,879
coronavirus aid relief and economic

110
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,959
security act that congress passed very

111
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,120
early on in the pandemic

112
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,159
you'll see

113
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,040
this is by the way this graph is the uh

114
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,519
is the coven 19 case graph generated by

115
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,040
the centers for disease control in the

116
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,400
united states

117
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,399
um at the very beginning you see there

118
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,639
in january that is uh patient zero in

119
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,839
the u.s

120
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,040
all the way to the spike after um uh

121
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,720
omicron appeared

122
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,520
and uh and the task force was not

123
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,440
um the task force was sort of like

124
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,360
transition to steady state operations

125
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,880
rather than being a task force in

126
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,000
between

127
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,360
you have um

128
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,040
the establishment of operation warp

129
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,720
speed some of you may have heard of that

130
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,919
was our effort to fast track a vaccine

131
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,759
as quickly as possible

132
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,000
you'll see when mr corman was uh

133
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,600
initially recruited

134
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,160
as a temporary hire to sizza to support

135
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,040
us and when he was able to join us as a

136
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,040
as a as a fellow federal employee

137
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,360
in october of

138
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
what is that making sure i get this

139
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,919
right october of 2020 is when we

140
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,520
released a joint report with our

141
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,800
colleagues at healthcare and human

142
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,000
services and the federal bureau

143
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,080
investigation regarding ransomware

144
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,199
activity targeting health care

145
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,320
and

146
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,520
the generation of the ctf uh

147
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,160
combining both career and cares act

148
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,759
temporary hires

149
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,400
and and one of our publications

150
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,479
the uh the cold chain insight series

151
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,919
which we'll get to in a little bit what

152
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,960
that is you'll see a big gap there

153
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,320
right it looks like we didn't do

154
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,240
anything for a while in the middle i

155
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,759
will assure you that was not the case

156
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,520
we're extremely busy

157
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,680
but i could only fit so much on my

158
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
timeline graphic and the other thing is

159
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,160
there is so much stuff going on in that

160
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,600
range

161
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,639
we're going to spend the rest of the

162
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,639
presentation talking about just some of

163
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,280
it

164
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,759
that we that we supported

165
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,600
so here's the breadth of what we were

166
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,800
dealing with

167
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,240
this goes all the way from the very

168
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,080
beginning of r d where we were mostly

169
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,600
concerned with sort of the intellectual

170
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,199
property of the vaccine companies being

171
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,360
protected from espionage things of that

172
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,280
nature all the way to the end we're

173
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,120
worried about disruptions anywhere in

174
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,280
the supply chain that could lead to you

175
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,520
know even if we had a um even if we had

176
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
a great vaccine candidate was there

177
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,800
anything that could stop it from

178
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,639
actually getting into people's arms and

179
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,720
as you can see there's plenty of

180
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,240
opportunities along the way throughout

181
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,919
that supply chain for a disruption to

182
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,919
happen and we were trying to figure out

183
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,720
okay where can we prioritize our efforts

184
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,160
best to help

185
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,360
so we'll get to that as well

186
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,600
so uh you'll notice up here i say ball

187
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,039
bearings um has anybody studied sort of

188
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,039
uh

189
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,759
has anybody studied history and knows uh

190
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,759
perhaps what the ball bearings reference

191
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,600
might be

192
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,560
okay

193
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,479
got one hand back there

194
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,440
so

195
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,440
world war ii

196
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,960
um

197
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,560
there was an effort you know like where

198
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,960
where should we bomb first

199
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,880
and uh and the idea was well we should

200
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,479
bomb the factories that make the tanks

201
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,840
we should bomb the factories that make

202
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,360
the planes the answer is none of the

203
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,319
above

204
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,919
the answer is bomb the factories that

205
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,440
make the ball bearings because then you

206
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,680
can't make tanks or planes

207
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,479
so

208
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,680
we looked at it from the other

209
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,039
perspective from the defender's

210
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,039
perspective where are our ball bearing

211
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,800
factories in this space

212
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,120
so we know that operation warp speed or

213
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,039
what we called tier zero when we got a

214
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,479
little bit more expanded beyond the

215
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,479
original operation warp speed

216
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,319
um institutions

217
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,360
tier zero was uh all the r d stuff so

218
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,680
that was universities that was um i was

219
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,080
obviously the big uh pfizer and moderna

220
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,160
are vaccine companies

221
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,400
and pharmaceutical companies and uh and

222
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,919
everything that was critical to the mass

223
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,199
manufacture of the vaccine tier one

224
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,560
is what we call the other hundred

225
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,039
organizations that we step back in the

226
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,639
slide you saw the the icon of the

227
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,639
warehouse the icon of the truck the icon

228
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,800
of the cardboard box there were all

229
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,560
kinds of organizations that we also

230
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,759
needed to support to make sure that

231
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,680
supply chain was secure

232
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,360
and then finally

233
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,240
um

234
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,319
and this one's near and dear to my heart

235
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,160
and once again we'll get to that

236
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,720
uh and why but uh healthcare delivery

237
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,639
organizations as we call them which is

238
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,479
hospitals clinics hospital networks um

239
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,080
throughout the country and there are and

240
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,080
in the united states depending on who

241
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,879
you ask and who took the uh the sort of

242
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,280
census of how many healthcare delivery

243
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,639
facilities there are it's somewhere

244
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,879
between five thousand six thousand

245
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,759
usually closer to six thousand at least

246
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,599
um so that's a lot we had a lot of

247
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,320
ground to cover

248
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,760
so

249
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,039
thinking about this ball bearings

250
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,399
metaphor

251
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,039
um

252
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,599
so first we um we were attached you know

253
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,640
like you know like let's make sure

254
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,800
vaccine r d is is squared away right we

255
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,160
want to make sure development is going

256
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,880
to be is going to be safe but where is

257
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,399
the disruption really going to happen

258
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,399
that's going to affect things next and

259
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,320
that's why we started looking at

260
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,560
you know almost immediately as we hit

261
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,000
the ground running as the kova task

262
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
force was formed we started looking at

263
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,600
you know where what is necessary to

264
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,839
scale production of the vaccine where

265
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,640
where can we start to deploy services or

266
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,839
tools or resources or advice or guidance

267
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,279
and make sure that these companies and

268
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,959
institutions are aware of what we can do

269
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,880
to help them reduce their risk

270
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,040
in the scale production area

271
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,519
and finally

272
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,600
focusing on distribution

273
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,959
and this is where we started talking

274
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,120
about what we called the cold chain the

275
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,040
cold chain is everything necessary to

276
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,200
get things from one place to another in

277
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,440
a refrigerated state sometimes a very

278
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,839
extremely cold refrigerated state which

279
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,519
we knew the vaccine once we figured out

280
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,959
that the vaccine candidates were going

281
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,040
to require refrigeration we had to look

282
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,399
at all the different things the

283
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,080
chemicals required

284
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,480
um the types of logistics required and

285
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,839
all sorts of other

286
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,640
aspects of that to make sure that um

287
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,160
make sure that the vaccines would get to

288
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,760
where they needed to be in the condition

289
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,160
that they needed to be in

290
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,680
so

291
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,839
that's how we approach the problem set

292
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,760
this is how we form the team

293
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,279
i'm not going to read you the slide but

294
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,480
i do want to focus on one thing

295
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,920
i mentioned earlier when i was

296
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,519
explaining sizza that we have six

297
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,959
divisions

298
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,200
all focused on supporting different

299
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,680
specialty areas within the mission and

300
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,279
enabling functions

301
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,480
um so we worked with across nearly every

302
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
division within cisa and i shouldn't i

303
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,839
actually probably should have been put

304
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,519
nearly on this slide it was every

305
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,200
division across siza

306
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,000
um

307
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,240
in the end so

308
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,480
and we reported to uh our executive

309
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,880
director who is the most senior ranking

310
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,440
career official in the organization and

311
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,200
that was because uh

312
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,240
um

313
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,920
that was basically because we had we

314
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,760
also had to do this in the middle of a

315
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,320
administration turnover so all kinds of

316
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,640
exciting things happening right

317
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,399
this is an example of the type of stuff

318
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,640
that we were doing in that in that uh in

319
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,480
that big trough that you saw on the

320
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,240
timeline this is one of our analysis

321
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,200
products

322
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,040
um that actually made it into a very

323
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,839
prestigious medical journal

324
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,839
so in february 2021 we hit the

325
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,079
unfortunate milestone of half a million

326
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,920
people dot um paris from covid but 150

327
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,800
000 people perished from other causes

328
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,720
that and that's not to say like

329
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,440
how do i put this correctly excess debts

330
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,519
so the cdc knows pretty much more or

331
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,880
less how many people are going to die in

332
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,279
any given year from various causes right

333
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,440
but if that number is exceeded by a

334
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,800
certain amount then you start to look

335
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,480
into their why are more people dying

336
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,120
than we thought there there would be and

337
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,959
we had they so they have a number called

338
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,800
excess deaths and excess deaths hit 150k

339
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,839
uh 150 000 in february 2021 and we

340
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,200
started looking at you like why is this

341
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,320
happening so we dug into the data the

342
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,680
case data

343
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,519
and again you're like

344
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,360
i thought this was a cyber security talk

345
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,240
no this is an analysis talk

346
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,920
and a risk reduction talk and we're

347
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,680
going to get to cyber aspects in just a

348
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,920
little bit promise just bear with me

349
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,320
so we dug into the data from the cdc and

350
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,079
we used our analytic tool set because

351
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,760
the cares act tires brought us people

352
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,600
from intelligence brought us people from

353
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,120
medical backgrounds brought us people

354
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,639
who really understood all that supply

355
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,680
chain stuff a multi-disciplinary team

356
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,440
and we put that together to work on this

357
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,399
problem

358
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,279
um

359
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,839
we made the we made the the weekly

360
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,680
morbidity and mortality report from the

361
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,279
centers in disease control which is one

362
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,560
of those things where they expect you as

363
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,560
a corresponding author to have a medical

364
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,680
degree and we're like none of us have

365
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,360
medical degrees we just looked at the

366
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,959
data

367
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,880
and determined that definitely there

368
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,079
were

369
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,600
there were excess deaths resulting that

370
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,440
were not expected

371
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,040
and

372
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,880
this is all the stuff that was in this

373
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,240
insight so i'm going to delve a little

374
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,560
bit more into the analysis

375
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,240
you can probably understand this because

376
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,079
it's a network graph

377
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,320
but uh it shows the degradation of

378
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,160
service over time for healthcare

379
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,000
delivery organizations as strain is

380
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,680
applied to the system

381
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,560
so

382
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,519
normal operations in non-pandemic years

383
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,760
is obviously on the left

384
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,360
you add maybe

385
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,720
you know

386
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,560
a couple of overwhelmed hospitals or

387
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,480
clinics

388
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,399
ambulance starts to redirect to

389
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,639
different centers it adds strain to the

390
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,200
system and then maybe maybe one of them

391
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,279
gets hit with ransomware knocks that one

392
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,240
out for for you know however long and

393
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,839
and the system continues to degrade

394
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
and here's the different things people

395
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,920
were dying from these are what people

396
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,440
were perishing of in addition to covin

397
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,040
or excluding covid these are all the

398
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,000
numbers

399
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
uh

400
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,720
the thing you need to know about this

401
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,399
without digging into it too much further

402
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,880
is that these are heart lung and brain

403
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,920
problems

404
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,360
heart lung and brain remember that

405
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,399
because we're getting into it in a

406
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,680
second

407
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,440
and this we want i wanted to show you

408
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,040
because this is who you know

409
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,360
demographically who was perishing in

410
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,680
excess of what was already predicted

411
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,680
um and excluding covet 19 to 2. so what

412
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,320
we look at this we dig into we dig into

413
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,760
the data a little bit more we can see

414
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,800
that um adults in their prime working

415
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,839
years

416
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,600
are perishing of the and these excess

417
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,760
death uh in excess death counts and from

418
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,000
covet as well so it's like what is the

419
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,440
risk to the nation what is the risk to

420
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,959
our essential critical infrastructure

421
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,160
workforce

422
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,279
right that's right there

423
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,279
and um now we're going to get into some

424
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,600
fun cyber stuff we started looking at

425
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
what could happen to our ability to

426
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
administer health care

427
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,519
in case of that ransomware targeting

428
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,199
that we talked about earlier

429
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,560
i want you to take a look at the

430
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,320
southeast half

431
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,639
of this uh of this circle up here that's

432
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,399
your radiology and your imaging your

433
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,760
electronic healthcare records in your

434
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,040
laboratories

435
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,480
if you don't have any of those three

436
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,000
things or you're just missing one of

437
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,760
those things there's tons of stuff you

438
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,680
can't do for people anymore

439
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,399
if you miss ehr you can't give

440
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,760
cancer patients their appropriate

441
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,320
chemotherapy dosages if you miss

442
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,399
laboratories you can't run labs i'd

443
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,839
leave it to you to do the math on what

444
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,160
that that implies and if you do if you

445
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,800
don't have radiology you can't treat um

446
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,399
stroke patients because you don't have

447
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,639
imaging to find out where the uh

448
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,360
where where the problem is

449
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,720
and here

450
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,880
so this says conceptual

451
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,320
but this is based on a real live

452
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,519
incident

453
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,440
and it take and as you can see it took

454
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,519
almost it took basically six months to

455
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,920
get back on fully online for all

456
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,839
services to be restored

457
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,199
um

458
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,680
so that's a really long time

459
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,320
for for a hospital to be to be unable to

460
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,079
deliver care and we know this based on

461
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,040
real events that happen

462
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,920
and again a conceptual model

463
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,360
but

464
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,120
there's a there's

465
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,199
real analysis to back this up based on

466
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,680
real world things and we basically did

467
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,759
connect the dots exercise

468
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,440
so

469
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,360
you have a ransomware attack or some

470
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,800
other disruptive type of cyber event

471
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,959
drops the drops the network drops your

472
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,880
ability to access services

473
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,720
you start to divert ambulances because

474
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
you can't provide services now

475
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,600
you divert those ambulances five minutes

476
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,519
people with um people with certain

477
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,759
conditions like brain heart and lung can

478
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,600
be uh negatively impacted by that you

479
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,920
start to divert it by 15 minutes again

480
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,759
brain heart and lung you there's a

481
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,519
golden hour for these types of things

482
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,639
you know

483
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,600
and

484
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,759
once you start to divert like 90 minutes

485
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,279
out

486
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,959
from where the patient is and here's

487
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,160
here's where we found the original

488
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,639
analysis of this was about marathons and

489
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,720
their impact on patient outcomes

490
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,480
marathons cause ambulances to be

491
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,720
diverted because huge you know stretches

492
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,320
of city streets

493
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,240
will be blocked off and ambulances will

494
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,720
need to divert around the marathon route

495
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,160
or route um and uh

496
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,759
and once they arrive they're going to be

497
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,040
a little bit later than they normally

498
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
would be so people took this data did

499
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,880
the analysis and said okay this is going

500
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,880
to have this has a negative impact on

501
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,399
patient outcomes

502
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,959
and so we took that analysis and we did

503
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,800
we did the connect connect the dots

504
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,360
exercise and we basically determined you

505
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,880
combine that with the hospital strain

506
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,920
we're already dealing with in the

507
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,600
pandemic

508
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,520
add a ransomware attack to that and

509
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,079
you're going to have um an increase in

510
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,760
delays to service

511
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,839
and delays to service

512
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,359
cause uh

513
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,160
cause

514
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,000
increased numbers of deaths

515
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,439
so we're like this is what we're dealing

516
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,880
with this is the problem we're trying to

517
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,760
tackle

518
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,319
so now how did we start to um

519
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,839
how do we start to address all of this

520
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,760
we know there's 6 000 hospitals we can't

521
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,359
do one-on-one outreach with every single

522
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,720
one of them we know there are these

523
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,320
hundreds of organizations that may or

524
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,600
may not know that they are part of a

525
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
critical supply chain and that we have

526
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,360
resources that can help them

527
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,280
um and what we kind of determined about

528
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,039
a lot of the organizations that we were

529
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,039
that we were trying to assist is that we

530
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,720
considered the environment to be target

531
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,600
rich

532
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,280
we also considered the environment to be

533
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,160
mostly cyber poor a lot of immature

534
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,000
programs at these organizations how can

535
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
we help them

536
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,600
so we started developing things like

537
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,760
this the bad practices

538
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,799
i strongly encourage all of you to uh

539
00:17:58,799 --> 00:17:59,919
instead of trying to read this

540
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,000
screenshot go ahead and just like google

541
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,640
or use your favorite search engine um

542
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,280
and uh and hit up sizza.gov and search

543
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,039
for bad practices or just type says or

544
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,039
bad practices it should pop up is one of

545
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,320
the first hits there's only three of

546
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,640
these it's really simple everybody knows

547
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,080
best practices and there's hundreds of

548
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,400
those bad practices we made sure it was

549
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
a very very short list and they're

550
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,480
really simple don't use end of life or

551
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,160
unsupported software

552
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,520
don't use

553
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,000
single factor authentication for uh for

554
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,640
administrative or remote access and

555
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,400
don't use weak fixed or default

556
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,760
passwords

557
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,840
and don't for critical infrastructure

558
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,000
specifically so we made this as a way to

559
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,440
get people like you know in the right

560
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,280
mindset of you know like if you're doing

561
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,120
these things you are low hanging fruit

562
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,720
for the adversary

563
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,559
bad guys love when people do these

564
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,160
things so please stop doing them or

565
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,080
figure out a way to get out of that

566
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,600
practice

567
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,919
we created stuff off search

568
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,520
now

569
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,039
i will say uh leave it to your

570
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,039
imagination what the original name of

571
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,640
this was when it was a little bit less

572
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,679
polite

573
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,200
um but uh stuff off search was uh

574
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,120
everybody's familiar with showdan and

575
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,000
census and thankful

576
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,600
more or less

577
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,760
um so yeah we basically created a

578
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,360
do-it-yourself guide to getting your

579
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,919
stuff off of those search engines so you

580
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,840
can manage your attack surface better

581
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,600
because once again what do we know about

582
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,520
the bad guys they love

583
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,120
finding stuff on these things and they

584
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,480
use these they use these tools as well

585
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,400
and we um we also have our known

586
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,320
exploited vulnerabilities catalog who is

587
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,200
already familiar with this

588
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,760
awesome okay seen a lot of hands so this

589
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,000
is our list of all of not just the cves

590
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
that are you know the cdes that are most

591
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,720
severe or highest scored or any of that

592
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,120
but the cves that we know adversaries

593
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,440
are using against targets

594
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
that we have observed in the wild being

595
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,360
employed

596
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,559
and so this is the the shortest possible

597
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,880
list of every must-patch vulnerability

598
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,039
in your environment once again to try to

599
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,000
help these

600
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,240
um these organizations with less mature

601
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
less well-resourced

602
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,799
programs to prioritize those scarce

603
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,039
resources better

604
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,440
and we created a webinar this is another

605
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,360
thing i do encourage you to uh to take a

606
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,799
look at

607
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,960
you'll get to see my my colleague josh

608
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,799
corman introducing the pragmatic cyber

609
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,039
security webinar and you also see some

610
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,360
of our colleagues from the karazak staff

611
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,039
who were part of the kova task force

612
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,640
that i got to work with

613
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,000
um

614
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,840
and um anyway we talk about our the bad

615
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,720
practices we talk about the um

616
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,159
stuff off search

617
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,679
and then we talk about our tabletop

618
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,240
exercise packages so sizza has a long

619
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,159
list of tabletop exercise packages for

620
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,400
any type of organization to like use at

621
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,960
their leisure and we're trying being

622
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,960
we've been trying to encourage more and

623
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,640
more organizations say like hey if

624
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,840
you're starting your program or you

625
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,080
don't have an exercise program yet go

626
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,679
ahead and download some of these and

627
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,360
start using them especially like for

628
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,559
example the ransomware module

629
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,360
um

630
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,559
so

631
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,880
let's delve in a little bit more deeply

632
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,799
into what we did for each of these

633
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,159
tranches of uh or categories of

634
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,640
of organizations that we were helping

635
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,159
for tier 0

636
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,480
that's smallest for the smallest number

637
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,320
of institutions that we were trying to

638
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,240
look after we were able to do some of

639
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,080
the things that don't scale very well so

640
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,600
we did our full red team assessment

641
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,400
services for them we provided our cyber

642
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
hygiene assessments which i'll i'll

643
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,520
probably describe a little bit more

644
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,600
or you can just come ask me later about

645
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,039
the cyber hygiene services that we

646
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,400
provide

647
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
we did some special enhanced information

648
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,000
sharing especially with our partner

649
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,400
agencies

650
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,840
to make sure that these folks had the

651
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,840
best threat intelligence and other other

652
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,600
information that they could use and we

653
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,799
did a program called cyber sentry and we

654
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,880
applied what we call persistent threat

655
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,919
hunting

656
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,840
so persistent threat hunting is uh

657
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,440
continuous right

658
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,880
most people are familiar with the idea

659
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,799
of a hunt engagement you go in you look

660
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,799
around and then uh and then you take

661
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,880
your taps and you go leave and go look

662
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,400
around somewhere else this was

663
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,320
persistent threat hunting one of the

664
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,760
most

665
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,000
unscalable things we do it's extremely

666
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
resource intensive but we made sure to

667
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,640
do it for the tier zero family of uh

668
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,720
family of institutions

669
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,559
tier one right this is the one that was

670
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,640
about a hundred organizations so we

671
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,400
obviously couldn't scale all of our

672
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,480
services to this but we did do

673
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,320
one-on-one outreach and i got to tell

674
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,200
you

675
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,000
um

676
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,799
i'm not a salesperson but i did uh i did

677
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,200
a big chunk of uh i did a big chunk of

678
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,440
these companies because i had i got the

679
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,360
the california region and a few other

680
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,200
west coast were assigned to me

681
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,679
and um man that was

682
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,520
i was extremely thankful every time a

683
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,120
lead turned into somebody who actually

684
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,720
wanted to talk to us about services and

685
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,600
resources i'll just put it that way

686
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,280
it's a

687
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,000
it's um not fun necessarily cold calling

688
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,600
people who don't know what your agency

689
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,760
does or what your agency's mission is

690
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,440
and saying like no no no free stuff from

691
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,720
the government i'm from the government

692
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,280
i'm here to help

693
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,120
not everybody is completely receptive to

694
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,480
that but we were able to get some

695
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,799
penetration we did get um good leads we

696
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,640
got to the right people and we made we

697
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,919
made a difference

698
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,360
and these are the services i'm not going

699
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,799
to read all of these to you you can

700
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,039
search for them and uh and check them

701
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,280
out at your leisure

702
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,960
and hdos

703
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,240
and this one

704
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,520
you know we couldn't do one-on-one

705
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,720
outreach so we're like how are we going

706
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,720
to start like trying to target this

707
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,120
entire community the answer was we hit

708
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,280
the national level associations and

709
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,600
communities there so there are things in

710
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,120
um i think there's some global

711
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,480
organizations like healthcare

712
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,840
information management uh system society

713
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,840
there's some us-based domestic

714
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,919
organizations like the joint commission

715
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,840
we reached out to those

716
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,679
those in turn gave us opportunities to

717
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,760
do webinars targeting different parts of

718
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,799
the uh

719
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,880
parts of the healthcare ecosystem and

720
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,240
that's how we made sure that they were

721
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,840
aware of all these different resources

722
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,080
that we have available and you know and

723
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,720
share and share those with those uh

724
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,039
with those entities and this is ongoing

725
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,039
continuous this will probably never end

726
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,240
because

727
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,760
all the way back to that thing about

728
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,440
ransomware and ambulance diversion and

729
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,919
how it can lead to excess deaths or

730
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,080
contribute to greater than normal excess

731
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,480
deaths

732
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,400
that's not going away

733
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,240
we've we've determined that conclusion

734
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,600
because of data that we were able to

735
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,200
analyze and

736
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,480
analysis we were able to conduct

737
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,559
during the pandemic but even when this

738
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,559
pandemic is finally over

739
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,840
or you know

740
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,720
at least in some more steady state

741
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,200
uh even when that's all over with this

742
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,640
is going to be a continuous issue

743
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,840
um just a little bit about some of the

744
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,080
cross-sector analysis we were able to do

745
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,159
i discussed the cold chain discovery

746
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,799
like we learned so much about the the

747
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,559
cold storage supply chain and cold

748
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,799
logistics

749
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,720
that analysis on hospital functions and

750
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,520
effects on services was a was a is going

751
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,279
to be uh paying dividends for a long

752
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,400
time i hope

753
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,960
um we learned more about strains on what

754
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,480
cesar calls the national critical

755
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,720
functions we learned more about strains

756
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,200
on second or sorry the cascading effects

757
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,039
on critical infrastructure sectors

758
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,880
especially as that essential critical

759
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,559
infrastructure worker

760
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,679
uh

761
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,840
force was depleted

762
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,440
due to illness or

763
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,400
other excess death problems etc etc etc

764
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
there were supply chain disruptions i

765
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,159
think everybody experienced that to one

766
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,679
degree or another

767
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,919
um we learned about how those supply

768
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,480
chain disruptions were impacting other

769
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,120
things and also like i said the risk to

770
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,679
the the eciw as we called it that

771
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,320
workforce

772
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,400
here's what worked and here's the

773
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,679
lessons learned for everything

774
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,440
collaboration across the divisions

775
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
between cyber national risk management

776
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,919
stakeholder engagement the integrated

777
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,520
operations division

778
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,559
um

779
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,240
all of the different divisions working

780
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,320
together the collaboration was enabled

781
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,760
by that

782
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,960
by that task force and the

783
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,880
prioritization of the work

784
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,760
um a crisis is a great time for pilots

785
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,600
you know it's like have we tried this

786
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,240
before no well it's pretty important so

787
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,559
let's try this now right this is a great

788
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,360
time to take risks and do things or

789
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,360
you know sort of like take some

790
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,919
adventure adventurous thinking and use

791
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,440
your imagination

792
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,520
uh and we were able to do that as well

793
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,880
we did some things that otherwise

794
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,919
wouldn't be uh wouldn't probably be a

795
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,760
standard operating procedure let me just

796
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,039
put it that way

797
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,640
um

798
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,400
you know we got we started this whole

799
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,320
outreach to national level associations

800
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,919
for healthcare delivery organizations

801
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,919
because of this pandemic right and

802
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,840
that's that ongoing continuous work and

803
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,120
that's going to be

804
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,840
a great benefit to our country and

805
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,200
society and international sharing was

806
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,960
also we had some international partners

807
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,240
who were kind of leading us with the

808
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,760
data so we would see what was happening

809
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,679
in another country and be like oh is

810
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,840
that about to happen over here we also

811
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,279
had to go the other way where some

812
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,279
things happened in the united states we

813
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,400
shared the same data with our

814
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,679
international partners and they were

815
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,279
able to determine that they were about

816
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,360
to you know face the same risk and that

817
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,840
they need to prepare to tackle

818
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,880
um

819
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,880
and uh these are the things the things

820
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,640
that need work most people still don't

821
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,880
know what a scissor is or what it does

822
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,039
uh we have you know we are relatively

823
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,120
young agency um

824
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,720
we have to constantly explain ourselves

825
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,559
like hey remember u.s cert and i see us

826
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,320
sir yes sizza now

827
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,159
um still doing all the same stuff and

828
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,679
then more um right-sizing the service

829
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,840
catalog right we had all these different

830
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,399
um sort of categories and populations

831
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,840
that we're trying to reach to and

832
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,240
deliver what the you know what was the

833
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,279
best fit for purpose for their needs

834
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,720
we learned a lot about our service

835
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,279
catalog not necessarily being like

836
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,120
the best thing ever and that we needed

837
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,880
to uh

838
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,399
make sure to tune it up for the

839
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,679
audiences we were trying to serve

840
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,360
build more capacity for incident

841
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,039
response and support

842
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,120
uh i think that does what it says on the

843
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,159
label

844
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,600
and uh when i say administrative experts

845
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,000
the people that can um

846
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,520
the people that make all the other gears

847
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,399
turn right we had lots of these uh

848
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,159
extremely clever people with all sorts

849
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,880
of great um backgrounds and experience

850
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,880
but what we uh what we really needed

851
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,200
most sometimes were people that just

852
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,919
knew how to navigate the bureaucracy to

853
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,240
get things done and keep the rest of us

854
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,520
on track

855
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,520
so it's not just you know to have really

856
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,200
thoughtful intelligent people with a you

857
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,960
know powerful education and lots of

858
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,440
experience isn't necessarily the be all

859
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,039
end-all you also need people who just

860
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,120
know how to make things work

861
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,559
and uh

862
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,159
and muscle memory

863
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,679
is something that's really important to

864
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,279
me because as part of the covet task

865
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,240
force

866
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,159
uh what we determined was we need to

867
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,840
remember how to do this for future task

868
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,679
forces how are we going to keep these

869
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,440
trust connections in place between all

870
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,200
the different divisions between these

871
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,760
multiple multiple

872
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,360
multi-disciplinary teams and with our

873
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,720
partners like at healthcare and human

874
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,960
services

875
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,159
all right

876
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,919
question i noticed nobody walked up to

877
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,279
the microphone so that means i must have

878
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,480
done an outstanding job

879
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,039
yes sir

880
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,559
it was that was great just a quick

881
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,480
question on when it came to your cold

882
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,760
calling and outreach um what did

883
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,760
how did you do lead gen for such a

884
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,840
diverse kind of group of stakeholders

885
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,679
and what did the ideal candidate for

886
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,679
conversion look like like who had the

887
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,159
resources to uptake your offer of help

888
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,080
because presumably there was some work

889
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,120
required on there and um

890
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,720
so

891
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,399
lead generation was uh social media

892
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,679
linkedin

893
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:48,559
uh

894
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,960
know a gal who knows a gal kind of thing

895
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,480
um

896
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,279
so there was like we used basically like

897
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,440
we had a multi-disciplinary approach no

898
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,520
we uh we used every tool at our disposal

899
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,200
to do lead generation and try to find

900
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,679
people in the sizzo shop or the uh the

901
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,279
you know the it team

902
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,360
or sometimes in the case depending on

903
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,399
the size of the business we'd go

904
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,240
straight to the ceo

905
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,720
um and if we did get the ceo we tried to

906
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,000
make sure that they were talking to an

907
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,840
equivalent level within our organization

908
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,760
obviously we don't want you know like

909
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,760
little old me talking to the ceo or

910
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,279
founding father of a company or

911
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,760
something like that

912
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,440
and uh

913
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,960
ideal candidate is a tricky question

914
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,880
honestly we were looking for anybody

915
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,240
that would listen

916
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,840
and then we would try to tune the

917
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,520
services to meet them so when i talk

918
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,279
about our cyber hygiene services for

919
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,240
example there are four of those

920
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,919
uh three or four services that we can

921
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,799
provide at scale to almost anybody what

922
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,720
we do is start them with simple attack

923
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,480
surface management stuff like

924
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,399
vulnerability scanning and get them to

925
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,559
you know like hey give us an ip range we

926
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,399
can help you start your asset management

927
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,760
program by at least telling you what's

928
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,320
on your perimeter and where the cves are

929
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,919
and we'll tell you which of those cves

930
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,440
are on the non-exploited vulnerabilities

931
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,120
catalog and then

932
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,720
if you uh

933
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,240
if you turn out to be able to take that

934
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,480
information and act on it because again

935
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,240
like week by week we can see who's

936
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,519
patching what

937
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,880
um or at least mitigating um

938
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,880
and we say like hey are you interested

939
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,480
in web application scanning are you

940
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,159
listening interested in a phishing

941
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,519
assessment things of that nature

942
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,880
and that's kind of standard operating

943
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,559
procedure that wasn't even necessarily

944
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,600
special for this effort

945
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,640
in the back yes sir good morning tom

946
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,039
thanks for the presentation

947
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,159
as you know i'm in the healthcare so one

948
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,679
of the things that

949
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,120
we find is that

950
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,760
trying to do and not allow end of life

951
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,480
for mri scanners cat scanners when

952
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,240
they're first of all a lot of these

953
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,000
doctors don't even know that there's a

954
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,720
computer in these things

955
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,320
and these things cost two three maybe

956
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,399
four million dollars

957
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,679
if i'm a small hospital or or even a big

958
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,840
government research organization i'm not

959
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,960
taking that money on my operating budget

960
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,799
to fix them

961
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,919
just so

962
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,799
and not be able to do my mission so what

963
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,640
i would love for you to do

964
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,240
just to do is help us figure out ways to

965
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
mitigate these issues without putting

966
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,880
behind the vlan where people can't

967
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,640
access them because most of these

968
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,720
organizations need to

969
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,799
monitor them remotely because they're

970
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,360
not going to be sending

971
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,519
people technicians to all these

972
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,679
different hospitals

973
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:38,960
um

974
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,279
yes

975
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,120
i mean that's so i really love this

976
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,880
quest i really love um

977
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,799
the uh because this is the difficult

978
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,440
conversation that we need to have right

979
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,080
um cizza needs to have that with the

980
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,320
community as well about like how do we

981
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
deal with end of life in in healthcare

982
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,840
for especially the types of systems

983
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,840
you're talking about the the stuff where

984
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,919
rip and replace is not an option at all

985
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,440
it's off the table

986
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,840
the vlan is not a great option either

987
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,760
and so what do we do to mitigate the

988
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,120
risk

989
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,720
given all of that and that's why you

990
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,159
know like the uh

991
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,640
to draw the line in the sand so to speak

992
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,320
about end of life and call that a bad

993
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,159
practice and make it number one was

994
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,159
specifically so that we can have start

995
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,559
the hard conversation about what do we

996
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,279
do to mitigate that risk when you know

997
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,760
the most straightforward options aren't

998
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,279
on the table aren't on the table

999
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,440
initially so do you want you know can we

1000
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,200
talk about that offline some more and

1001
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,360
maybe start some correspondence as well

1002
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,600
just contact me and we need to get all

1003
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,000
of nih involved because we're all

1004
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,880
feeling the same issues and we can help

1005
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,240
you with the

1006
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,519
hospitals

1007
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,720
and at least because we have the

1008
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,320
experience

1009
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,000
great thank you very much i look forward

1010
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,159
to it

1011
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,320
um thank you for your presentation it

1012
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,240
seems like a tremendous effort it was

1013
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,200
very interesting i had one question

1014
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,279
i was really interested by this whole

1015
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,799
cold chain

1016
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,000
action but i was wondering what uh

1017
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,359
measures you took

1018
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,119
for the supply chain of that tier zero

1019
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,040
um

1020
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,918
the tier like

1021
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,399
can you re can you maybe rephrase that

1022
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,839
i'm not completely sure i understand the

1023
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,280
question my understanding is the tier

1024
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,320
zeros the big producers of the vaccine

1025
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,119
right uh and i'm sure they have a bunch

1026
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,918
of relationships with other companies or

1027
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,040
uh suppliers and i was wondering what

1028
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,639
how you looked into that

1029
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,440
yes um you like how did we analyze what

1030
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,918
those supply chains were yeah that's

1031
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,599
where the multidisciplinary approach

1032
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,480
really um really helped out initially

1033
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,719
was by getting the right people on the

1034
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,599
team

1035
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,320
um like who people who had run hospital

1036
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,239
networks before for example was one of

1037
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,560
them people who were um from healthcare

1038
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,079
and human services had a background

1039
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,720
there and knew like how

1040
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,880
you know various

1041
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,839
you know

1042
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,240
pharmaceutical uh pharmaceutical grade

1043
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,920
things are produced and how they get to

1044
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,920
the pfizers and moderners of the world

1045
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,560
etc or to academic institutions doing r

1046
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,480
d they were the ones instrumental in

1047
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,560
helping us identify like boom boom boom

1048
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,320
boom boom this is what tier zero needs

1049
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,680
to consist of

1050
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,520
and then we and then spreading that out

1051
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,400
to uh to tier one thanks

1052
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,079
do we have time for one more

1053
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:26,800
one

1054
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
oh great because i got two

1055
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,119
very quick thanks tom great great stuff

1056
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,040
i'm glad to see my tax dollars at work

1057
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,280
and it'd be great to advertise all the

1058
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,240
good stuff

1059
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,000
so the the rest of the taxpayers in the

1060
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,480
country would know that um two things

1061
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,839
one on the

1062
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,079
persistent threat hunting just curious

1063
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,119
if that was

1064
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,119
um you know what kind of results you got

1065
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,200
from that without getting into details

1066
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,960
and the other question is on the

1067
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,160
the study

1068
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,839
uh showing the excess deaths and the

1069
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,400
contributions that a ransomware attack

1070
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,280
would make are you aware of or are you

1071
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,680
aware of people thinking about using

1072
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,000
that in prosecutions when you have

1073
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,240
attribution somebody who's

1074
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,800
actually put in jail

1075
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,839
and using as an enhancement for example

1076
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,480
and you know you yes you did ransomware

1077
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,079
but you also probably killed this many

1078
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,560
people while you did it thanks

1079
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,640
um

1080
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,720
these are short questions because no i

1081
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,400
can't talk too much about what we found

1082
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,760
with persistent threat hunting i

1083
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,960
apologize

1084
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,920
um

1085
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,359
but uh

1086
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,680
the other one is also no i am not aware

1087
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,040
of anybody

1088
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,040
using that analysis to support a

1089
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,640
ransomware prosecution but that does

1090
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,000
certainly sound interesting

1091
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,960
all right

1092
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,359
thank you very much um i forgot to

1093
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,720
remind you at the beginning of this

1094
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,640
session that this session is top white

1095
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,160
so you can say whatever you want about

1096
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,400
this on social media etc

1097
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,200
um but uh please thank the speaker for

1098

this wonderful

1099
