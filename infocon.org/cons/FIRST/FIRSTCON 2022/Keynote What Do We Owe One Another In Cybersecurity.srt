2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,760
good morning everybody

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,920
welcome to the second day here in dublin

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,640
i'm glad to see the is kind of full this

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,359
auditorium was designed for 2000 people

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,840
me nearly a thousand so

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,519
it kind of looks harmful that's good

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,920
i take it the first day was very well

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,840
received at least the feedback i got was

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,599
very well received

11
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,440
i hear people were

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,440
are excited about meeting in person

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,520
again and i must say that same is true

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,879
for me i'm

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,120
really happy to

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,680
kind of see people in person again it

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,079
started feeling like a strange dream

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,239
where you see people in skirt boxes

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,920
maybe and uh

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,600
so really happy to hear

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,360
i'm also told that people really

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,680
appreciated the training session

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,600
yesterday that

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,760
macon roman gave

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,680
this is really cool and there is

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,280
something i'd like to ask you if you

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,799
enjoy trainings

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,439
and if you enjoy giving trainings

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,760
speak out to us we are really looking

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,320
for people that volunteer giving

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,920
training sessions giving training

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,439
courses on something you're passionate

33
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,720
about

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,479
first we'll support you with this we

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,759
will

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,479
reimburse you with all the expenses

37
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,759
if this is something you would be

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,040
interested

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,880
even if you have never done it talk to

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,040
us we'll try to support you send an

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,520
email to either firstsec at first.org or

42
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,119
talk to me or any of the other board

43
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,119
members

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,799
now there's one thing i've been told to

45
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,840
make a

46
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,759
for public announcement and if you look

47
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,840
at these notebooks and you look at the

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,000
last page and i've never seen this

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,720
personally it says ingredients pine nuts

50
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,320
so depending on where you fly you

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,479
actually have to tick the box i bring

52
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,759
food in

53
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,000
because the booklet contains

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,640
pine seeds

55
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:04,960
and

56
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,479
i guess if you want to avoid a

57
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,560
conversation within

58
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,480
overly dutiful customs or border guard

59
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,239
then maybe you take this if it's

60
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,720
appropriate

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
other than that there's a really not

62
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,599
much for me to say except to welcome

63
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,640
ganesh one of our platinum sponsors

64
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,760
and

65
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,000
maybe let me thank all the sponsors

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,400
again because thanks to people like

67
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,519
ganesh and optics we can actually make

68
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,680
this conference happening so without

69
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,239
further ado

70
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,560
optics is the tool of choice for modern

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,959
defenders offering advanced detection of

72
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,720
attacks and helping create a strong

73
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,360
defensive posture to neutralize them

74
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,200
the platform gathers high fidelity

75
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,879
signals from an array of telemetry

76
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,480
sources across your entire attack

77
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,040
surface including all endpoints cloud

78
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,840
workloads and cloud infrastructure

79
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,760
with a powerful streaming analytics

80
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,159
engine and data pipeline you gain access

81
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,239
to a wealth of structured security data

82
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,760
in real time

83
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,000
data summarizations and visualizations

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,400
offer easy to understand insights and

85
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,120
measurable security performance metrics

86
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,080
plus with no black box detections easily

87
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,920
find the answers you need for detections

88
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,159
and remediation investigations

89
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,400
compliance and more

90
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,959
uptix helps modern defenders speed time

91
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,640
to detection conduct better

92
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,400
investigations and deliver better

93
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
security outcomes which can translate

94
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
into better roi from your security

95
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,360
program

96
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,280
sign up for your live demo now and see

97
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,239
upticks in action

98
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,480
hi everyone i'm ganesh pai

99
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,519
i'm founder and ceo of optics

100
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,760
my background i'm an engineer by

101
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,799
training a technologist by

102
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,439
vocation and entrepreneur by choice but

103
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,680
more importantly i love incident

104
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,159
response and i love the organization

105
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,519
and many of you out here uh inspired me

106
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,159
in more ways than one

107
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,280
uh first no pun intended i appreciate

108
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,519
the opportunity presented to us by the

109
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,280
first organization

110
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,200
to participate here in dublin

111
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,358
we've been participating uh arguably for

112
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,959
the last

113
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,160
five years

114
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,960
possibly we could out of the six years

115
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,520
of existence of upticks

116
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,440
2018 in malaysia 2019 in edinburgh and

117
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,320
now hopefully in a significant way in

118
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,919
dublin

119
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,240
the ethos of this organization

120
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,960
and especially that of incident

121
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,720
responders and what you stand for is

122
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,120
very near and dear to optics

123
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,199
so go first

124
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,680
a little bit about optics

125
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,360
before i get started

126
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,520
as exciting as the video might have been

127
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,800
i'd like to

128
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,280
share something and outline

129
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,520
here's the jersey which our team has put

130
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,720
together this is a limited edition

131
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,120
first jersey there are only two out of

132
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,800
this of course there are a lot more

133
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
soccer jerseys available

134
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,000
at our booth feel free to stop by and

135
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,639
say hi and we'd be happy to hook you up

136
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,960
but the reason i picked this specific

137
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,520
one is that this is one out of two and

138
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,759
you might appreciate it given the fact

139
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,000
that we've not had an opportunity to

140
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,840
meet for the last two years thanks to

141
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,320
covet

142
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,840
a little bit about us we are a

143
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,600
boston-based cybersecurity venture

144
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,880
we provide

145
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,520
coverage for two asset categories

146
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,919
endpoint detection and response and the

147
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,520
second one is cloud infrastructure

148
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,120
security

149
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,000
yes if gartner has a acronym soup which

150
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,800
begins with the alphabet c for cloud

151
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,639
optics provides something meaningful for

152
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,919
that

153
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,319
more importantly as a venture what we

154
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,120
specialize is in an area where software

155
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,199
is eating the world

156
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,520
we provide visibility in the software's

157
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,000
journey all the way from the laptop to

158
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,479
the cloud

159
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,960
next to the reason why are we here and

160
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,400
why we're participating in this

161
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,479
conference

162
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,720
we strongly feel about our mission to

163
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,560
empower the human intelligence

164
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,880
especially to the people who are

165
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,039
attending this conference especially the

166
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,639
analysts who are responsible for

167
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,240
detection and incident response

168
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
what differentiates us

169
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,360
is our ability to unearth what lies

170
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,720
beneath

171
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,960
most vendors probably including us are

172
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,800
quite adept at detections but what

173
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
specializes the people who attend this

174
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,919
conference

175
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,919
is your skill which allows you to do

176
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,400
threat hunting and figure out things

177
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,199
using human intelligence

178
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,840
we of course provide you the tooling to

179
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
reduce your dwell time

180
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,840
but one thing that i'll also bring up is

181
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,400
that as many of you probably speak good

182
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,120
english we speak yara as fluently as

183
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,080
that so given that the majority of you

184
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,479
might be involved in threat hunting we

185
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,199
operationalize threat hunting at scale

186
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,120
especially using the yara language

187
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,599
please visit us at our booth so that we

188
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,240
can share our customer anecdotes give us

189
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,440
perspective on what our engagement with

190
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,840
organizations and users like yourself

191
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,160
has been

192
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,160
without further ado

193
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,560
next i'd like to introduce the keynote

194
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,720
speaker my job is to just introduce the

195
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
next person whom i'm sure you're all

196
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,240
waiting for

197
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,800
she's an accomplished industry analyst

198
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,120
and a security practitioner

199
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,890
please welcome wendy nather

200
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:51,520
[Applause]

201
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,759
hello everyone

202
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,080
good morning it's vodka time did anybody

203
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,759
tell you that

204
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,400
who's with me

205
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,479
all right

206
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,479
given what's happened over the last few

207
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,639
years and how we've discovered we've had

208
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,800
a forced lesson in how to come together

209
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,680
as

210
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,120
as a planet

211
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,440
not just as a society

212
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,440
i thought it would be time to take a

213
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,319
step

214
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,000
forward and ask what we owe one another

215
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,840
in the cybersecurity ecosystem

216
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,639
not just what we can do because we've

217
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,399
been talking about

218
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,719
that for a long long time

219
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,360
not what would be nice but what do we

220
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,479
owe one another i think kumbaya time is

221
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,440
over

222
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,080
i think it's time for us to step forward

223
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,920
as responsible

224
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,120
adults and talk about what we actually

225
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,600
owe one another

226
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,320
because today businesses are computing

227
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,440
as ecosystems they're no longer

228
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,080
just little silos or as i like to call

229
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,640
them cylinders of excellence

230
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,160
they are

231
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,120
they are

232
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,720
cooperating with each other they're

233
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,839
competing with each other

234
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,200
organizations have thousands of partners

235
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
some of them actually competitors at the

236
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,080
same time some people are competitors

237
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,839
are using the same suppliers the same

238
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,839
providers so we are all one vast

239
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,200
ecosystem we're not a supply chain does

240
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,040
not end at a terminal point as my

241
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,000
colleague helen patton likes to say

242
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,600
it is a web

243
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,680
and we are all somewhere in the middle

244
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,240
the other thing is remember that great

245
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,680
joke about uh the the two hikers and the

246
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,519
bear coming in one of them says oh i

247
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,440
don't have to outrun the bear i just

248
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,680
have to outrun you

249
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,080
well the problem with that joke today is

250
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,519
there's more than enough bear to go

251
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,120
around

252
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,480
with automation and wide scale attacks

253
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,320
you do not need to be faster than

254
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,200
anybody else to escape being attacked

255
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,600
you will be attacked anyway

256
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
the question is who wants to target you

257
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,160
in particular who's opportunistic are

258
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,880
you going to be caught up in a large

259
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,320
wave of harvesting

260
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,800
we are operating on some very outdated

261
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,519
models that it is a zero-sum game and

262
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,279
that if you win

263
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,279
and and make sure everybody else loses

264
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,279
then you're not going to be attacked

265
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,600
that's ridiculous we can't operate like

266
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,800
that anymore we can't operate as every

267
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,760
organization for itself

268
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,839
because of breaches affect more than

269
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,200
just the large organization

270
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,399
this uh this is a great report series

271
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,240
from uh scientia and risk recon um

272
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,640
which is um

273
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,000
a an organization from mastercard the

274
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,959
ripples across the risk surface the

275
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,399
the actual

276
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,720
ripple effects of breaches

277
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,160
that were studied

278
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,240
uh and one one

279
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,399
example that really

280
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,120
got to me was the blackbaud

281
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,040
breach the ransom

282
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,120
the blackbaud ransomware incident who

283
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,600
had heard of blackbaud before this

284
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,519
happened

285
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,920
like one person had heard a blackbaud

286
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,800
before

287
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,120
as of last count they're still studying

288
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,880
and tallying up the ripple effects of

289
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
that breach but over a thousand

290
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,200
organizations were affected

291
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,000
and that included a lot of non-profits

292
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,200
because blackbaud is a platform for

293
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,120
non-profits

294
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
non-profits are the other critical

295
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,279
infrastructure

296
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,680
when non-profits go down

297
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,760
people don't get fed there's no

298
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,399
emergency response people go go unhoused

299
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,720
everything that you can think of

300
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,880
they go without medical care they're the

301
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,920
other critical infrastructure

302
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,000
and if they're affected then we are all

303
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,480
affected

304
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,399
the other thing that i saw from the

305
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,440
report was that more than one in four

306
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,600
receivers of these ripple effects of

307
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,000
these sorts of breaches ended up paying

308
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,480
all the costs even though it wasn't

309
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,160
their breach

310
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,240
think about that for a minute

311
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,320
it will end up costing organizations

312
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,760
that

313
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,399
maybe were already secure

314
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,959
but they were affected somehow by a

315
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,360
breach in one of one part of this

316
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,200
ecosystem one part of this web

317
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,480
so um

318
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,880
talking with some people about what they

319
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,519
felt we owed one another here's a great

320
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,480
quote from the carl nicole peroth who is

321
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,360
uh

322
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,880
you may know as the former new york

323
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,480
times journalist who wrote this is how

324
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,959
they tell me the world ends

325
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,200
she says i not only put myself at risk i

326
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,839
put an ecosystem at risk i risk becoming

327
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,200
patient zero in an attack on my sources

328
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,160
on my employer my partners on an entire

329
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,160
supply chain

330
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,880
so it's not just enough to say everybody

331
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,560
has to take care of themselves in

332
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,959
security everyone has to secure their

333
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,560
own organization

334
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,240
no matter what happens they can become

335
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,920
they can affect

336
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,320
other groups and not necessarily just

337
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,120
their customers

338
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,200
so shared risk

339
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,800
requires shared defenses

340
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,519
and as uh u.s national cyber director

341
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,360
chris english says the notion of a

342
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,160
shared defense is a statement of reality

343
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,880
not of choice

344
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,760
it's already too late to deny this it's

345
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,279
already too late to back out

346
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,079
in uh their ex their excellent um

347
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,399
article in foreign was it foreign

348
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,320
policies foreign affairs sorry i'm still

349
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,639
a little jet lagged uh they wrote a

350
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,800
durable solution must involve moving

351
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,399
away from the tendency to charge

352
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,959
isolated individuals small businesses

353
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,639
and local governments with shouldering

354
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,760
absurd

355
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,600
levels of risk

356
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,680
those more capable of carrying the load

357
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,920
such as governments and large firms must

358
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,639
take on some of the burden

359
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,480
and collective collaborative defense

360
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,880
needs to replace atomized and divided

361
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,040
efforts until then the problem will

362
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,480
always look like someone else's dissolve

363
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,040
if you take nothing else away from this

364
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,000
talk

365
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,680
i think this says it all

366
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,360
i i should have just asked chris to do

367
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,279
this talk that probably would have been

368
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,720
better

369
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,320
now let me talk about something i've

370
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,399
been thinking about for a long time

371
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,959
the security poverty line

372
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,000
when i uh first started as cso i was

373
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,760
working for a swiss bank

374
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,360
i was working in

375
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,440
zurich and london

376
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,839
and i had a really big budget

377
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,600
then i moved back home to texas and

378
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,079
worked for the texas education education

379
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,800
agency and i had a really tiny budget

380
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,120
in fact i had a zero budget

381
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,120
i walked in my first day on the job i

382
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,040
was the only security person i had no

383
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
people reporting to me and they said we

384
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,639
need your budget request by the end of

385
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,160
the day

386
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,040
so i sat down and wrote down about i

387
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,560
think i asked about for about two

388
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,480
thousand dollars i asked for a logging

389
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,240
server and a couple of books

390
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,000
and the person i was reporting to

391
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,079
scratched it out and she said where do

392
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,600
you think you are the private sector

393
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,839
so i had zero budget

394
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,560
and zero people when i started out

395
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,199
and since then i have been very

396
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,759
interested in the topic of how smaller

397
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,759
organizations deal with security and

398
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,600
even if they can

399
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,320
because there are so many

400
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,959
dynamics that come into play that create

401
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,440
that line below which an organization

402
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,639
cannot effectively protect itself

403
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,560
it's not just money it's not just

404
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,759
awareness

405
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,240
it's not just laziness it's not just

406
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,560
lack of prioritization as so many people

407
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,639
like to think

408
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,680
let me talk a little bit about it

409
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,320
i've divided what they need up into into

410
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,560
four categories there may be more if you

411
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,599
think of more let me know

412
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,040
i look at it as being money expertise

413
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,920
capability and influence

414
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,680
so first of all can they actually afford

415
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,839
the financial costs of the tools and the

416
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,000
people

417
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,160
and for expertise do they know what

418
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,639
constitutes essential security and how

419
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,720
to go about implementing it

420
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,800
and i would argue that yes there have

421
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,680
been

422
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,720
um

423
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,519
many you know controls listed lots of

424
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,440
nice checklists created but i would

425
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,480
argue

426
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,360
that we still can't just give them a

427
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,079
very simple list

428
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,160
almost 10 years ago when i was an

429
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,959
analyst i did a research project asking

430
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,759
people asking security professionals

431
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,319
this hypothetical i'm a new cso it's my

432
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,160
first day on the job in an organization

433
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,000
that never has never done security

434
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,520
before what should i buy

435
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,839
now you'll recognize this as my actual

436
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,000
first day on the job at the texas

437
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,959
education agency this actually happened

438
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,559
i would ask people and they would say oh

439
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,839
that's ridiculous that would never

440
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,280
happen

441
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,640
guess what it still happens all the time

442
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,559
i still have people coming to me and

443
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,880
saying i'm a consultant i'm helping an

444
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,720
organization they haven't done security

445
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,799
before what should i tell them to do

446
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,720
first

447
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,760
and uh people like nick selby said i

448
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,679
hate this question and everything about

449
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,559
it because i don't know how to answer it

450
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,080
everybody said it depends

451
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,160
i just asked them an open-ended question

452
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,600
because i wanted to see how many

453
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,240
technologies they would list

454
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,000
just as a baseline

455
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,320
some listed four different technologies

456
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,559
some listed 31

457
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,000
and you can guess that the ones who

458
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,640
listed 31 worked for a bank

459
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,799
they could buy one of everything

460
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,559
so they considered everything essential

461
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,880
but the bottom line when you kind of

462
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,400
averaged everything out what people

463
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,360
listed it kind of matched up to pci

464
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,240
now remember pci is trying to manage a

465
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,280
risk

466
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,760
a very scoped well understood risk

467
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,200
certain types of data strings

468
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,120
but if you're just trying to say in

469
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,799
general for an organization they would

470
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,559
say well it depends on the vertical it

471
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,200
depends on the size it depends on how

472
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,600
distributed they are and all sorts of

473
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,559
things

474
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,720
it included firewalls and av remember

475
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,760
everybody's saying that av is dead and

476
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,480
you know firewalls firewalls don't work

477
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,080
you can't not say firewalls you cannot

478
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,600
say no no you don't need to buy those

479
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,679
those are fine no you have to buy them

480
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,039
anyway

481
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,400
but

482
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,039
i then went out with this list to

483
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,280
vendors and i said i'm a 1 000 person

484
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,360
organization i need to buy these things

485
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,120
how much do they cost

486
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,520
and they said well it depends we need to

487
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,600
have a two hour sales meeting with you

488
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,679
how about a steak

489
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,799
and

490
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,200
they would not tell me for the most part

491
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,120
how much it cost

492
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,520
only a few vendors actually had any

493
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,799
price lists on their website

494
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,720
so after all of this and then figuring

495
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,480
out well how many people would i really

496
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,039
need to run each of these products

497
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,400
and everything

498
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,320
fudging around i found that i could be

499
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,720
off by as much as a factor of four

500
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
trying to figure out with uh sitting in

501
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,039
front of an empty spreadsheet going

502
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,000
well

503
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
i think i need one of these and i need

504
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,600
two of those

505
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,520
i don't know

506
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,840
so there's still after all this there's

507
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,520
still no guarantee that you won't get

508
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,600
breached

509
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,760
we do not know what constitutes

510
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,120
effective security much less whether

511
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,440
it's actually affordable to small

512
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,840
organizations i will challenge anybody

513
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,760
who says that this is not true come on

514
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,360
i'll i'll fight you i'll fight you

515
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,760
outside

516
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,559
so even assuming that the small

517
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,960
enterprise and actually this can happen

518
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,720
to large enterprises too that they can

519
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,880
be below the security poverty line

520
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,520
assuming they know what to do

521
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,120
can they carry it out or are they

522
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,240
blocked

523
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,039
by

524
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,679
certain situations or logistics if you

525
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,360
don't run your own network you can't put

526
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,520
a firewall on it

527
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,320
there are all sorts of situations

528
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,159
that constrain

529
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,600
organizations depending on you know what

530
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,720
they are

531
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,559
what sector they're in and what their

532
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,280
company culture is if you're a very web

533
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,520
forward organization

534
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,440
um probably

535
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,360
you you won't find it difficult to buy

536
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,039
whatever new technologies you want to

537
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,039
try out because the idea is we're we're

538
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,880
bleeding to lead we're going to do

539
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,840
everything as hard as possible

540
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,120
in hospitality one of the key tenets is

541
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,200
that you never disrupt the guest

542
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,400
experience

543
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,039
because customers can leave that brand

544
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,640
and they may not come back for six or

545
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,360
seven years so you're not going to put

546
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,919
anything in place security wise that

547
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,919
creates any kind of friction which is

548
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,559
why you don't see a whole lot of

549
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,200
two-factor authentication yet

550
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,679
associated with

551
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,360
your customer experience in the

552
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,120
hospitality industry

553
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,840
if you are a telco any sort of security

554
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,240
control that could potentially block

555
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,120
traffic is anathema

556
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,280
you're going to have a hard time pushing

557
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,440
through something that will do that

558
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,880
and of course if you're a security

559
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,280
vendor like cisco is

560
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,280
we'd better be good at it ourselves

561
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,880
because that'll look really bad if we're

562
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,120
not

563
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,440
i'm sure we're going to be talking a lot

564
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
this week at the conference about these

565
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,120
dichotomies

566
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,840
safety versus security and privacy

567
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,600
versus security those are other big

568
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,280
things that can

569
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,240
hinder

570
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
an organization and keep it below the

571
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,640
security poverty line

572
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,200
if you are at an institute of higher

573
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,159
education you know that free speech

574
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,480
especially in the united states is is

575
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,679
paramount

576
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,600
so you better not be blocking anybody

577
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,840
from saying anything

578
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,440
you will have professors that say this

579
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,200
is my grant money i'll spend it where i

580
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,640
want

581
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,320
and then when they run out of grant

582
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,000
money then they're keeping their

583
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,360
equipment even though they can't afford

584
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,360
the security for it anymore

585
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,640
i see helen going yeah yeah

586
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,200
all of these things

587
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,440
and then there's influence

588
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,440
can they cause the right changes in

589
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,200
their suppliers and their stakeholders

590
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,200
if you're a large company like i don't

591
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,440
know american airlines you can say to

592
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,280
your supplier you need to fix this or

593
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,559
we're going to find ourselves another

594
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,640
supplier and they'll do it

595
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,400
if you are a smaller one let's say if

596
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,480
you're a texas state agency

597
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,640
first of all your vendors tend to be

598
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,760
small

599
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,240
um you know like two or three people

600
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,799
organizations historically underutilized

601
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,080
businesses

602
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,039
um

603
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:17,760
peop

604
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,840
organizations that went bust a long time

605
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,200
ago

606
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,720
your brother's cousin's uncle's nephew

607
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,120
who wrote the original software and is

608
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,039
now living you know

609
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,159
in bali

610
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,240
or something like that

611
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,840
or they will say to you you're the only

612
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,960
one who's

613
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,559
raised this problem so we're not going

614
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,760
to fix it

615
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,760
or they will say we'll fix it if you pay

616
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,520
us to fix it

617
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,000
so all of these things

618
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,679
make it very hard

619
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,360
in a large supply ecosystem for an

620
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,360
organization under the security poverty

621
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,240
line

622
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,440
to have any effect on what it relies on

623
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,799
they are stuck with the level of

624
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,480
security that vendors are willing to

625
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,039
give to them

626
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,840
so let's look again at what they need

627
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,480
the money the expertise the capability

628
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,880
and the influence

629
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,760
and

630
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,799
by expertise again i want to emphasize

631
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,919
that this is not just awareness training

632
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,600
this is not just

633
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,840
training in a particular product or a

634
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,799
particular technique it's not a cissp

635
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,559
expertise

636
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,760
to me is the combination of knowledge

637
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,640
and skills and experience so that you

638
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,320
know what to do with something you have

639
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,919
never seen before

640
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,240
which let's face it is what we do every

641
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,159
day in security right

642
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,679
we are looking at something and going

643
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,679
well that just happened

644
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,000
okay what do we do now

645
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,720
this is what is missing from these

646
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,039
security poor organizations

647
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,919
even if we give them a cissp each for

648
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:52,799
free

649
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,400
that is not going to replace or give

650
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,919
them the expertise that they need to

651
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,640
handle something which by the way when

652
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,559
the war broke out in ukraine which is

653
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,159
why cisco

654
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,159
not only sent out um endpoint software

655
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,559
to organizations in ukraine i think

656
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,559
we're covering about 19 000 endpoints

657
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,520
right now but our own people

658
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,279
are running

659
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,000
those endpoint software products and are

660
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,400
doing the threat hunting so we are also

661
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,200
giving our expertise to them not just

662
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,720
throwing a product over and saying good

663
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,000
luck

664
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,720
let us know how it goes

665
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,760
here's another great quote from sarah

666
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,679
krisha i don't know if you know her but

667
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,279
she is a freelance

668
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,760
journalist who covers cyber security out

669
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,440
of austria

670
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,840
in 1989 two things happened within weeks

671
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,000
of each other the berlin wall fell and

672
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,919
tim berners-lee created the world wide

673
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,520
web

674
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,080
this started the vision of a global

675
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,360
world where we would all come together

676
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,440
but now it's the internet of many in the

677
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,200
hands of a few

678
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,039
if we want to return to a democratic

679
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,360
state we need to get it back to societal

680
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,000
common ground

681
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
so that's the other dynamic that we have

682
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,520
to face and have to work with

683
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,799
that it is not as democratic as in as

684
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,480
sorry as democratic and internet as we

685
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,960
need it to be if we are all to come

686
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,840
together to work on securing it

687
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,918
so let's start with the fundamentals

688
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
what should we be doing

689
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,919
we need to address the money problem

690
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,720
that's that's true but again it's not

691
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,799
just a matter of pipeline it's not just

692
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,200
a matter of we're going to train 5 000

693
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,440
new cyber people

694
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,880
again

695
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,840
it's not just training it's expertise

696
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,200
it's experience it's lived

697
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,039
its knowledge gained by living through

698
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,279
it by practicing

699
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,679
so we need expertise not awareness and

700
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:00,880
we need

701
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,279
we need to migrate

702
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,799
from legacy environments wherever we can

703
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:07,600
and

704
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,240
i know that the g7 yesterday just

705
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,840
announced a new initiative

706
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,880
in in terms of infrastructure

707
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,399
a lot of this is very is very needed

708
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:25,360
uh it's building up capabilities for

709
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,039
manufacturing vaccine for example in

710
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,360
poorer countries

711
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,720
upgrading

712
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,520
telecommunications and things like that

713
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,760
that sort of infrastructure is really

714
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,640
important but it stops short of

715
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,120
the actual cyber part

716
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,919
now when uh we did some research over

717
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,520
the last couple of years together with

718
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,679
the scientia institute

719
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,679
which was also founded by some folks who

720
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,399
founded the verizon dbir

721
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,720
and we wanted to look at

722
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,919
security outcomes not just what people

723
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,480
were doing in security but what actually

724
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,080
works

725
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,039
and

726
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,120
you can read those reports for free if

727
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,200
you want to look at them

728
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,159
we looked at 25 different security

729
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,840
practices and then

730
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,679
looked to see if there was any

731
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,559
statistical correlation with 11 security

732
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,600
outcomes not just not getting hacked but

733
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,039
also you know keeping up with the

734
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,120
business minimizing unplanned work

735
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,520
recruiting and retaining talent

736
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,840
meeting compliance requirements you know

737
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,679
those sorts of things

738
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,039
and one of the top things that we found

739
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,679
and i swear i did not do this myself

740
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,919
the top one of the top practices that we

741
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,399
found was having a proactive tech

742
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,520
refresh

743
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,600
practice

744
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,559
that affected statistically the security

745
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,720
outcomes across the board

746
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,799
everything from recruiting and retaining

747
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,799
talent which makes sense because you

748
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,880
know nobody wants to be a db2 admin for

749
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,840
their entire career

750
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,240
but also

751
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,080
everything making it easier to keep up

752
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,840
with what the business wants refreshing

753
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,279
that technology

754
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,240
then we looked last year at well okay

755
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,679
refreshing technology what does that

756
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,320
mean does that mean refreshing i.t does

757
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,679
that mean refreshing security how often

758
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,240
who does it how does it work the best

759
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,799
and we did find that in general if you

760
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,159
have a modernized infrastructure that is

761
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,600
cloud-based and that is centralized you

762
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,919
have statistically the best chance of

763
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,240
reporting good security outcomes and a

764
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,600
good security refresh practice

765
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,399
so

766
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,640
putting all those things together if we

767
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,840
can help

768
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,799
modernize legacy infrastructure that

769
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,720
security poor organizations are dealing

770
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,679
with

771
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,919
hopefully we will set them up for more

772
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,480
success and security but that's good as

773
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,640
you can see that's that it's not a

774
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,760
direct

775
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,320
express lane it's going to take a long

776
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,320
time starting with

777
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,880
uh migrating from legacy environments

778
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,120
i've tried to migrate into the cloud it

779
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,960
didn't go well

780
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,520
so i i'm i'm not saying this blithely

781
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,000
i'm i'm but i am saying that as far as

782
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,320
we can tell with the data that we have

783
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,360
it is necessary

784
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,440
so what do we owe

785
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,760
these organizations

786
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,279
here are some questions that i've been

787
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,000
thinking about

788
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,440
for security costs and spending

789
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,000
what what would we owe them is there a

790
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,159
minimum amount that everybody needs to

791
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,600
spend on security do we know what it is

792
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,480
and what if they can't spend it

793
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,440
there are

794
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,679
verticals that only have about one

795
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,760
percent profit margin

796
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,080
like retail like the the little um

797
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,000
corner shops

798
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,080
as opposed to technology which last i

799
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,559
looked at a an average margin of 12

800
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,279
percent they can spend a lot more on it

801
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,559
and then therefore on security then

802
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,320
other verticals can

803
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,840
and you know in the health care sector

804
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,080
if they have any money left over they're

805
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,600
going to get another nurse

806
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,519
or another doctor they are not going to

807
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,840
spend it on more and fancier

808
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,320
i.t also open source is not the answer

809
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,799
i'm sorry love open source but it's not

810
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,880
free if you need people to run it

811
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,360
now this can be a lot cheaper where

812
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,360
labor is cheaper

813
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,440
skilled labor is cheaper for example in

814
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,279
south america

815
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,440
they you see a lot more usage of open

816
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,360
source software because i t

817
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,120
professionals

818
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,320
are a lot easier to come by there

819
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,480
should we provide some basic security

820
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,919
infrastructure or controls

821
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,440
or create a subsidized service

822
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,640
now we're starting to get here into

823
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,559
issues of whether the government should

824
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,919
be doing this

825
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,840
and i know in the united states we don't

826
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,679
trust our government at all as far as we

827
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,000
can throw them which is not very far

828
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,640
um but that doesn't have to be that way

829
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,880
look at estonia

830
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,279
when when the citizenry has a much

831
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,840
better more trusting relationship with

832
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,000
its government that opens up a lot more

833
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,880
possibilities to have centralized

834
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,919
security that not every business or

835
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,840
every organization has to pay for itself

836
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,840
and furthermore what security should be

837
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,000
built in now i'm talking with

838
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,919
as a vendor to all other vendors out

839
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,000
here what should we be building in and

840
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,320
therefore it should be available at no

841
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,919
extra charge

842
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,799
you hear about the sso tax

843
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:41,919
that

844
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,320
bob reuters talks about

845
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,639
that

846
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,279
single sign-on costs extra

847
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,919
and it really shouldn't

848
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,000
there are other things that different

849
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,519
levels of logging

850
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,399
different

851
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,200
types of functionality that ideally

852
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,960
should be available to everyone without

853
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,720
having to buy the platinum premium

854
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,600
edition of something

855
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,960
is there a base level of incident

856
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,360
response functionality

857
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,679
that all vendors should be making

858
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,159
affordable should be making available at

859
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,000
no extra charge or available for free

860
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,039
that's the other question too

861
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,480
what do we owe

862
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,480
other organizations what do we owe one

863
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,000
another in terms of our expertise

864
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,240
and again it's not just it's great when

865
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,399
everybody teaches classes

866
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,399
that's wonderful it's very nice

867
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,240
if you can't afford to go

868
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,480
it doesn't help

869
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,480
most of the people who attend

870
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,399
conferences like these

871
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,039
you know get have it paid for

872
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,080
what do we do with those who are not i.t

873
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,159
people but who are somehow in charge of

874
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,880
i.t at their organization how do we help

875
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,840
them

876
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,480
how do we go to where they are do we

877
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,919
create a kind of a cyber peace corps

878
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,519
where people volunteer to do

879
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,839
to do service

880
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,599
in a cyber security capacity

881
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,960
that's something we can think about

882
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,280
things like well

883
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,679
here at these conferences we will always

884
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,199
talk about sharing more information

885
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,359
sharing more information i help to stand

886
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,280
up the retail ice act so i know just how

887
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,918
difficult it is to actually share the

888
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,599
right type of information with the right

889
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,520
people at the right time

890
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,040
at the right level of detail

891
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,480
but things like the national

892
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,879
transportation safety board idea for

893
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,639
cyber which i think has launched it's

894
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,000
launched right

895
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,040
that should help us take some things

896
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,918
that

897
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,320
up until now have been just within our

898
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,960
circles and make them more publicly

899
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,480
available to people who need to hear

900
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,520
them even if they don't know it

901
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,560
um

902
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,880
security products i think should be

903
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,880
required it should be designed to

904
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,280
require less arcane security expertise

905
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,520
and i know this really hurts engineers

906
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,000
who have spent years building really

907
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,040
fancy consoles but i can tell you that

908
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,760
the average it admin is not going to sit

909
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,920
there and admire your console

910
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,119
they're not going to sit there and click

911
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,800
everything to see what it does they have

912
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,880
a job to do you are just one of many

913
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,040
consoles they want to get in they want

914
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,640
to solve whatever problem it is and they

915
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,960
want to get back out again

916
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,520
so can we design better security

917
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,000
products that don't require

918
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,960
the love and caring and admiration and

919
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,839
geekery that we are all used to

920
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,520
um

921
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,680
visibility and transparency are great

922
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,240
but you have to know what to do about it

923
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,240
so just information sharing is not

924
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,440
enough

925
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,560
uh again it's it's great but it is not

926
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,119
sufficient

927
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,240
we do need a bigger pipeline we need to

928
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,040
support all paths into security i myself

929
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,240
am a liberal arts dropout

930
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,880
and i only got into security because i

931
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,640
had studied languages and i ended up

932
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,240
working in switzerland

933
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,520
so there you have it

934
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,040
now the the other really

935
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,800
controversial thing that i want to lay

936
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,599
in front of you is

937
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,480
for the last 10 years at least

938
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,400
the cyber security expertise has been

939
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,240
going to the highest bidder which tends

940
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,119
to be security vendors or very very

941
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,040
large organizations like banks who can

942
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,800
afford them

943
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,880
i don't know what the latest

944
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,560
uh dfir

945
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,720
top salary is but last i heard it was

946
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,800
five hundred thousand dollars

947
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,720
base salary

948
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,640
nobody nobody can afford that except the

949
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,920
very few

950
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,079
we have to move this expertise out of

951
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,359
the hands of the very few into the many

952
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,960
i don't know how we're going to do that

953
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,160
but

954
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,280
i'm raising it here

955
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,580
oh thank you trey

956
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,869
[Applause]

957
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,079
capability this is the hardest one to

958
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,520
help with

959
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,599
this is really difficult because it has

960
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,680
everything to do with company culture

961
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,079
with technology environment with

962
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,640
physical environment with

963
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,480
everything else that affects the

964
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,119
business of an organization

965
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,720
but can we

966
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,920
create architecture standards to create

967
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,520
better outcomes for cyber security

968
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,560
can we

969
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,400
enable better tech refresh and

970
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,560
integration practices we're starting to

971
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,079
learn with our research about what

972
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,200
facilitates better integration

973
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,800
i learned another really interesting

974
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,960
thing leading a workshop last week in

975
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,520
london at infosec where we were talking

976
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,720
about how to create okrs and action

977
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,280
items for and metrics for

978
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,800
these things that came out of our

979
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,800
security outcome study

980
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,280
and i was talking about integration and

981
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,520
the three choices we had given

982
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,079
the companies that we surveyed were out

983
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,480
of the box integration

984
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,079
using a preferred vendor that had

985
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,640
pre-integrated you know everything in a

986
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,720
platform approach and diy integration

987
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,119
and one person raised their hand and

988
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,839
said that was a false choice

989
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,400
that as an mssp

990
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,320
they were never happy with any kind of

991
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,560
integration no matter how they got to it

992
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,839
they always had to add some diy on top

993
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,280
so again it depends on what your

994
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,359
standards are for

995
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,040
for integration

996
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,440
uh you may always have to be adding

997
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,280
things on top of it and again this is

998
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,200
something that security poor

999
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,160
organizations are not set up to do

1000
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,240
they will take whatever integration

1001
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,680
comes ideally from a preferred vendor

1002
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,599
may be out of the box but if they get

1003
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:02,960
out of the box

1004
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,320
they often

1005
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,720
don't get around to it

1006
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,400
unless it's already done because they

1007
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,839
have plenty of other things they have to

1008
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,200
deal with

1009
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,520
so how can we create better integration

1010
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,079
outcomes better tech refresh outcomes

1011
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,880
with security standards in an affordable

1012
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,480
way

1013
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,800
can we move non-core business functions

1014
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,200
to the cloud we already have that for

1015
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,359
the most part with email there's only so

1016
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,440
much differentiation you can do with

1017
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,480
email

1018
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,280
you

1019
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,320
you know and and things are

1020
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,839
consolidating on certain providers

1021
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,400
payroll has been outsourced and

1022
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,880
effectively in the cloud for

1023
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,119
one decade two decades i don't know hard

1024
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,440
to say but we hardly ever think about it

1025
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,520
but it's a non-core business function

1026
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,160
what else could we help organizations

1027
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,079
move

1028
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,800
can we make vertical specific reference

1029
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,520
architectures not compliance checklists

1030
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,280
but actually this is what tends to work

1031
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,760
for health care this is what tends to

1032
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,200
work best for post offices

1033
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,960
whatever can we build more of those

1034
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,800
there's some efforts to do that right

1035
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,839
now but we could sure use a lot more and

1036
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,560
it's a lot easier for those in a very

1037
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,280
constricted environment

1038
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,760
where let's say vendors don't typically

1039
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,440
build integrations for their types of

1040
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,960
software

1041
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,800
to be able to find out that this is

1042
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,280
where the role of system integrators i

1043
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,920
think deserves more attention

1044
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,680
where can we work more with system

1045
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,160
integrators to bring more security

1046
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,400
functionality because that's where those

1047
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,400
companies are going to go

1048
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,880
and is there a shared responsibility

1049
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,400
model that we can actually agree on

1050
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,920
can we agree on

1051
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,000
one um

1052
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,760
i'm seeing a no

1053
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,680
anybody disagree i think you're about to

1054
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,400
propose more uh no actually i am not

1055
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,720
about to propose one because

1056
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,560
everyone has a shared responsibility

1057
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,920
model until they get punched in the logs

1058
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,599
this is something that i always had to

1059
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,920
struggle with as a cso

1060
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,160
just the idea of well you should have

1061
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,920
been keeping better logs you should have

1062
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,960
been logging at a deeper level nobody

1063
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,880
will turn on debug

1064
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,119
level logging unless you're pretty sure

1065
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,200
there's already an incident and by then

1066
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,040
it's too late

1067
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,400
so

1068
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,040
what do we owe what should we be

1069
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,440
providing by default what is the best

1070
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,319
level

1071
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,280
to have for all eventualities i don't

1072
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,920
know if we can if we can do that but

1073
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,680
uh we really do

1074
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,280
have to get better at the shared

1075
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,880
responsibility model because that's

1076
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,280
often just a proxy for saying yeah you

1077
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,520
should we thought you were doing that

1078
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,760
or we're sorry you know that's going to

1079
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,520
be extra if you want us to do that we're

1080
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,800
going to have to you're going to have to

1081
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,359
pay us more

1082
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,400
finally what do we owe each other in

1083
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,200
terms of influence

1084
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,599
i think this is some place where we can

1085
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,800
help more for those companies under the

1086
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,960
security poverty line whether you're a

1087
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,520
cso at one of those organizations who

1088
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,839
cannot convince their management to give

1089
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,000
them any more budget to do something

1090
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,880
or

1091
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,680
whether you are a group of organizations

1092
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,839
in a specific vertical

1093
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,400
who can come together and maybe wield

1094
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,040
more power as a group the ice acts are

1095
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,480
pretty good for this but not everybody

1096
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,440
can afford to join an isac

1097
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,680
is there a way that larger organizations

1098
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,760
that have more weight can throw that

1099
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,079
weight around to benefit

1100
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,720
not necessarily just customers but

1101
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,720
you know the community at large

1102
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,400
everybody

1103
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,720
not just donating but actually putting

1104
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,760
skin

1105
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,119
in the game

1106
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,200
putting things on the line

1107
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,400
to use

1108
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,240
the influence maybe the outsized

1109
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,560
influence that they have today

1110
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,680
to say we need to build this we need to

1111
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,280
make this easier for organizations

1112
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,280
and

1113
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,440
we there was some discussion about how

1114
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,359
to identify a linchpin in the

1115
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:12,560
organization

1116
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,880
remember nobody had heard of blackbaud

1117
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,200
until it was attacked by ransomware and

1118
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,280
then a thousand organizations were

1119
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,280
affected by it

1120
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,520
so we don't necessarily know

1121
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,240
where the linchpin organizations are we

1122
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,839
don't know who's going to take everybody

1123
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,119
else down i mean sure we know the

1124
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,839
biggest and obvious ones

1125
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,079
especially the cloud providers but we

1126
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,240
don't know everybody in the supply

1127
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,319
ecosystem

1128
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,480
it really depends on the the failure

1129
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,200
mode that they go through and how that

1130
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,720
cascades

1131
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,760
so we need to figure out what linchpin

1132
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,760
organizations are as part of our

1133
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,599
ecosystem especially for security

1134
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:52,960
purposes

1135
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,200
and let them know hey did you know we're

1136
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,040
all depending on you and this is the

1137
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,119
sort of support that we expect from you

1138
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,440
we need to balance risk-driven

1139
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,440
regulation between the biggest and the

1140
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,760
loudest organizations and the rest of

1141
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,400
the community you'll notice that we

1142
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,560
always invite banks to come speak at

1143
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,560
cyber security conferences

1144
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,839
we invite the you know the biggest names

1145
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,920
even if they're not that big if we know

1146
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,839
who they are if we know you know they're

1147
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,720
a cool high-tech name we invite them

1148
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,079
we need to invite the voices of those

1149
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,640
who are not as

1150
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,680
sexy or not as high-tech not as cool

1151
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,599
because they have valuable things to say

1152
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,079
about the difficulties of achieving

1153
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,040
cyber security

1154
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,359
this i'm speaking now to conference

1155
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,359
organizers we really need to bring in

1156
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,839
more diversity and i don't necessarily

1157
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,359
mean color skin

1158
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,520
or gender identity or anything like that

1159
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,280
but where they come from what kind of

1160
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,800
business they're doing

1161
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,560
and what they're struggling with we need

1162
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,800
to bring those those voices in because

1163
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,400
it's usually the larger ones that can

1164
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,520
afford to lobby for legislation

1165
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,040
to fix what they

1166
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,079
you know what they think it should be

1167
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,760
i mean i can tell you that having

1168
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,960
studied a lot of smaller retailers when

1169
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,440
it comes to pci dss a lot of the the

1170
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,560
level three or level two just don't

1171
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,000
bother trying to meet the compliance

1172
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,200
requirements they just hope they won't

1173
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,480
get caught

1174
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,280
so the regulation wasn't really for them

1175
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,520
it was you know for the large companies

1176
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,200
am i sounding like a socialist right now

1177
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,160
maybe

1178
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,920
not i'll keep working on it thank you

1179
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,839
and the whole

1180
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,920
cross-border

1181
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,800
military versus civil cyber security

1182
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,680
policy problem

1183
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,920
we still tend to gravitate too much

1184
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,359
either towards the military side and omg

1185
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,599
atp apt

1186
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,599
lmnop

1187
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,680
fancy animals

1188
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,319
versus the sorts of security problems

1189
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,079
that smaller organizations are having

1190
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,000
every day they're not that exciting the

1191
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,839
texas department of insurance is

1192
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,640
probably not dealing with any threat

1193
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,400
actor that has a fancy name

1194
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,880
so we need to pay more attention

1195
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,040
to those and also

1196
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,240
uh work

1197
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,280
cross-border with one another

1198
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,599
and again it's this is not just a nice

1199
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,280
to have we have to do this

1200
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,400
we are all being affected by cyber

1201
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,599
security

1202
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,200
breaches that cross borders already

1203
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,359
we just have to recognize it and realize

1204
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,280
that we need to work together this isn't

1205
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,040
just a matter of

1206
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,359
boosting our trade at the expense of

1207
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,760
another country's trade agenda

1208
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,480
this is not just uh necessarily just a

1209
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,880
case of um

1210
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,440
cyber security offensive teams versus

1211
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,800
one another

1212
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,880
this is not you know playing the cool

1213
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,160
games

1214
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,200
this is

1215
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,800
you know the cool reindeer games where

1216
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,880
everybody's doing ctfs together that's

1217
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,760
great

1218
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,440
but we have to bring it down to the

1219
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,040
level of

1220
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,079
the population the small businesses

1221
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,599
the consumers

1222
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,400
the citizens

1223
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,280
one more quote from professor martin who

1224
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,599
i sure wish were here today

1225
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,240
sure miss you

1226
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,440
i think we need to think about

1227
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,520
cyberspace as an environment where we

1228
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,160
increasingly live and work

1229
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,920
so that means we have obligations to

1230
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,079
each other we have obligations to look

1231
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,880
after our bit of the digital environment

1232
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,960
we've the obligation not to be digital

1233
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,480
pollutants

1234
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,839
that's something we haven't even talked

1235
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,760
about yet in this talk

1236
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,599
we've the obligation not to allow bad

1237
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,680
things to happen on our patch

1238
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,319
again that's great but i think we lean

1239
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,160
too much on that and say well you should

1240
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,839
have been secure you should have secured

1241
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,960
your infrastructure what if they can't

1242
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,720
this is what this whole talk is about

1243
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,440
what if they can't what do we owe in

1244
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,880
terms of help

1245
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,800
because we are being affected by all of

1246
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,520
it

1247
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,200
we've the obligation to work in our

1248
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,599
personal and professional lives to help

1249
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,760
clean up the digital environment

1250
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,040
so bringing this round

1251
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,520
this may be as complicated as battling

1252
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,440
climate change i believe it is

1253
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,000
but i believe at the end of the day it

1254
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,160
is every bit as critical

1255
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,440
it has every bit

1256
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,000
as great a possibility of leaking into

1257
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,559
our actual physical lives affecting

1258
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,240
lives affecting health care

1259
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,640
everything that we care about that we

1260
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,480
have learned in the last few years to

1261
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,480
protect one another and to protect

1262
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,800
ourselves as a group

1263
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,960
applies equally in the cybersecurity

1264
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,280
realm

1265
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,520
it is a pragmatic

1266
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,960
as well as a moral imperative

1267
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,000
i believe it is our civic duty

1268
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,800
to be working on

1269
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,839
helping one another

1270
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,839
and coming together

1271
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,960
we can do more

1272
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,599
and i believe we will do more

1273
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,599
so we should be doing more of this

1274
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,079
together

1275
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,559
i'm ready for your arguments now

1276
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,440
if there are questions i see two

1277
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,200
microphones out there if you just want

1278
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,359
to yell

1279
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,800
well

1280
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,599
thanks hello oh yes hello go ahead there

1281
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,440
are four microphones here actually in

1282
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,319
the back

1283
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,720
carter horpio from any zone i i really

1284
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,880
liked your

1285
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,559
thought of ntsb of cyberspace

1286
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,040
and actually that actually brings back

1287
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,599
uh an interesting question of how

1288
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,119
security is considered in aviation

1289
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,800
and how reporting on security incidents

1290
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,119
is considered to be a norm

1291
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,280
not an exception

1292
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,400
uh i mean it's it's really to report a

1293
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,319
security incident

1294
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:27,520
so that the organization can learn

1295
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,160
not to find not to find the the

1296
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,280
culprits due to who who did wrong but to

1297
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,440
how the organization can learn

1298
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,760
about the security situation

1299
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,640
and

1300
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,400
so that the incident doesn't happen

1301
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,680
again

1302
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,680
we should really consider cyber security

1303
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,040
incidents

1304
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,440
as something in a similar fashion we

1305
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,720
should really

1306
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,800
be more open

1307
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,640
uh i agree with you and in in the

1308
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,720
aviation incidents we understand very

1309
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,480
well now that it is

1310
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,800
a collection of

1311
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,960
different circumstances and particular

1312
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,800
choices and

1313
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,760
and actions that lead to a chain that

1314
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,040
leads to

1315
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,400
the incident

1316
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,559
uh we can do this too

1317
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:13,440
in uh security but the problem is that i

1318
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,920
find when we compare it with aviation

1319
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,000
that it turns out that the toddler in

1320
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,359
seat 21c actually did something you know

1321
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,280
that because it's not just the pilot

1322
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,839
flying the plane in cyber security if it

1323
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,359
were if we just had one trained

1324
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,359
professional flying the whole thing we

1325
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,040
probably wouldn't have the problems that

1326
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,920
we do so i think there's a lot more

1327
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,240
or they changed uh you know one of the

1328
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,160
wings in mid-flight and that created the

1329
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,720
problem or

1330
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,640
you know this is a really really old

1331
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,520
plane it's a legacy plane uh yes

1332
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,119
mainframes

1333
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,599
legacy mainframe was still flying fine

1334
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,200
until it wasn't

1335
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,280
and and things like that so

1336
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,119
i think the analogy breaks down somewhat

1337
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,880
but i agree with you that we should be

1338
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,920
able to

1339
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,280
um

1340
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,559
analyze as much as we can and share that

1341
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,640
information about security incidents the

1342
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,880
problem is that some of the aspects of

1343
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,520
the security incident are so close to

1344
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,880
the business

1345
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,359
so close to

1346
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,920
aspects of the business that can only be

1347
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,240
revealed in the case of a public company

1348
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,800
very very carefully so as not to disrupt

1349
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,440
markets or you know that they consider

1350
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,000
to be a competitive advantage and it's

1351
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,079
really hard to peel apart the security

1352
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,720
from the business

1353
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,520
one additional comment here is

1354
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,640
is that some areas in uh have actually

1355
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,640
mandatory reporting even on cyber

1356
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,960
security incidents nowadays

1357
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,920
this should be really considered by the

1358
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,319
party

1359
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:48,960
receiving these mandatory reports

1360
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,440
as to not to punish

1361
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,240
but to how i can help you

1362
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,960
yes how i can help you to elevate the

1363
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,680
situation you you have reported now yes

1364
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,480
we as search we as national seasons we

1365
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,280
should really have this how can help you

1366
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,280
how can i help you yes that's a that's a

1367
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,160
very good that's a very good attitude

1368
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,839
that we should encourage

1369
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:13,040
trey

1370
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,680
is this on so i want to just echo a

1371
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,200
little bit add a little bit on this

1372
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,720
aviation theme and then i have one of

1373
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,240
those infamous not a question but a

1374
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,920
comment sit down in in my pilot training

1375
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,480
one of the things that i learned was

1376
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,760
like the vast majority of air accidents

1377
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,480
the root cause outcome is determined to

1378
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,480
be human error

1379
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,960
[Music]

1380
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,720
and when you sit in a cockpit whether

1381
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,119
it's a small plane or a big you know

1382
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,359
trans oceanic jet

1383
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:44,079
you're looking at an array

1384
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:45,359
quite like you know a lot of the

1385
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,040
dashboards that vendors like to build

1386
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,440
into their tools

1387
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,800
the position of each and every

1388
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,760
instrument every switch every safety

1389
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,040
cover every secondary backup system

1390
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,280
there's a human death associated with

1391
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,960
that and sure in the post mortem of an

1392
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,520
accident a particular individual may

1393
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,440
have been found to be at fault but the

1394
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,400
difference in that more mature industry

1395
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,880
is that the vendors who make the tools

1396
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,079
go back and adapt the tools to make them

1397
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,559
fail safe in that failure mode and as an

1398
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,079
industry security tools are insecure

1399
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,480
they're hostile they often ship with

1400
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,160
default configurations that are

1401
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,640
dangerous out of the box and here i come

1402
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,640
to my comment which is this

1403
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,200
the the halting problem is still an open

1404
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,880
question right

1405
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,720
what is the halting problem it's

1406
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,160
basically like here's some random

1407
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,880
program can you programmatically

1408
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,119
determine whether it will stop or go

1409
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,599
into an infinite loop right

1410
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,799
like is this binary malicious

1411
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:55,839
is a subset of that problem i would

1412
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:57,920
submit to you

1413
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,240
i don't think we're gonna

1414
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,160
maybe be alive when this is solved

1415
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,559
definitively for the mathematicians but

1416
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,880
if i was a betting man i would say

1417
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,960
that it's not going to be solved

1418
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,640
probably in

1419
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,880
our lifetime maybe a few generations

1420
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,720
maybe ever

1421
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,760
if we

1422
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,880
said though

1423
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,760
let us

1424
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,720
work

1425
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,040
as though to cure the patient

1426
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,440
and not as though

1427
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,520
we were rent seekers

1428
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,839
i wonder how that would transform this

1429
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:29,200
ecosystem

1430
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,359
yeah yeah good point

1431
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,640
very good point thank you

1432
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,599
aaron

1433
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,920
is this on here yeah erin captain here

1434
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,119
uh actually

1435
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,160
i had

1436
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,920
an idea that i you know wanted to bring

1437
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,839
back about the pollution the pollution

1438
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,760
concept really rang a bell with me yeah

1439
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,680
but trey just gave me that the tennis

1440
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,559
ball to continue so the halting problem

1441
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:53,280
is unsolvable undecidable right so yeah

1442
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,200
there you go um so you know is it secure

1443
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,440
is i would also argue it's a sub problem

1444
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,079
with that so um and i would say the

1445
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:04,559
pollution part of that which rang in

1446
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,880
your talk rang about with me

1447
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,839
is

1448
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:10,880
basically um the question like you know

1449
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,319
was that code mathematically so sound

1450
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:17,040
that it actually you know is

1451
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,799
is provably correct right

1452
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,520
hard problem right um

1453
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,880
related with theoretical computer

1454
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,200
sciences holding et cetera um so the

1455
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,040
pollution part is like did the other

1456
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,079
programmer or developer or vendor create

1457
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:33,119
a

1458
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,480
clean

1459
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,599
system

1460
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:36,640
and

1461
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,359
not only that

1462
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:41,520
the difference where i think it breaks

1463
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:44,960
down to aviation is uh nature doesn't

1464
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,359
intentionally attack us and currently at

1465
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,599
least yeah i mean maybe climate change

1466
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,319
might yeah but there's no real you know

1467
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:55,200
human with that intention behind it yeah

1468
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,480
uh in in our world there is so this is

1469
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,400
the difference in the in the in the risk

1470
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,760
modeling that you have to take into

1471
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,880
account because the attacker will adjust

1472
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,200
right the sentient adversary exactly

1473
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:12,319
yeah yeah so i i prefer the model of

1474
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:15,200
pollution is the unsafe software

1475
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,400
and

1476
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,520
the the let's help each other part is

1477
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,720
actually the way to clean up the

1478
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,319
pollution

1479
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,960
and i think if you if we manage to

1480
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,599
to strengthen that concept

1481
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:29,599
and bring it out to those who are not

1482
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,359
here in the conference

1483
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:33,599
and include them as you said as much as

1484
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:34,799
possible

1485
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:35,839
um

1486
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,760
then this sets a role model and this is

1487
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,960
where we're good at humans uh like to to

1488
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,280
you know bring people to the same

1489
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,359
actions eventually it takes a lot of

1490
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,280
efforts but i think this is how we need

1491
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,119
to address this so maybe a comment on

1492
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:49,839
you

1493
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:51,680
yeah good thoughts

1494
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,919
thank you

1495
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,400
so

1496
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,760
you or me

1497
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,799
okay me excuse me

1498
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:02,400
a little bit someone else

1499
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,960
over here

1500
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,880
all right

1501
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,799
yeah oh okay

1502
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:12,160
i think your budget cyber security is a

1503
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,319
problem is a little bit bigger than you

1504
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:16,880
let out to be because it's actually more

1505
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,359
the whole organization i'm in healthcare

1506
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:20,640
research

1507
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,680
and

1508
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,359
we have

1509
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,160
investigators who are using

1510
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,640
two million dollar mass spectrometers or

1511
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,079
on microscopes yeah that are running

1512
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:34,720
on windows xp and other implicated

1513
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,720
systems because it works fine doesn't it

1514
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,359
yeah it works fine and they don't have

1515
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:40,160
the

1516
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,799
budget to take out their

1517
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:45,440
important research to buy a brand new

1518
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,119
system

1519
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:48,079
so

1520
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,640
we have to figure out ways to

1521
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,760
make these

1522
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,319
make it easier for these small companies

1523
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,880
that do not have the expertise to

1524
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,480
constantly

1525
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,119
and update their operating systems or

1526
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:04,319
even build security into their systems

1527
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,200
right and and when our when our um

1528
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,640
research

1529
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,200
discovered that having proactive tech

1530
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,119
refresh strategies resulted in better

1531
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,440
security outcomes my first thought was

1532
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,040
well what about the ones that can't

1533
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,480
refresh

1534
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,160
whether they simply can't like you're

1535
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,480
talking about with windows xp

1536
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,119
it's one of the most stable functional

1537
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,200
operating systems out there why would

1538
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,599
you change that it it can be

1539
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,319
prohibitively expensive to roll trucks

1540
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,200
to all the millions of kiosks still

1541
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,280
running xp

1542
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,599
what about the the multi-million dollar

1543
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:42,319
ct scanners that literally cannot hold

1544
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:45,040
any more patches not even to update the

1545
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,720
operating system much less security

1546
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,200
patches it's a huge problem and you're

1547
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,280
right that's that's an aspect of it i

1548
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,960
think we owe it to

1549
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,280
our critical organizations like

1550
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,599
healthcare research to

1551
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,559
be able to go back and not

1552
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:02,720
tell them well you should just update

1553
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,359
because you can't

1554
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:07,759
thank you

1555
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,000
you um you mentioned that open source

1556
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,640
software is costly to run

1557
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,799
so it's commercial products but what

1558
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:18,480
would be i am

1559
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,880
needed from the open source community to

1560
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,040
lower the cost of all these tools what

1561
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,839
is your um opinion or advice on on

1562
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:29,359
that oh boy that could be a whole other

1563
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,280
talk couldn't it

1564
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,000
um just off the top of my head i would i

1565
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
would say

1566
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,440
better design that is not for

1567
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,319
by engineers for engineers that it

1568
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:43,680
should be a

1569
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,880
better user interface and all that yeah

1570
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,559
better design user interface and

1571
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,640
everything that takes into account

1572
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,760
um

1573
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,280
different personas of different users

1574
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,760
also

1575
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,280
the problem we always have is more

1576
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,040
reliable

1577
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,720
support

1578
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,240
and better

1579
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,520
open source

1580
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,079
well s-bombs are going to help some but

1581
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:10,559
most organizations still don't know what

1582
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:11,839
they're going to do with an s-bomb

1583
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:14,000
anyway so that's

1584
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,720
packaging those things up into

1585
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,520
is

1586
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,599
so that anyone can figure out is this

1587
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:21,920
good open source software for me to use

1588
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,000
how will i know when it needs updating

1589
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,480
if it does need fixing who do i go to

1590
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,280
and who can i rely on to fix it if i

1591
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,040
can't fix it myself

1592
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,240
and again

1593
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,640
bundling that all in a much

1594
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,720
more um consumer friendly

1595
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,680
um

1596
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,119
support system

1597
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:42,960
but that's that's just off the top of my

1598
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,480
head and i'm sure you have some thoughts

1599
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,480
as well

1600
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,559
thank you for for the input

1601
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:50,000
i think that the open source community

1602
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
will try to

1603
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
lower the cost of running all software

1604
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,520
for everyone

1605
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,559
yeah

1606
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,670
thank you

1607
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:01,839
[Applause]

1608
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:03,599
so it's funny that you mentioned s-bomb

1609
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:07,520
because alan friedman is here and and

1610
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,000
that brings to mind that this is a big

1611
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,599
hunk and problem that you're you're

1612
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:13,280
pointing out to us

1613
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,240
but the thing i want to observe is that

1614
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,720
five years ago i i amongst others were

1615
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,720
saying s-bomb's an impossibility we

1616
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,160
can't get there

1617
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,559
but the reality is we can and that's

1618
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:26,160
something that people need to also take

1619
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,400
from your talk that it's not

1620
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,160
just about

1621
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,839
what the problem is it's how do we get

1622
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:33,680
to that solution and it can be solved

1623
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,200
maybe not in a whole

1624
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,039
but unless we start working on it and

1625
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:38,880
and taking some of the ideas that you're

1626
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,720
putting forth we're never going to solve

1627
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:41,920
it and that's something that we really

1628
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,680
need to acknowledge

1629
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,200
yeah that's right and it and it goes

1630
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,280
from a well this would be really cool to

1631
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,520
do too i have a personal sense of

1632
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,039
obligation

1633
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:52,880
to do this not because it is going to

1634
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,720
get me more customers but because it's

1635
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,720
better for all of us

1636
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,520
and then maybe even to the point where

1637
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,640
in

1638
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:01,599
uh

1639
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:04,079
in countries where such a thing can

1640
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:06,160
safely be done to say look you know we

1641
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,839
have to pull together we're going to

1642
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:10,480
require everybody to do this

1643
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,520
um

1644
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,440
yeah that may not be the united states

1645
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,119
but i'm hoping somebody will step

1646
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:16,880
forward and lead

1647
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,200
ireland here you go

1648
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,119
you can do this

1649
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:22,160
okay

1650
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,160
so you talked about a lot of things that

1651
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,359
we could do

1652
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:27,119
um that large organizations or more

1653
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:29,039
experienced people could do to help

1654
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,480
victims can we also help address the

1655
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,680
issue

1656
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,319
by doing things towards the adversaries

1657
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:39,280
the way large companies say

1658
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,079
prosecute limited resources and such and

1659
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,839
so what can we do towards the

1660
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:46,000
adversaries not just what can we do for

1661
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,440
the victims

1662
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,960
yeah that's right and one of the things

1663
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,559
that i really liked that came out of the

1664
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:53,119
ransomware task force report last year

1665
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,440
was there was just as much emphasis on

1666
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,839
what do we do about the adversaries not

1667
01:03:57,839 --> 01:03:59,920
just how do we get a bigger stick to

1668
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,599
beat the victims

1669
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:03,119
so um

1670
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,559
and i just joined the steering committee

1671
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:07,599
for that task force so we are hoping to

1672
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:10,160
find more ways to help both from a

1673
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,520
defense side and from an actual

1674
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,280
prosecution side

1675
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,480
yeah

1676
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,520
this is

1677
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,839
a multi-faceted problem

1678
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:22,160
it's it's just as complex as climate

1679
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,240
change i think and there are just as

1680
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,960
many human foibles that are

1681
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,880
uh that we have to tackle in order to

1682
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,599
tackle the actual problem

1683
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:32,720
um

1684
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,799
but i'd like i i would hope that

1685
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:36,160
everyone would come away with this

1686
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,039

1739
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,319
in time of scoring as you can see we

1740
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:09,520
opened the ctf yesterday at 12 lunchtime

1741
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,240
it was 12 sharp a few minutes later some

1742
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,640
teams start to submitting the first

1743
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,960
flags and it was a heavy and intense day

1744
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,039
yesterday

1745
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:21,280
from this car we can see that we have a

1746
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,440
few teams three actually that managed to

1747
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,160
get all the flags right yesterday

1748
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,079
that are not competing for the the

1749
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:29,200
prizes

1750
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,559
all the team are actually very very

1751
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:32,480
close and even if you start today you

1752
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,480
still have a chance to reach to the top

1753
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,240
so i would suggest that if you did not

1754
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,920
start the ctf yet

1755
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,640
you can still do

1756
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,400
at nine today

1757
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,000
a bit later actually

1758
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,280
we have released a new batch of

1759
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,440
challenges so there are no more to play

1760
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,960
with and we'll continue to release new

1761
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,960
challenge tomorrow and on thursday as

1762
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,079

1763
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:52,960
uh

1764
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,799
we still have a few actually a hundred

1765
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:57,680
of those coins that we printed for

1766
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,760
eidenberg first conference so our plan

1767
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,760
is to give those that remains to the one

1768
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,599
that deserve one

1769
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:05,680
a few the first team was about in the

1770
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,079

1771
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:10,480

1772
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,240
so have a look on it it's just for fun

1773
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,160

1775
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:16,880
