1
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,559
[Music]

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,799
there we go threats versus capabilities

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,719
i'd rather have more of one than the

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,520
other and i guess our speaker is going

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,080
to help me decide which of which uh

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,960
thomas fisher has spoken at

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,800
well this is not your first first is it

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,920
that's my third that's your third first

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,039
and you've spoken at all of them eh

10
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,120
last three yeah well not the virtual

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,480
ones yeah

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,880
okay so anyway that's pretty good track

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,640
record um i've seen some of his talks

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,920
they're pretty good let's give him a

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,360
warm round of applause and i'm gonna get

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,840
the hell off stage

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,000
you thank you trey

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,160
well good afternoon everybody um hope

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,920
you had a good break got some coffee

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,320
still awake it's getting long it's good

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,600
been a long day for everybody

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,879
okay so i'm not going to go over who i

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,960
am you can read it in the booklet but

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,320
one of the things i'm going to say is

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,159
that if you've been to my previous talks

26
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,320
you know that i try to challenge the way

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,360
we think

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,360
but i'm not really presenting a solution

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,600
a solution or anything like that i want

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,760
to present something that i've done what

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,600
i've been involved in that'll help you

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,200
challenge the way that you think and

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,799
help you challenge the way that you you

34
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,000
do things

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,880
uh and think differently so let's see

36
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,400
why are we here

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,479
well let's face it

38
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,240
despite all the hard work we do in

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,320
insert response and detection

40
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,240
engineering and and everything that you

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,560
do to protect your environments

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,159
for actors are still there they're still

43
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,200
getting in

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,799
so i was sitting around and i was like

45
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,200
so why are we still in this situation

46
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,520
that was i started to think about how am

47
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,960
i going to ensure that we protect

48
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,560
ourselves and we're not getting these

49
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,079
we're not in the same situation all the

50
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,119
time

51
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,920
so i started looking at people

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,560
i don't think people are the problem the

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,719
previous speaker mentioned it we should

54
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,640
be able to mentor people we should be

55
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,719
able to bring new talent into the field

56
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,719
we should be able to grow ourselves in

57
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,640
the field so people shouldn't be the

58
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,960
problem and if people are the problem

59
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,119
we're probably doing something wrong in

60
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,878
terms of mentoring in terms of training

61
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,879
people in terms of getting people on

62
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,080
board

63
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,520
procedures

64
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,000
um this is really a business thing right

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,319
or drive to where how do you do things

66
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,760
and things like that you can always

67
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,680
change those if those aren't working for

68
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
you change them i mean it's simple it's

69
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,840
a procedure it's a written document if

70
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,360
they are static and they're not living

71
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,519
in your environment then

72
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,200
again you need to rethink how you're

73
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,319
doing your procedures and what you're

74
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,480
doing with procedures

75
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,440
technology so this is the one that we

76
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,440
always kind of end up blaming if you

77
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,280
think about it you're always blaming

78
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,879
technology to a certain extent you're

79
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,280
saying oh this tool is failing or i

80
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,720
don't have these capabilities in this

81
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,560
tool so i can't do this i can't do that

82
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,879
so one day

83
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,480
actually at a recent meeting i was at

84
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,080
this quote came up

85
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,640
this is from buck mr fuller on his

86
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,879
thesis on uh i think it's called

87
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,680
starship earth or mothership earth

88
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,400
and in this he says that basically what

89
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,840
he's saying is the failures are the

90
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,159
consequences of a number of things but

91
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,519
more importantly

92
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,920
that if we specialize too much in our

93
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,200
fields and if we put too much

94
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,840
specialization in we're going to

95
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,239
we're going to fail but and we need more

96
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,760
comprehensive thinking we need to be

97
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,319
able to have multiple talents multiple

98
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,319
abilities and we need to be able to

99
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,319
think differently to a certain extent

100
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,840
and if you think about it you've seen

101
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,120
this in in certain sci-fi movies where

102
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,599
people go to say like mars but it's only

103
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,920
tech it's only like really phd people

104
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,120
and and

105
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,760
and scientists but who's going to build

106
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,360
who's going to do the grunt work if you

107
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,720
only have smart people who does the

108
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,680
grunt work

109
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,599
and that's kind of the the premise of

110
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,840
some of the some of his work and i was

111
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,519
sitting here going

112
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,439
this was being explained to me in a

113
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,360
meeting and i was like satan wait a

114
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,799
minute if i change

115
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,040
oh crap

116
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,200
the slide didn't work out that security

117
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,519
is supposed to point over society

118
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,519
so if you see society's crossed out i

119
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,680
put security in its place

120
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,560
and then if i put tools in place of

121
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,238
specialization

122
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,759
i've now

123
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,040
got

124
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,960
something that applies

125
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,720
to security to a certain extent

126
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,800
are we relying too much on our tools to

127
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,960
be able to do our jobs are we relying

128
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,479
too much on the things that the tools

129
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,320
that are being presented to us as a

130
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,840
solution to what we what we're trying to

131
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,440
do

132
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,520
and this is where i was like

133
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,520
okay

134
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,479
this is a good starting point

135
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,400
you know we always blame tools for not

136
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,360
being able to do what they're supposed

137
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,400
to be doing

138
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,520
um i've been in a number of

139
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,040
conversations the past few weeks where

140
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,000
tools of

141
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,440
the tool vendors are really starting to

142
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,120
get on my nerves

143
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,400
and then

144
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,600
you get this

145
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,240
i found this infographic from

146
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,960
from

147
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,360
scrutiny i think it's really good

148
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,880
because it kind of describes our

149
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,880
environment right now if you're an if

150
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,400
you're a slot if you're part of a soccer

151
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,320
if you're part of a response team and if

152
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,479
you're trying to get into

153
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,479
like understanding what's going on with

154
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,000
with all the things that are on the

155
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,400
market there's so much stuff and there's

156
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,160
so many different directions people are

157
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,840
telling you pushing you to and then

158
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,360
there's xdr right the new thing is xdr i

159
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,160
actually saw i think out of rsa somebody

160
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,080
called somebody said there was an xgr

161
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,039
next gen it's like what the

162
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,720
i mean come on guys it's like stop

163
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,240
inventing words it's still the same

164
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,800
bloody stuff it's still a tool that's

165
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,880
detecting events but presenting the

166
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,360
events to you in a readable format it's

167
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,080
like stop putting labels on things

168
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,080
please please stop putting labels on

169
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,960
things

170
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,400
but and when we talk about labeling

171
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,000
we start to think about

172
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,759
well why is late why are labels so

173
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,919
important but it's not important that's

174
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,560
my problem it's not important

175
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,800
we need to start go back to some basic

176
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,319
principles

177
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,160
what products should the organization

178
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
purchase

179
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,720
i out of curiosity what do you think

180
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,240
anybody from the audience want to take a

181
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,280
guess shout out

182
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,120
no so we got av firewall up front now

183
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,160
what matters to your organization

184
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,520
right

185
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,120
this is the problem is we're buying

186
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,120
tools because we're being pushed by

187
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,880
vendors sometimes we're being pushed by

188
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,400
our own management that says oh you need

189
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,680
to look at this new tool it's really

190
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,720
cool i saw it at rsa or whatever and

191
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,800
it's really important and we need to get

192
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,360
that tool on board it's like no step

193
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,240
back

194
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,440
what actually matters to your

195
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,360
organization what is going to help you

196
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,600
solve your problems

197
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,120
a lot of vendors will come and pitch to

198
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,960
you and say oh i have this new solution

199
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,479
for you

200
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,960
i basically now tell vendors to leave if

201
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,639
they tell me i have they have a solution

202
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,080
for me they don't know what my problem

203
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,240
is they have a product they have a tool

204
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,039
that might help me fix my solution

205
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,960
will build my solution but they do not

206
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
know what my solution is and i recommend

207
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,479
you actually challenge any vendor that

208
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,680
comes in i'm sorry if there are any

209
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,280
vendors in the crowd

210
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,960
but you guys need to wake up because you

211
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,960
cancel you can't present a solution to a

212
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,160
problem that you don't know how to fit

213
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,199
but you don't know what i have

214
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,560
so

215
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,400
then

216
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,160
mitre

217
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,360
mitre was really great when it started i

218
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,400
really liked it it was simple we had we

219
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,360
had ttps you know we had the techniques

220
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,919
and we could easily identify and

221
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,160
correlate and basically categorize

222
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,440
attacks

223
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,560
in a

224
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,800
understandable and readable way

225
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,120
then vendors got involved

226
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,919
and mida became the bane of my existence

227
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,319
because nowadays it's like oh we do the

228
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,160
vendors are like oh yes we detect all of

229
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,199
these minor attack ttps we can classify

230
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,680
all your events as a ttp i was like no

231
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,000
stop stop i don't care it's like i'm not

232
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,919
going to use that to do detection and i

233
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,919
was really happy when i was in the i was

234
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,360
i was watching the

235
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,520
the presentation yesterday on the

236
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,280
analytics that they did on the t on the

237
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,560
tactics

238
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,319
and they actually said

239
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,000
the people for mira

240
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,599
uh and i'm gonna find that i'm gonna

241
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,039
rewatch the video and get the exact

242
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,560
quote but they basically explained that

243
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,400
you cannot do detections with techniques

244
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,800
and please remember that if that if

245
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,319
you're going to look at detection

246
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,280
technology don't focus on does it do

247
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,479
mitre because it doesn't really matter

248
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,519
because

249
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,640
um

250
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,479
you you you start

251
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,240
you end up having tools that will tell

252
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,279
you that

253
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,519
a simple

254
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,440
lullaby everybody know what a lol bus is

255
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
living on the land binaries right

256
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,720
but a low bus is a malware

257
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,880
i've actually seen that i've been in

258
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,320
arguments with three weeks with one

259
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,480
vendor because they are detecting simple

260
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,320
software and they're classifying them as

261
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,760
a v as as like their advanced av

262
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,920
solution is classifying them as malware

263
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,600
and my guess but they won't tell me but

264
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,120
my guess is only because it appears in

265
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,720
certain ttps

266
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,800
in maya because that's the only reason

267
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,320
they would actually flag it as bad

268
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,640
then

269
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,120
it's become a little bit too focused on

270
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,200
threat actors

271
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,320
right and there's a lot of and i don't

272
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,880
necessarily disagree with it with that

273
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,880
what my problem is it's being used

274
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,240
primarily in

275
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,880
the evaluation basis and it's being used

276
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,399
as

277
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,519
a reasoning for a product to kind of

278
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,399
like be the best solution for you right

279
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,880
um or the best tool for you

280
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,839
and that's fine but you don't know what

281
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,800
the unknown unknowns are my problem is

282
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,720
like in this in that list there's

283
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,680
probably

284
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,480
my organization that's probably only one

285
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,959
actor that i'm really concerned with

286
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,000
but there's a whole bunch of other

287
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,279
actors that i'm concerned with that are

288
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,680
not in this list and potentially not in

289
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,360
the really properly defined in the mitre

290
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,040
attack framework

291
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,160
so detection is showing the techniques

292
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,519
or procedures

293
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,040
well actually is i should have

294
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,720
questioned would that phrase that in a

295
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,640
question but is it really showing a

296
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,079
detection when you're looking at

297
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,560
techniques and procedures no a detection

298
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,800
for me is a set of events so you're

299
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,399
gonna have a set of techniques you

300
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,040
probably could potentially have as a

301
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,959
full procedure before you actually get a

302
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,800
detection

303
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,440
so you cover a bunch of ttps but as many

304
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,040
people have done presentations and minus

305
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,880
that what about the unknown unknowns

306
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,600
right until somebody tells midair that

307
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,279
oh you need to put this into the attack

308
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,399
framework

309
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,839
you don't know what the unknown unknowns

310
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,360
are

311
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,399
how are you going to detect them if

312
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,480
you're focused on all on tact on tactics

313
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,320
uh jared atkinson

314
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,800
wrote uh put this up on twitter

315
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,920
in april

316
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,760
um the link is there it'll be in the pdf

317
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,839
or you can download afterwards but one

318
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,200
of the interesting things is it's like

319
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,959
and i was like when you publish this i

320
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,480
was like yes somebody who actually

321
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,800
understands what my problem is kind of

322
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,959
thing it's

323
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,560
he's highlighting here that in an attack

324
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,839
there are a lot of techniques that are

325
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,880
used

326
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,839
but each technique lives in a flow

327
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,839
of during an attack

328
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:18,720
but

329
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,360
many unique paths exist

330
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,720
from the poi from the start of the

331
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,399
attack to when they compromise your

332
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,440
environment or when they're actively

333
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,519
moving around in your environment and

334
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,680
that's the problem is that we don't have

335
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
when you're looking at things like in in

336
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,360
such a structured way

337
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,040
you're kind of losing the visibility

338
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,480
that you should be looking at which is

339
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,800
having a white much wider visibility and

340
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,560
looking at events and processing the

341
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,800
events based on your environment

342
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,760
and that's something that um if you if

343
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,519
you go into fret hunting

344
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,519
um i think joe this morning said it in

345
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,959
his front handling presentation he

346
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,399
basically said it's like you have to

347
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,839
kind of understand your environment if

348
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,440
you're going to do fret hunting properly

349
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,720
and you have to completely you're going

350
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
to have to feed that loop continuously

351
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,519
to be able to understand that

352
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,120
so

353
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,880
what can we do differently so my so i

354
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,720
sit in that guy and say so what really

355
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,440
is my problem and my problem is is like

356
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,880
and i've done this a number of times

357
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,120
even before i was i was with my current

358
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,279
company as i was sitting there going

359
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,519
it's like if i'm going into if i'm going

360
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,639
to look at these things i'm going to

361
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,959
rebuild a soccer i'm going to rebuild

362
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,200
an ir team or i'm going to rebuild our

363
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,120
capabilities to do detection it's like

364
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,040
what's my real problem my real problem

365
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,279
is i don't really understand what my

366
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,360
current capabilities are or what i

367
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,200
really need to focus on

368
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,839
and that's

369
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,519
where the challenge is and that's where

370
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,920
i want to kind of try and solve this and

371
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,000
that this is where i wanted to push new

372
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,600
thinking

373
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,519
so i started thinking well threat

374
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,120
modeling right we do fret one everybody

375
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,000
does threat modding when they're

376
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,120
deploying applications when they're

377
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,959
deploying infrastructure right

378
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,000
right

379
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,279
no

380
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,760
exactly

381
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,000
threat modeling works

382
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,360
is nice

383
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,680
but it's also complicated to do takes a

384
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,839
lot of time

385
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,600
sometimes and typically it's focused on

386
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,120
the application

387
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,120
and the infrastructure the application

388
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,480
the other problem i have with it too is

389
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,680
that it's

390
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,880
can tend to be focused on risk

391
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,560
rather than

392
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,320
rather than what am i going to actually

393
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,720
protect my environment against

394
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,440
so it's very much a risk-based approach

395
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,560
risks

396
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,320
are nice

397
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,600
but

398
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,519
have you ever tried to actually map a

399
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,320
risk into detections

400
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,079
it's like let's take take a car an

401
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,320
energy right we know there's a risk of

402
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,560
driving out into

403
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,120
into into the street and that you might

404
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,560
something might happen right so we

405
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,240
prepare ourselves right this is risk

406
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,480
mitigation you put seat belts on you

407
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,199
drive slowly you have airbags you make

408
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,880
sure everybody's seated and things like

409
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,760
that but what's the threat the threat is

410
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,519
somebody running into you

411
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,120
the threat is that there's an external

412
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,800
event that happens and you get and you

413
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,199
have a car accident that's not a risk

414
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,800
right the ri

415
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,480
that's

416
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,320
that's i didn't mean to say that that's

417
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,279
not exactly what i meant

418
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,199
the threat

419
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,040
is what is

420
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,839
what's going to happen

421
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,800
now i lost the train my foot

422
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,959
i need to reboot back up

423
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,440
no i need to reboot my brain

424
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,760
sorry but sorry everybody so

425
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,920
i'm saying so

426
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,680
when we're in the car so somebody's

427
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,880
going to crash into you that's the

428
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,560
threat right somebody might crash

429
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,760
somebody's crashing into you that's the

430
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,440
threat now you've prepared and you

431
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,040
mitigated a risk

432
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,880
which is how much damage you can do to

433
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,480
your environment to yourself or to the

434
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,320
people in your car right

435
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,760
by putting in the seat belts by putting

436
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,680
in the airbags but the fret is still

437
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,720
there

438
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,079
it's like how am i going to detect that

439
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,040
threat

440
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,959
and if you think about some of the

441
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,279
recent stories with the tesla cars and

442
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,399
things like that

443
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,079
on the order drive

444
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,760
they basically are continuously

445
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,279
monitoring the road in front of them to

446
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,440
look for potential threats

447
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,440
right so they're going to stop

448
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,720
all their drive when they hit a

449
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,079
potential when they see a potential

450
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,360
threat

451
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,560
and

452
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,760
this is where

453
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,839
kind of like the thinking process is

454
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,120
well

455
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,720
i'm not going to really be you know

456
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,199
whatever i put into terms of detections

457
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,959
yes it's going to gain my risk but it's

458
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,320
not really what i'm looking for i'm not

459
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,720
really looking to detect my risks

460
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,399
my risks are that my company gets

461
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,920
compromised but how does it get

462
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
compromised i want to protect myself

463
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,120
against how it's going to be compromised

464
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,920
and i didn't i don't for me i mean you

465
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,079
can argue this with me afterwards we

466
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,560
can't spend that but i don't see risk as

467
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,399
a good way to

468
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,639
do incident response right it's a

469
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,079
response we're responding to a threat

470
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,839
responding to a threat actor trying to

471
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,680
break into our environment responding to

472
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,120
specific events

473
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,240
and when i'm looking at detection

474
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,680
engineering

475
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,199
i'm not really going to

476
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,040
engineer a detection

477
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,720
for a risk i'm going to engineer a

478
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,480
detection for a threat

479
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,160
right that's why we talk about threat

480
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,920
actors that's why we talk about mitre

481
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,680
talks about the about threat actors as

482
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,720
well

483
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,560
and those ctps

484
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,800
so

485
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,240
i'm so my focus was

486
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,399
that i wanted to a practical approach a

487
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,040
practical approach based on what i can

488
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,120
actually detect but also what i want to

489
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,040
protect the organization against

490
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,639
so you know like

491
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,720
a fret actor coming into my environment

492
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,440
uh

493
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
some ransomware attacks

494
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,720
potentially

495
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,040
uh some idiot that's doing that's trying

496
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,880
to fish me right

497
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,959
some things like that those are real

498
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,560
real threats right against my

499
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,279
organization

500
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,360
so

501
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,480
i wanted

502
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
to build

503
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,560
a way to identify this through a threat

504
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,759
driven approach

505
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,120
so this is where the fret versus

506
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,560
capabilities comes in so i'm going to

507
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,240
start with a fret and then i'm going to

508
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
look at mapping my capabilities so i

509
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,240
want to understand my capabilities as it

510
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,680
applies to how i'm going to protect

511
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,039
myself against the threat

512
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,240
it's going to have i need it needs to

513
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,480
help me define what and how detection is

514
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,079
achieved

515
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,400
and i want it also eventually to

516
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,160
identify how effective my response is

517
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,119
going to be

518
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,520
right so if i know what i can detect i

519
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,640
can i know basically i can start setting

520
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,079
the foundation of how effective my

521
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,319
response is going to be

522
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,319
so the premise of this is

523
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,760
i'm going to first

524
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,520
work to understand what the what threats

525
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,960
my organizations are concerned is

526
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,799
concerned with so i'm going to look at

527
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,720
all the different frets

528
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,919
you can use

529
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,919
any fret mappings that you want you can

530
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,960
use enazar you can use

531
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,280
what's the verizons and things like that

532
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,760
all those reports but i'm going to focus

533
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,440
on the ones that are priority for me for

534
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,200
my organization

535
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,120
probably talk to my cso probably talk to

536
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,880
my security

537
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,039
director of security and say okay so

538
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,640
what are we really concerned with here

539
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,559
what's our biggest threat we know what

540
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,360
some of our biggest threats are

541
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,120
then i want to identify the assets this

542
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,080
is one

543
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,280
phase

544
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,000
that i think we overlook for overlook a

545
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,600
lot as incident responders and as

546
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,480
uh

547
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,320
as sock analysts and things like that

548
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,000
and it was even mentioned earl in the

549
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,160
previous presentation on the cloud ir

550
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,440
it's like if you don't understand your

551
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,039
assets in the cloud

552
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,640
you're going to have a really hard time

553
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,240
time doing ir

554
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,640
um i'm i can't go into what but our

555
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,240
cloud environment is so bloody humongous

556
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,000
i don't even know how we can do it right

557
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,360
now right

558
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,600
we're working on it but you know

559
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,120
you need to determine the detection data

560
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,160
points

561
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,240
so

562
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,520
we know

563
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,679
how to fight these threats we know how

564
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,400
to

565
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,880
how to control mitigate contain

566
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,520
eradicate these threats so

567
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,880
we

568
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,520
can understand what our detection points

569
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,760
are we don't need a tool to basically

570
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,120
tell us oh we need to detect this this

571
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,360
and that if you understand how to how to

572
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,440
basically identify a threat

573
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,200
based on your experience based on your

574
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,640
knowledge based on sharing with other

575
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,640
people you can start to identify the

576
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,039
data points which you want to detect

577
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,039
from those data points you can start to

578
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,720
build response actions and use those

579
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,000
data points to build your response

580
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,400
actions

581
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:16,640
so

582
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,799
like i said we start with a threat i

583
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,720
just picked this up from the inn is a

584
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,080
that's it this is a 2021 fret

585
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,440
infographic that they use for the threat

586
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,840
for their fret landscape for 2021

587
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,080
but it's got crypto jacking threats

588
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,000
against data malware disinformation

589
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,919
misinformation non-malicious threats

590
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,240
friends against availability ransomware

591
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,080
email related threads supply chain

592
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,280
threats

593
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,120
um i would actually

594
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,760
focus on the more very specific threats

595
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,640
like ransomware malware threats against

596
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,240
my data i'll even go a little bit

597
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,840
further into threats against my data so

598
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,080
if i'm in a european institute i would

599
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,840
probably look at oh

600
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,520
can somebody change the data without me

601
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,480
knowing

602
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,160
so very specific threats like that you

603
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,840
want to go down to the specific level of

604
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,360
threat because that's going to help you

605
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,720
actually better understand what data

606
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,120
points you need

607
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,840
so my approach

608
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,080
and this is an approach

609
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,600
it's a framework

610
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,120
you can build on it you can use it you

611
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,760
can change it you can ignore it i don't

612
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,400
it's i'm here to present a way

613
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,760
for you to start thinking a bit

614
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,600
differently that's my goal

615
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,919
i'm not saying this is the this is the

616
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,760
best thing you can do but i use a mind

617
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,440
map i like mind maps

618
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,840
actually drawing it out helped

619
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,640
me and actually the team a lot to better

620
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,799
understand what things that we needed

621
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,360
and where we needed to put them

622
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,039
and i started with i started with

623
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,720
another framework which is the nist

624
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,480
incident response framework because it

625
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,080
had three components of what i thought

626
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,360
was important

627
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,840
for us to do instant response but for us

628
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,440
also to do

629
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,280
detection engineering

630
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,520
and that was the identification phase

631
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,919
the detect phase and response phase

632
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,679
and specifically the identification

633
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,440
phase i wanted to do

634
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,360
i looked at asset management

635
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,120
because again this is something that we

636
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,880
overlook a lot and we need to understand

637
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,799
when we're doing a certain response for

638
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,159
a start

639
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,919
but it's also very helpful when you're

640
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,280
doing detection because if you

641
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,120
understand what assets you have

642
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,559
you can basically put your detections in

643
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,200
the right place

644
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,159
so i use the my map primarily as a

645
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,520
reference graph

646
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,720
so it's going to be it's going to build

647
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,039
basically an identification of all the

648
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,679
things that i need

649
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,000
it starts with the base at the base we

650
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,159
have the threat but it starts with three

651
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,919
key domains which is identify asset

652
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,039
management detect and respond

653
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,200
and you can quickly use that graph to

654
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,799
basically identify where your telemetry

655
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,039
goes and what information and what

656
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,039
activities you want to

657
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,880
include in your environment in your

658
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,280
systems

659
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,880
so

660
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,559
fret

661
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,640
is the central pivot point

662
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,520
so for example ransomware

663
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,960
so first i'm going to build on my

664
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,280
identify so i'm going to look at what

665
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,080
assets do i am i concerned with what

666
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,440
information do i have on all those

667
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,640
assets

668
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,400
and then going to look at the text so i

669
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,240
know what i need to detect ransomware

670
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,760
right it could come from a phishing

671
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,919
email it could come from a download so i

672
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,000
know i need to focus on how to detect

673
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,400
phishing and email i also need to detect

674
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,000
maybe process launch

675
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,480
maybe file manipulations so things like

676
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,640
that so i know there's probably maybe a

677
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,400
callback because there's a rat in there

678
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,000
somewhere

679
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,280
so all these things are going to

680
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,639
determine what i need to detect

681
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,760
response is what i need to have to be

682
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,760
able to respond it's not the actual

683
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,600
actions of responses

684
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,039
i know what my actions are right i'm

685
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:47,919
going to

686
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,840
look at the data i'm going to start kill

687
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,600
processes i'm probably potentially going

688
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,280
to contain certain machines and things

689
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,400
like that but i need to understand what

690
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,080
will give me that telemetry to be able

691
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,480
to execute those actions what functions

692
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,159
do i need to be able to execute those

693
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,480
actions

694
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,280
so start to build it up

695
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,039
so on the identify

696
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,480
i start looking at the endpoints i start

697
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,760
looking at network i start looking at

698
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
the user accounts people

699
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,440
on the detect i

700
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,880
can look at a little bit of the types of

701
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,919
tools that i want i can look at the

702
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,919
telemetry that i want on the response

703
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,039
i'm going to look at the types tools

704
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,559
that i need for response i'm going to

705
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,760
look at the types of mitigations and

706
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,600
mediations that i want to put into play

707
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,280
and i'm going to look at the analysis

708
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,840
that i need to have to be able to do

709
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,520
those mitigations and remediations but

710
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,039
also to be able to report to be able to

711
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,720
identify to be able to do forensics work

712
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,480
then i'm going to go deeper so end

713
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,039
points hopefully i have a cmdb

714
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,480
hopefully

715
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,600
how many of you guys have got a real

716
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,679
cmdb in your environments

717
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:48,720
hands up

718
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,200
a few you're lucky are you sure it's

719
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,440
right

720
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,919
i'm looking for network and look at my

721
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,400
ip assignments if you have a really big

722
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
network if you're working in the cloud

723
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,960
and you have multiple cloud accounts

724
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,200
you're going to have a crap load of

725
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,440
networks

726
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,480
and they

727
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,799
hopefully are not overlapped but

728
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,480
if you've got a good network engineers

729
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,960
it won't be overlapped but sometimes you

730
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,559
know

731
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,159
for the detection i'm going to start

732
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,360
with the tool so i'm going to look at

733
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,200
the types of tools that i want not the

734
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,120
actual tool so i'm not going to identify

735
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,720
a specific vendor tool i'm going to look

736
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,960
at the type of tool so for example i

737
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,600
want maybe something like an edr

738
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,760
right i want something maybe like a

739
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,559
uh

740
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,159
network

741
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,440
detection

742
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,120
i want maybe something like pcap

743
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,720
detection

744
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,559
telemetry i'm going to look at the

745
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,400
endpoint what endpoints limit you do i

746
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,240
need process execution file

747
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,600
manipulations

748
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
dll registry

749
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,520
that kind of stuff

750
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,279
temperature on the network i'm going to

751
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,159
look at

752
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,159
callbacks ips ports

753
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,120
potentially if it's clear text some data

754
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,720
from that clear text

755
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,760
on the response side on that analysis

756
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,360
i'm actually going to be able to if i do

757
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,520
it right i'm going to be able to pull

758
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,200
the the data that i'm putting up in the

759
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,039
telemetry a lot of it's going to map

760
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,799
back into my event data

761
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,279
so i'm building that link between the

762
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,080
detection and then my analysis

763
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,000
then i can use correlation to get

764
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,640
additional data to improve my my

765
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,840
understanding of the data that i'm

766
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,320
seeing to improve my visibility then i'm

767
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,000
going to specify the actions that i'm

768
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,120
going to put under mitigation

769
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,400
remediation

770
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,480
and then i'm going to specify the tools

771
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,600
types

772
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,600
so we keep going down keep going down so

773
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,720
i'm going to have data points i'm going

774
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,559
to have data points are linked to tools

775
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,000
and data points are linked between

776
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,360
phases

777
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,799
and we keep going

778
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,080
and you get to this

779
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,159
so this is this will be inside in the

780
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,240
pdf so you'll be able to zoom in

781
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,960
but

782
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,799
it's a big mess right

783
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,240
yeah because you need a lot of things to

784
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,600
do your detection you need of other

785
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,640
things to do

786
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,159
your your

787
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,559
your mitigations and your remediations

788
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,320
so if i look if we can zoom in a little

789
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:04,880
bit

790
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,400
[Music]

791
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,200
we can zoom in a little bit thank you

792
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,640
so this is like for example what we're

793
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,799
looking at for process info so the

794
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,200
context i.e username command line

795
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
arguments maybe the modules that it's

796
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,120
loading name the reg registry

797
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,679
modifications the path the id the start

798
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:22,799
time

799
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,039
we can pull fire hashes is it a parent

800
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,120
or a child of or both

801
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,600
the network connections so i'm

802
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,279
basically looking at these data points

803
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,720
these are the data points that i want to

804
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,400
use to be able to build my detections

805
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,120
and similarly for

806
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,039
when i'm looking during my response the

807
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,320
event data

808
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,919
so i'm going to look for is this on a

809
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,320
corporate network or you know nowadays

810
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,640
half of my maybe more than half of our

811
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,360
users are off network right they're

812
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,600
vpn into the corporate environment

813
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,880
because they're working from home

814
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,559
they're still working from home

815
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,320
so is it on a corporate network if it's

816
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
not how do i handle that networking

817
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,480
first source port destination port then

818
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,320
i can add dns information maybe i can

819
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,679
add

820
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,799
you know dns the time the time the

821
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,919
ttl of that dns name things like that

822
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,880
uh on the ttps i can start to look at

823
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,559
do i have community shared information

824
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,720
about some of the some of the detections

825
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
that i've detection data points that i

826
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,000
have

827
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,840
things like that so this is going to

828
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,320
this builds up

829
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,039
so

830
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,600
what do i do with this well it's nice to

831
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,120
have a graphic right

832
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,799
but at the end of the day how am i going

833
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,799
to use this graphic well

834
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,720
i'm going to build a requirements

835
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,799
i.e a reference manual

836
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,640
so this is going to be a list everything

837
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,399
that i just documented in my diagram and

838
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,159
i'm going to put it out into a list

839
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,360
it's going to immature all the data

840
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,279
points that i need

841
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,679
for that specific risk

842
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,600
it'll help identify which data points

843
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,840
have a different stage helps to map my

844
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,120
requirements to identifying and

845
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,960
selecting the tools

846
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,559
provides the requirements when building

847
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,039
a solution or element of the solution so

848
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,880
i'm essentially building a requirements

849
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,039
document from the ground up provides a

850
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,720
method to establish a gap analysis and

851
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,480
this is where this was the important

852
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,559
part that i wanted to focus on is the

853
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,159
gap analysis i have a bunch of tools

854
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,600
already i have a bunch of stuff that's

855
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,840
working what is actually missing what do

856
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,919
i need to add to make my environment

857
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,919
better more secure

858
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,840
as much as i can be

859
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,120
so

860
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,600
i went cheap i basically use this uh

861
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,360
spreadsheet google sheet

862
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,960
so you see

863
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,679
i determined that there's a provided by

864
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,480
and used by column so provided by would

865
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,200
be

866
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,960
what element of my environment

867
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,120
environment provides this information

868
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,440
used by is what is

869
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,399
who uses this data point you fill in the

870
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,679
columns based on the availability and

871
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,240
use of the data points and you from your

872
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
diagram blank gaps are where you need to

873
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,480
address your problems so provided us

874
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,320
tells us where the information comes

875
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,159
from can be multiple sources you could

876
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,640
have carbon black you can have av you

877
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,000
can have a whole bunch of other sources

878
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
that are providing you that telemetry

879
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,919
you populate with the source tools and

880
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,559
apps that provide that data and the data

881
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,120
you know we can look at it from multiple

882
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,039
ways

883
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,880
the use by tells us who is actually

884
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,120
using this data so for example it could

885
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,840
be a detection could be a detection my

886
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,320
edr could be a detection in my sim could

887
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,159
be a it could be used part of my

888
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,840
incident ticket but i put into my

889
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,760
service now incident ticket or it could

890
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,840
be used by the sword to be able to do

891
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,360
to do enrichment

892
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,039
and then so this is kind of see how we

893
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,120
got some start to get some examples so

894
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,039
here i've put in so this is the process

895
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,039
info i put in the you know like we're

896
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,320
using an epp and edi i avoided names um

897
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,799
at the time because i figured

898
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,799
maybe we start with just the concept of

899
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,159
the tool before we start with the actual

900
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,399
tool

901
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,559
so and it starts to build up

902
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,720
and you can see like in this example we

903
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,960
have a few

904
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,279
empty spots here so some of this stuff

905
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,640
isn't being detected some of this stuff

906
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,000
isn't being used

907
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,200
right so

908
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,360
then i can see i can go back and say oh

909
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,880
do we need to actually use this should i

910
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,399
be using this

911
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,159
do i actually need this

912
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,120
what what can i do with it right

913
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,120
and we carry on

914
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,919
down the down the list

915
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,679
so what did this provide well it

916
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,200
provided a good understanding of my own

917
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,039
of the organization's capabilities what

918
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,520
can we do what are we able to detect how

919
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,440
are we able to respond

920
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,799
to that threat

921
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,039
it's helping us make focus making good

922
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,679
decisions on on our tooling right so

923
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,760
we're actually looking at improving our

924
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,360
tooling so we know which direction we

925
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,600
need to go we know we need to do and put

926
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,919
in the backlog to improve our tooling

927
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:44,799
and

928
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,679
it's a framework to poc a new tool

929
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,880
to be honest

930
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,399
now that i know what i need

931
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,559
i now have that framework to poc i can

932
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,320
start pocking tools and checking off the

933
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,840
boxes

934
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,679
cool

935
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,799
that's it

936
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,279
gives us five minutes for questions

937
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,840
according to the clock

938
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:14,599
[Applause]

939
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,799
we may be tired for different reasons

940
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,559
but this talk

941
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,919
i didn't feel like i was going to fall

942
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,880
asleep for one second so that's

943
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,559
meant as a compliment you got some

944
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,159
questions out here are some comments

945
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,640
disguised as questions statements you

946
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,200
can argue with me i don't mind i this is

947
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
arguments get two this is this is one

948
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,720
this is a this is an opinion that i'm

949
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,159
projecting

950
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,679
i could be wrong

951
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,000
you you guys have your own opinions you

952
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,279
have your own ways of doing things and

953
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,760
i'm happy to discuss and argue argue

954
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,760
with it but not maybe not a full

955
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,679
argument but get contradiction the the

956
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,039
person up there was oh thank you thank

957
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,240
you

958
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,320
uh thanks for the talk i i really enjoy

959
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,080
uh

960
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,679
i don't know figuring out different ways

961
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,679
to do things or i don't know thinking

962
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,799
differently yeah thinking differently um

963
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,240
i'm eric julian from octa uh just a

964
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,159
quick question on

965
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,640
i guess i'm not even sure how to uh

966
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,279
maybe phrase this but so in and come up

967
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,360
with the the threats and the risks in

968
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,320
the in the middle of the um the mind map

969
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,039
how specific do you get with the threats

970
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,840
because in some ways like if it's

971
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,720
you know

972
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,159
i don't know if it's going after a

973
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,559
workstation does it like do i really

974
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,399
care if it's third actor x or threat

975
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,440
actor y

976
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,799
if it's trying to put some malware on

977
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,399
there like or do you just kind of keep

978
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,720
it more generic keep it more generic

979
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,559
i'm not specifically focused on the

980
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,480
actors because if you you know one good

981
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,000
thing with one of the good things about

982
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,440
if you actually go back and look at the

983
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,360
minor mappings and the fret actors

984
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,279
there's so much overlap but you're more

985
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,440
concerned with the actual mechanism of

986
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,919
the fret rather than the actor

987
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,480
right does that make sense so you you're

988
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,640
more focused on the ransomware part or

989
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,960
the remote access tool that they're

990
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,640
putting in you know that they're getting

991
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,919
into your environment because they sent

992
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,519
you a phishing link and your user

993
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,480
downloaded it back at any desk and we

994
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,080
launched it right

995
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,799
yeah cool thanks

996
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,240
so hi chris strosti i work for tufts

997
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,919
medicine out of boston um i wanted to

998
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,080
sort of pick your brain one of the

999
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,320
slides you had up uh was about threat

1000
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,960
modeling you said that it's hard to do

1001
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,919
which i agree um but i think that it's

1002
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:28,960
one of the

1003
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,640
more useful things one of the more

1004
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,480
useful exercises maybe other than a

1005
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,799
tabletop that we can do

1006
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,799
um do you have any ideas about how to

1007
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,120
make it easier or why it's so hard

1008
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,480
so

1009
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,720
why it's so hard my experience has been

1010
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,840
that basically

1011
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,080
when you talk to developers or the

1012
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,000
solutions architects you're talking in

1013
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,760
vague concepts for them

1014
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,919
right unless you and that's the security

1015
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:58,799
aware

1016
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,480
a lot of times it's a vague concept oh

1017
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,399
like oh you mean you there's a risk okay

1018
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,720
but what does that actually mean

1019
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,440
right so um you know there's a really oh

1020
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,520
they might get into my data so like this

1021
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,800
is my data it's like how they're going

1022
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,280
to get into my data kind of thing right

1023
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,239
so

1024
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,560
visualizing that conceptually

1025
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,079
it's sometimes it's hard for developers

1026
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,760
to actually do

1027
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,719
my

1028
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,719
bigger issue is that a lot of this stuff

1029
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,440
is very focused on that risk aspect

1030
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,760
where you know like oh my date i need to

1031
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,000
protect my data from the potential that

1032
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,839
somebody's going to get into my data but

1033
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,679
and then we say oh we've got mitigations

1034
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,359
we can put into play

1035
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,280
but we're not we're only at really

1036
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,119
identifying the mitigations at least

1037
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,199
this is my experience right and

1038
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,719
my experience has been mitigations are

1039
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,918
identified

1040
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,359
but we don't actually go that step

1041
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,040
further and say okay what am i going to

1042
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,359
need to actually detect and ensure that

1043
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,159
my mitigations are working

1044
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,119
it kind of stops right

1045
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,320
now there's different people that do

1046
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,079
threat modeling different ways

1047
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,839
this is a generic experience that i've

1048
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,359
had of a number of companies now over a

1049
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,960
number of years and threat modeling's

1050
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,079
evolved

1051
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,760
but i still see it as a problem it's

1052
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,119
like when i when i look at doing

1053
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,119
detection engineering and i go back to

1054
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,480
some of the app some of the some of the

1055
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,680
app developers and some of the app

1056
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,200
owners and things like that and i go so

1057
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,280
like you're sending me all these logs

1058
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,720
but what do you want me to actually

1059
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,880
detect in those logs what's your risk

1060
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,720
you know what's the threat that you that

1061
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,960
you have against that data or that

1062
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,599
application

1063
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,800
exactly but the problem is i'm the stock

1064
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,079
i'm the i'm doing the detection

1065
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,680
engineering but i don't know what the

1066
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,280
hell your application does i don't know

1067
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,119
what your logs are it's like you need to

1068
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,839
explain it to me right

1069
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,839
because otherwise it's just a bunch of

1070
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,880
data streaming into my sim

1071
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,200
and that's where i come back to i need i

1072
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,040
kind of want to do this

1073
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,880
top down like i suppose you could bottom

1074
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,160
up approach or top down approach

1075
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,520
whatever whichever way you want to look

1076
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,119
at it but i want to understand my

1077
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,400
capabilities and then map those

1078
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,760
capabilities into something that i'm

1079
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,000
protecting against

1080
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,200
where i'm protecting against something

1081
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,320
and i have capabilities that will help

1082
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,280
me protect against them

1083
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,000
that sounds like what my uh

1084
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,480
my grandpa used to say measure twice and

1085
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,960
cut once

1086
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,839
um

1087
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,599
i'm a big fan of asking what problem

1088
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,839
we're trying to solve before we get busy

1089
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:18,640
yeah

1090
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,640
and i like that mind mapping approach we

1091
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,079
have any more questions i think we have

1092
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,520
time for one more but make it

1093
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,599
going good

1094
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,280
twice let's have a round of applause for

1095
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,910
thomas thank you everybody today

1096
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,160
[Applause]

1097
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,520
so we're going to have about a ten

1098
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,920
minute break and then we have our finer

1099
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,480
final speaker in this block

1100
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,480
and so i look forward to seeing you back

1101
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,160
here or not if you want to come grab

1102
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,160
some belgian chocolates i'm not packing

1103
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,839
them back so come they're right there

1104
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,000
you
