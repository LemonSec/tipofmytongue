um

27
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,200
welcome to my presentation on knowledge

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,360
management nourishing and enhancing your

29
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,479
communication and intelligence

30
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,880
oh there we go my name is rebecca taylor

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,119
i've been at securex now for eight years

32
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,799
and have recently been nominated for a

33
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,439
women in tech excellence award

34
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,759
um i work in the incident response team

35
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,360
so working with our instant commanders

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,119
as their knowledge manager

37
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,880
and over the past 18 months have been

38
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,720
focusing on getting a series of

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,360
qualifications you can see there my gsec

40
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,280
and my

41
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,159
gsgisf

42
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,799
outside of work i live in london with my

43
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,640
husband and my two kids and i'm a

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,560
graduate of the university of portsmouth

45
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,240
having studied english and creative

46
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,320
writing so maybe a slightly different

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,439
angle to some of you folks here today

48
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,439
so i want to get straight into the

49
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,719
nitty-gritty

50
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,159
i'm here today to talk to you about

51
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,000
knowledge management the peaks and the

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,679
troughs the highs and the lows how to

53
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,000
push your teams and your intelligence to

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,200
the max

55
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,120
i want to start by saying that knowledge

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,400
management is something that is

57
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,480
constantly evolving

58
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,239
at least in my role

59
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,920
i am always finding new things i want to

60
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,800
capture new ways to capture it new ways

61
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,319
to share that and teach that out to the

62
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,480
people i work with so if something today

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,319
does so a seed in you and you do find

64
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,920
this of interest or maybe you already

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,840
know that you need to go back to your

66
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,360
organization and solve your knowledge

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,200
management issues

68
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,800
then there is so much information out

69
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,360
there for you to learn from so go out

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,120
there do your research and of course if

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,800
i can help you're welcome to reach out

72
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
to me on linkedin and we can have that

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
conversation

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,120
um

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,959
i also want to say that i have seen

76
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,319
knowledge management done in some

77
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,560
fantastic ways and some very innovative

78
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,400
ways but i've also seen knowledge

79
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,080
management struggle

80
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,159
so i'm hoping today i can sow some seeds

81
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,920
in your mind and help you share some of

82
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,680
the lessons that i've learned along the

83
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,840
way

84
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,120
so what if i told you that making a

85
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,200
decision to start small

86
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,920
and capture one nugget of information

87
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,480
changed the way that i work

88
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,959
what if i told you that as an ir

89
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,080
practice

90
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,800
by deciding what was important to us

91
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,720
documenting it and sharing it with

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,760
others it's changed how we function

93
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,599
today through this presentation i'm

94
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,360
going to give you an overview of how

95
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,200
knowledge management works how it looks

96
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,560
and feels

97
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,920
and then from there i'm going to share

98
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,599
with you some real life examples of what

99
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,000
i do in my role

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,920
so we'll start with this quote an

101
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,680
investment in knowledge pays the best

102
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,319
interest so that was said by benjamin

103
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,599
franklin

104
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,080
so knowledge can come in many different

105
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,959
forms it can be quantitative so we're

106
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,200
basically talking numbers trends

107
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,159
statistics or it can be qualitative so

108
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,159
in that sense it's things like playbooks

109
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,400
processes procedures

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,720
whatever the type of knowledge it is

111
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,080
it's important

112
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,239
that you invest your time understand

113
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,319
what knowledge you have what's available

114
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,920
to you

115
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,680
what you need to be successful and what

116
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,320
you need to be able to grow and learn

117
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,279
by investing starting small investing in

118
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,440
those small elements you can gain new

119
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,600
knowledge piece by piece and maybe at

120
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,840
some point even have a functioning

121
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,240
knowledge base

122
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,320
so if we start at a high level what is

123
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,759
knowledge management

124
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,440
so knowledge management is the process

125
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,440
of more effectively collecting sharing

126
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,520
maintaining or managing and deploying

127
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,280
organizational knowledge

128
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,040
it tends to come in three different

129
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,840
forms so there's explicit knowledge and

130
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,080
that is our formal or codified knowledge

131
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,280
so for a lot of you that's going to be

132
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,800
your playbooks your processes and

133
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,400
procedures

134
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,880
there's tacit knowledge which is

135
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,199
harder to explain harder to teach

136
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,240
someone but it's about being able to

137
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,120
um

138
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,440
think intuitively being able to be

139
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,440
innovative being able to understand body

140
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,880
language

141
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,400
and then there's implicit knowledge

142
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,160
which i think is our safe space where a

143
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,199
lot of us

144
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,199
are and that is things that we already

145
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,360
know that's in our minds but we haven't

146
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,520
quite found the right way to capture it

147
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,000
or share it out to others yet so as i

148
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,759
said i think that's where a lot of

149
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,000
organizations sit particularly if you've

150
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,440
been doing knowledge in a certain way

151
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,919
for a long period of time

152
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,600
so thinking about knowledge you can see

153
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,039
the circles there

154
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,360
they are some examples of knowledge so

155
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,120
it's basically our information our

156
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,960
intelligence and our facts

157
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,360
so examples could be i've said it a few

158
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,280
times processes and procedures it could

159
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,680
be our data points it could be customer

160
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,440
feedback and maybe do results from

161
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,880
questionnaires

162
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,639
and they all feed into our knowledge

163
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,840
base

164
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,240
so a knowledge base is a self-service

165
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,800
repository for information on a

166
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,160
particular product subject or service

167
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,319
so some organizations can have multiple

168
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,759
knowledge bases

169
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,000
or you may just have the one

170
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,560
for me my knowledge base that i use we

171
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,560
call it the major incident response plan

172
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,720
and it's our safe space it's our hub

173
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,800
it's our knowledge base where we keep

174
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,639
everything the instant commander team

175
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,600
need

176
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,520
so in there it's our documented

177
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,680
processes and procedures we have

178
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,960
templates templates are a big thing um

179
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,080
you will have

180
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,680
prebuilt information they can share with

181
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,160
customers and that's our knowledge base

182
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,600
but in our organization we also have

183
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,759
several others for example that hr or

184
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,080
maybe branding might use

185
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,880
at the end of all of that is the user so

186
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,880
knowledge management is very much the

187
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,319
circle of life

188
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,720
so you've got a user that's not only

189
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,400
using your searchable functional

190
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,960
database your knowledge base but they're

191
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,000
also feeding back maybe they spot a gap

192
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,360
maybe something you've got is incorrect

193
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,880
maybe they create something of their own

194
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,720
and they want to give it back to you so

195
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,479
it's very much a loop with knowledge and

196
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,960
that's where you get that nourishment

197
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
i do want to stress that and i do talk

198
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,400
about it later as well but this is where

199
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,080
reward and recognition kicks in when

200
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,680
you've got users that are engaging and

201
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,319
are feeding back into the process

202
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,199
wrapped all around this is framework

203
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,680
so the framework will decide and help

204
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,520
you plan how you're going to manage

205
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,360
control apply and monitor that

206
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,520
information so in there it may be things

207
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,080
like access controls change controls all

208
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,880
those kinds of things

209
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,639
if we think about framework a little bit

210
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,440
more there are a lot of frameworks

211
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,880
available to you

212
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,639
so some of you will be familiar with

213
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,919
itil

214
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,360
and there's the knowledge management

215
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,000
process model by bother which is much

216
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,479
more about understanding the human and

217
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,720
their requirements and then you slot

218
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,639
technology into that

219
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,160
there's also another example of the

220
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,000
knowledge management matrix by gambling

221
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,840
blackwell so that one is far more

222
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,160
theoretical um but it's built around the

223
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,360
concept of applying deciding and acting

224
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,919
whatever framework works for you is okay

225
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,240
there isn't a one-size-fits-all

226
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,879
but when you are picking a framework

227
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,039
it's important you consider these four

228
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,599
items so your content your people your

229
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,759
process and your technology

230
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,840
so from a people perspective you don't

231
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,360
want to create a knowledge base that

232
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,759
then slows everybody down or doesn't

233
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,319
work from a search perspective so making

234
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,000
sure it is making a difference having

235
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,240
that measurable increase is important

236
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,720
and it should connect people so say for

237
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,879
example i looked up a piece of material

238
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,800
i could see where it came from who's the

239
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,120
associated smes

240
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,200
from a technology perspective

241
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,799
it's not about going out there and

242
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,519
buying a really snazzy expensive tool

243
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,279
it's often about looking at what you

244
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,559
already have

245
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,200
and seeing if that can work for you i

246
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,399
think for a lot of people knowledge

247
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,160
management they think they need to go

248
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,760
and buy something

249
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,200
when actually there's a lot of tools we

250
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,720
all have that we just don't utilize

251
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,279
necessarily in the right ways

252
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,080
from a content perspective

253
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,320
you need to be able to foster knowledge

254
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,440
creation

255
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,720
there needs to be a mechanism for

256
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,080
sharing that and it should all

257
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,920
intertwine with a lovely rich user

258
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,160
experience and as again i said about it

259
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,519
earlier but having that reward and

260
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,120
recognition is really important so if

261
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,920
you've got folks investing their time

262
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,320
they're creating new materials they are

263
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,080
helping you along the way to create a

264
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,480
really good knowledge base that your

265
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,959
company your colleagues can trust

266
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,800
you should reward and recognize those

267
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,680
people because they didn't have to do it

268
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,000
and finally process so

269
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,279
that's where we're going to be thinking

270
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,519
more about access controls

271
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,519
maybe change controls

272
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,440
but it should also intertwine with the

273
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,480
process of if someone spots a gap

274
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,560
how how does it trigger to create new

275
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,080
relevant content

276
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,720
if you've got a contacts list in there

277
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,399
what's the trigger what's the mechanism

278
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,560
saying okay that person's left how are

279
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,880
we going to know to go and update that

280
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,279
so when you're deciding what framework

281
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,920
do your research pick what is applicable

282
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
to you and to how you want to work what

283
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,080
you want to store but just think about

284
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,720
these four points

285
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,519
so

286
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,160
as i said there are a lot of frameworks

287
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,560
available and there are a lot of tools

288
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,079
and some of them include content

289
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,839
management but that is very much a

290
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,440
different conversation

291
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,680
but you should also be thinking about

292
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,040
master data management so master data

293
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,000
management is the concept of having a

294
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,079
single source of truth

295
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,160
so somewhere that is kept safe

296
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,560
it's collected protected stored as

297
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,040
master data so for example other users

298
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
can't overwrite it

299
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,200
in some instances maybe you're a small

300
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,720
organization that isn't so much of a

301
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,360
problem um within instant response we're

302
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
all collaborating constantly so it's

303
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,440
okay for people to go and make tweaks as

304
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,880
they see new things

305
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,959
but if you have a far larger knowledge

306
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,640
base you may need to consider master

307
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,000
data management

308
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,680
and again there's a lot of information

309
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,279
out there to help you scope

310
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,120
appropriately and to figure out the

311
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,480
right knowledge management base and

312
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,240
process for you

313
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,680
regardless

314
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,519
every transaction every piece of

315
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,320
knowledge must be reliable and it must

316
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,519
be trustworthy if you start allowing

317
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,279
information to filter out into your

318
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,320
system

319
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,839
that isn't trustworthy you're going to

320
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,240
drive people away from using it so

321
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,920
making sure that you have reliable

322
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,600
information in there maybe doing some

323
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,079
auditing at least on a quarterly basis

324
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,640
is a good behavior to have

325
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,880
small changes can make a very immediate

326
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,000
difference

327
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,160
so for me when i started in my knowledge

328
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,000
management role in ir

329
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,160
we didn't yet have a consistent way of

330
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,399
being able to categorize and label our

331
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,000
instant types

332
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,720
so i started about two years ago for our

333
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,160
instant command team

334
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,000
labeling the instance that came through

335
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,040
the door

336
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,120
and i'm now in a position where i'm able

337
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,880
to see those peaks and troughs the

338
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,040
trends what exactly is happening in our

339
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,800
instant command team

340
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,560
so whilst that feeds into some really

341
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,120
lovely reporting and some statistics

342
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,959
what it does mean is that as a knowledge

343
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,519
manager i'm able to go okay this is what

344
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,839
my team need we're doing maybe more

345
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,480
ransomware incidents than we're doing

346
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,800
ddos attacks so let's make sure the

347
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,560
content we create that's in our

348
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,639
searchable knowledge base is maybe

349
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,880
heavier on that side let's make sure we

350
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
have more project plans let's make sure

351
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,639
we have more customer facing materials

352
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,880
focused on that topic because that's the

353
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,639
drive that's where we're seeing

354
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,160
a lot of effort

355
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,680
and i'm now in a really lovely position

356
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,560
where

357
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,959
by making that small change it's enabled

358
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,639
us to see that actually it is worth the

359
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,560
investment it is worth the time and now

360
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,480
we're looking at that across the entire

361
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,880
practice because we know it's important

362
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,800
so small changes can make an immediate

363
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,360
difference to how you function

364
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,760
and i've said it already but often we

365
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,440
have tools and methods in-house and we

366
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,279
just don't know enough about them

367
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,800
so making sure when you're scoping and

368
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,240
deciding what tool you want to use

369
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,680
make sure you just understand before you

370
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,200
go and buy something really expensive

371
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,959
and snazzy with all their bells and

372
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,599
whistles on it

373
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,959
so like anything there's always going to

374
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,560
be barriers to making it successful um

375
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,240
so i'll touch on some of these here with

376
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,200
you the first one is privacy

377
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,279
so like anything if you're collecting

378
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,720
and storing certain pieces of

379
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,240
information there can be privacy

380
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,440
concerns

381
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,839
maybe you don't want it to be accessible

382
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,360
to certain people maybe there's

383
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,519
additional storage requirements

384
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,519
so doing a full privacy scope when

385
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,120
you're heading into knowledge management

386
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,279
is critical because if you don't do that

387
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,959
in the beginning you could just end up

388
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,240
spending a lot of time creating

389
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,680
something really beautiful for it then

390
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,800
to be taken back down another one is

391
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,839
motivation so believe it or not a lot of

392
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,680
people really really can't be bothered

393
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,600
to sit down and write down everything

394
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,760
they know they've been performing in a

395
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,839
certain way maybe they've worked in ir

396
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,480
forever and then me walking up going can

397
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,880
you write that down no because i already

398
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,680
know

399
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,560
so having the right motivational points

400
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,399
being able to explain why they should do

401
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,800
it having leadership buy-in

402
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,720
again reward and recognition can all

403
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,880
help motivate your colleagues your team

404
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,639
members in the right way to share and

405
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,480
document their knowledge

406
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,959
and finally change which i guess does

407
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,680
link with motivation but i'm sure all of

408
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,360
us here have experienced change

409
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,160
adversity that fear of having to shake

410
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,240
things up and do things differently so

411
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,320
again having leadership buying

412
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,399
being prepared to explain why it's

413
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,639
important providing training and

414
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,320
material to support people through

415
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,079
change if you're deploying a new

416
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,040
knowledge base will all again lead to it

417
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,360
hopefully being a successful transition

418
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,920
so knowledge is of no value unless you

419
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,600
put it into practice

420
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,760
so we've spoken about the fundamentals

421
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,519
we've spoken about how you can pick a

422
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,920
framework but it has to work for you

423
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,760
we've spoken about challenges that you

424
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,199
can face along the way that you should

425
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,560
be considering

426
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,399
but how do we put all of this into

427
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,079
practice particularly from a cyber

428
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,040
security and ir perspective

429
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,959
what examples or practices do we have to

430
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,880
demonstrate how it works

431
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,959
and how can we do all of this before an

432
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,320
incident happens

433
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,240
the last thing you want is to be in an

434
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,560
incident and then your consultants your

435
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,079
team members are going

436
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,680
either rogue and creating their own

437
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,600
materials or they can't find what they

438
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,000
need there's a lot that you can do in

439
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,240
advance by having a stable knowledge

440
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,760
base

441
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,040
so i'm going to put on my knowledge

442
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
manager hat and i'm going to share with

443
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,440
you what i do what i've learned what i

444
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,040
prioritize

445
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,880
so i've already touched on the fact that

446
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,120
proactively i look after our major

447
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,199
instant response plan so that's the safe

448
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,279
space that's our knowledge base where

449
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,880
our incident commanders can go in and

450
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,199
search what they need to be successful

451
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,279
and to deliver to a customer

452
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,199
on the other side of that my role is to

453
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,519
work reactively during an emergency

454
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,040
incident

455
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,759
so with that in mind during an emergency

456
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,839
incident these are the three things that

457
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,079
i personally prioritize it's

458
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,560
communication work streams and data

459
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,600
capture

460
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,759
so communications you have to get it

461
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,320
right it is critical if you don't set

462
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,160
yourself up to have the right visibility

463
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,000
from the beginning you're going to miss

464
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,399
your little gems of knowledge

465
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,880
work streams with work streams come

466
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,399
roles and responsibilities

467
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,399
accountabilities of those are supporting

468
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,800
you during your ir engagement so having

469
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,360
again those set up socialized is

470
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,000
important and finally data capture so

471
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,279
that's going to touch on things like

472
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,279
templates but it's also going to focus

473
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,199
on making sure that what you do capture

474
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,519
can be quickly ingested um there's no

475
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,600
point having all these lovely templates

476
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,120
and forms if they're in a completely

477
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
different format to actually what you

478
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,199
need to be able to to turn it into

479
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,079
knowledge and intelligence

480
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,959
so thinking more about communication

481
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,759
a lot of what happens with communication

482
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,360
needs to be very much protected and

483
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,360
stored appropriately

484
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,279
if you don't set it up right from the

485
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,199
very beginning you will not have the

486
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,440
right visibility you need nor will you

487
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,240
have the right protective capabilities

488
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,560
so within communication as a concept

489
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,920
you're going to see things when you're

490
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,400
working with a customer such as approved

491
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,480
communication plans and structures who

492
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,280
do i talk to about what and when you're

493
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,439
going to see the boundaries for delivery

494
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,720
so

495
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,839
as

496
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,240
a team what can we work up till and then

497
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,199
when do we need to go back to the

498
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,119
customer to ask for more or to ask for

499
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,240
permissions

500
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,359
you're going to see things like

501
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,039
escalation procedures and critical

502
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,760
findings who do i call at three in the

503
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,760
morning when an alarm goes off or when

504
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,679
we find something

505
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,280
you're going to see contacts including

506
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,440
reasonable adjustments so that is one

507
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,799
that i'm particularly passionate about

508
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,919
that i will share with you in a few

509
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,280
slides time

510
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,400
you're also going to understand

511
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,320
reporting mechanisms

512
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,280
so

513
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,360
as part of communication different

514
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,880
stakeholders different individuals will

515
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,799
have reporting needs they need that

516
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,480
visibility themselves to know where they

517
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,720
are maybe how many hours they've used

518
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,039
maybe how much money they've spent and

519
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,880
so having the right reporting mechanisms

520
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
in place knowing what they need is again

521
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,400
important to having a successful

522
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,960
communication pathway

523
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,039
three that have become more and more

524
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,039
common and that we see much more

525
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,840
are governance legal and insurance so

526
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,240
again i'm sure they're words or concepts

527
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,080
that you are very familiar with

528
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,480
but in ir they're very much

529
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,160
coming to the forefront and teams that

530
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,520
we're having to engage with and be

531
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,080
prepared to work with

532
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,039
so

533
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,039
touching on those whether from a

534
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,200
governance perspective you're having to

535
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,520
be prepared for disclosures you're

536
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,880
having to implement appropriate

537
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,120
techniques for data handling

538
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,360
maybe from an insurance perspective you

539
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,520
need to be on a panel so you can deliver

540
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,679
to your customer you need to have sales

541
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,880
in place you need to understand the

542
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,440
caveats of any agreements your customer

543
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,799
has with their policy provider

544
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,120
maybe from a legal perspective

545
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,440
you need to work under privilege or you

546
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,799
need to be prepared to work with law

547
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,360
enforcement or even for litigation

548
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,760
all of these kinds of things can be

549
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,240
prepared in advance from an insurer

550
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,520
perspective you can have those

551
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,360
conversations you can know what reports

552
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,440
they would like and how they want it you

553
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,080
can have pre-built sales for engagement

554
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,000
from a governance perspective you can

555
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,880
have notification templates drawn up so

556
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,799
as and when it's required you can pull

557
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,160
it out of your knowledge base and your

558
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,240
team are good to go

559
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,799
legal wise you can have

560
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,480
ways already of engaging with law

561
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,640
enforcement and again those materials

562
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,960
pre-built so everyone knows where to go

563
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
and what to use when they need it

564
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,280
so whilst these work streams i suppose

565
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,360
can feel quite daunting for what they

566
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,280
represent a lot of what happens with

567
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,720
them can be pre-discussed pre-approved

568
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
and you can be in a much safer space

569
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,320
when you're in the heat of that incident

570
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,960
so moving on to work streams

571
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,039
this is just an image

572
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,360
that we use at work

573
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,000
so we mainly use microsoft teams as a

574
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,840
safe space to our to collaborate with

575
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,440
our customers and you can see they're

576
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,039
under the team's channels they're

577
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,600
typically the work streams that i set up

578
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,280
and work with

579
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,159
so

580
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,080
what's quite nice about having this

581
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,039
image is you can see under each one

582
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,039
there's that standardized

583
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,640
work stream framework so for example

584
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,159
if i have a consultant working with me

585
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,080
they're in the forensics workstream or

586
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,159
forensic yeah forensics workstream

587
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,039
then

588
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,080
they know their roles and

589
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,760
responsibilities they know the

590
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,440
expectations of them for being in that

591
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,280
work stream they know that there's

592
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,720
templates they have to fill out for

593
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,280
example an indicator of compromise

594
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,039
tracker they know that maybe they have

595
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,200
to fill out a time card tracker

596
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,360
maybe under communication everyone that

597
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,640
works with me knows that if you go to

598
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,760
communication that's where you're going

599
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,000
to find that communication plan any

600
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,400
pre-agreed prerequisites the customer

601
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,440
has

602
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,640
so by having work streams you're able to

603
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,720
assign those roles and responsibilities

604
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,280
as long as you socialize it so again

605
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,640
those that then work within those

606
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,440
streams know the expectation of them and

607
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,200
as knowledge manager if i need to find

608
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,280
something i know exactly what work

609
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,600
stream to go to exactly what template to

610
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
use because it's all been pre-agreed

611
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,440
it's all been pre-templated and it's

612
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,640
already been socialized

613
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,240
so going on to templates um

614
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,840
there's various templates you can use

615
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,039
and it's very much down to what's

616
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,559
important to you and what you want to

617
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,480
capture but as i said before it's

618
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,679
important that when you're building a

619
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,600
template you think about how it's going

620
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,159
to be ingested and used at the other end

621
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,000
there's no point building a really

622
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,159
elaborate lovely excel spreadsheet if

623
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,520
then you have to rip it all apart the

624
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,960
other end to try and get the good stuff

625
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,000
out

626
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
so knowing the start to finish scoping

627
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,440
what you're making and who's going to

628
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,880
use it is important for them being

629
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,400
successful

630
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,320
but some that we use here we've got time

631
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,000
trackers we've got those indicator of

632
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,480
compromise trackers i spoke about task

633
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,039
trackers um but one i just want to touch

634
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,640
on is the contacts and reasonable

635
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,159
adjustments form

636
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,919
so that one's been a bit of a game

637
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,919
changer for us because it not only

638
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,159
collects more of the formal knowledge we

639
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,480
need so who are we working with who do

640
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,000
we escalate to

641
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,159
but it also allows people to share any

642
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,480
reasonable adjustment requirements

643
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,240
so by that i mean

644
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,760
examples we've had is we've had

645
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
customers come back to us and say oh

646
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,039
i've never been asked that before but

647
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,200
actually in our team several of my

648
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
colleagues are colour blind so can you

649
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,880
make an adjustment just to the colours

650
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,960
you use in any materials you give to us

651
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,360
absolutely now we know and we can work

652
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,280
better and more collaboratively

653
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,000
i think in ir being able to work more

654
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,520
collaboratively is what's going to make

655
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,280
it successful

656
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,159
um

657
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,919
we've also had examples of saying people

658
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,080
saying can you use a larger font

659
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,640
can you use more graphic presentations

660
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,080
than giving me lots of words because i

661
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,799
find it harder to process so again

662
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,799
having those reasonable adjustments has

663
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,640
been a bit of a game changer in the way

664
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,799
that we work

665
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,880
so when we think about knowledge and

666
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,200
intelligence these are the questions i

667
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,120
tend to ask myself at least on a

668
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,720
quarterly basis

669
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,039
i touched on earlier that knowledge is

670
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,520
constantly evolving and changing

671
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,039
so being able to look at your knowledge

672
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,600
base and say each time has it evolved

673
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,840
has it changed what else do i need is

674
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,960
important

675
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,559
so these questions

676
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,640
what information do we need to be

677
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,240
capturing and where

678
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
how can this benefit both or other

679
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,640
organizations what are the work streams

680
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,039
and my expectations of them how do we

681
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,520
collaborate how do i connect the dots

682
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,679
so as i said making sure you're thinking

683
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,400
of those as you're making changes or

684
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,760
checking in with yourself that what

685
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,440
you're doing is right still for your

686
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,840
team is important to allow knowledge and

687
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,200
intelligence to be successful

688
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,760
so going back to putting my knowledge

689
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,080
management hat on um i want to share

690
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,320
with you how doing all these things

691
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,840
being aware of these frameworks being

692
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,159
aware of these behaviors has fed into

693
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,120
our own knowledge management success

694
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,039
so you can see here we've got a lot of

695
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,799
different knowledge or intelligence

696
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,120
points in our organization

697
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,120
so to put it into context we have around

698
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,720
1400 ir engagements per year around 5

699
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,039
300 customers we look at about 3

700
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,480
trillion events a week

701
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,159
and we have around nine petabytes of

702
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,159
client telemetry so

703
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,000
that's a lot of information obviously

704
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,200
you may be sitting here thinking well i

705
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,360
have more that's lovely but for us

706
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,960
that's a lot of knowledge to be looking

707
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,120
after and to be filtering and using in

708
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,480
the right ways

709
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,880
so that can be dark web searches that

710
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,480
can be stuff coming out of ir

711
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,880
engagements it can be research

712
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,640
um but whatever it is we need to make

713
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,320
sure that we are fostering it and

714
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,600
filtering it to the appropriate people

715
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,880
so as i said you may be sitting and

716
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,640
thinking yeah we're relatively similar

717
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,440
we look at the same kinds of things um

718
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,039
but what could it become if i spent the

719
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,640
time on on building an appropriate

720
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,720
knowledge base what could i gain where

721
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,320
could these gems these little nuggets of

722
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,360
information go

723
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,760
so for us we began working with a really

724
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,240
fantastic organization called ripger

725
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,880
and we created tims which is our threat

726
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,440
intelligence management system

727
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,480
we needed a way to store arthritis and

728
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,320
we needed to make it useful for both our

729
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
teams and our tools

730
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,080
and we needed a structured way to

731
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,000
support all those differing knowledge

732
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,919
points

733
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,159
so we started with a focus on mapping

734
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,960
telemetry and the data points we had

735
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,640
which then fed into the workflows to

736
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,960
support data access normalizations and

737
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,279
customizations so really starting to

738
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,960
think about how we could nourish and

739
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,880
improve what we already had at our

740
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,120
fingertips

741
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,039
from there we can we began to pull data

742
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,960
from other sources so that is things

743
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,799
like intelligence telemetry other

744
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,480
enrichments because we really wanted to

745
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,480
add weight and maybe more context to

746
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,000
what we already had

747
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
and then we wanted to make it searchable

748
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,080
and accessible so as i said earlier

749
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,600
having a knowledge base where people can

750
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,440
trust it but they can move around it is

751
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,600
accessible it's easy to use is what's

752
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,360
going to make it a successful knowledge

753
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,240
management system

754
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,640
from there we

755
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,400
as i said earlier it's the circle of

756
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,799
life so we wanted to make sure that when

757
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,320
people are gleaning intelligence new

758
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,159
information that we're feeding it back

759
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,320
into what we do so that's where it fed

760
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,080
into quick ingestion and so this

761
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
indicator of compromise importer was

762
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,799
created it's just a smoother process for

763
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,480
getting that information in

764
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,279
and then it allowed our teams so ir

765
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,360
maybe the counter threat unit to be able

766
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,919
to connect the dots between engagements

767
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,760
so that i think was a turning point

768
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,880
where then

769
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,799
people saw the weight of what they could

770
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,039
actually learn and actually see and

771
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,279
often in our engagements this is this

772
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,600
can be a turning point when we're using

773
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,480
tims

774
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,159
so for example an indicator of

775
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,480
compromise is uploaded

776
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,720
um it's compared to the the intelligence

777
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,400
we have and nourished and then it might

778
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,960
go oh yeah we've seen that before that's

779
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,360
this threat actor or we've written tips

780
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,440
about that before or oh it was on this

781
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,760
other engagement so as a consultant as a

782
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,720
knowledge manager i can go oh okay i can

783
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,320
go and talk to my colleague and see what

784
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,120
happened what was their report like

785
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,799
maybe it can help you predict what might

786
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,600
happen next

787
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,200
from there i think like most

788
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,279
organizations we thought yay let's

789
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,919
automate and so we began focusing on

790
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,840
automating our briefings our profiles

791
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,480
which are on our customer facing website

792
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,120
and just the way we really connect

793
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,799
collected data

794
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:17,840
um

795
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,279
and then from there we went on to

796
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,279
enhancing our api streams and accessible

797
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,200
knowledge browsers so one there that's

798
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,159
really important to me uh is to the

799
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,159
left hand side and that one is called

800
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,200
elmo and the beauty of that is if we

801
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,440
have a customer say we found out it's a

802
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,679
particular threat group

803
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,799
we can go into that space it's a safe

804
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,159
space where we have pulled out anything

805
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,679
like indicators

806
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:44,399
and

807
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,840
it will show things we can immediately

808
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,840
share with the customer

809
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,000
so it filters out from the main tim's

810
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,120
knowledge base into this elmo browser

811
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,520
as an engagement or during an engagement

812
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,200
it just adds that weight to be able to

813
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,399
say to a customer we know what we're

814
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,159
talking about here's some materials you

815
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,480
can read and as an ir consultant or

816
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,919
knowledge manager i know it's already

817
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,279
safe

818
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,320
so that's one that's really special

819
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,200
so

820
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,960
going right back to where we started an

821
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,880
investment in knowledge pays the best

822
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,840
interest so by making small changes

823
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,039
capturing what's important to your

824
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,440
organization your cyber efforts and your

825
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,919
customers you can gain interest in many

826
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,200
many ways

827
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,360
and more amazingly than that you can do

828
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,559
so much of it in advance

829
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,799
so if you're going to take a picture

830
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,960
this is probably the slide to grab

831
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,640
so you need to

832
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,480
understand what you want to collect now

833
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,320
and what you do with it

834
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,760
understand what you want to collect and

835
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,120
why you don't

836
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,559
what's the plan what's the framework

837
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,600
what's the mechanism do you have a tool

838
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,679
you need to templatize the basics to

839
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,159
allow for consistency you can do it in

840
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,159
advance and then it won't be in the heat

841
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,440
of an incident

842
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,080
you must prioritize strong communication

843
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,960
work streams and data capture and take

844
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,399
small steps it isn't about going full in

845
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,840
we need knowledge management let's do

846
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,679
everything we possibly can immediately

847
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,240
it's about those small initial changes

848
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,720
and it's not about expensive tools

849
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,640
understand what you have start there

850
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,559
first

851
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,960
knowledge is power knowledge shared is

852
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,640
power multiplied

853
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,200

what i can say that's what i like in

865
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,520
your presentation is it started from a

866
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,840
very general point of view and then

867
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,520
at the end of it you can focus and

868
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,960
really uh make it actionable for your uh

869
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,120
for your teams and you also insisted a

870
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,799
lot on the uh

871
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,559
i would say on the human on the people

872
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,960
aspects which is also something i

873
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,720
believe is very important for our team

874
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,520
so

875
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,840
thanks for these visitors and insisting

876
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,799
on that

877
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,320
thank you thank you for the opportunity

878
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,960
and have a really good first thank you

879
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,120
thank you

880
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,559
so we'll make a short break 10 minutes

881
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,720
break and oh sorry

882
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,760
i didn't see andrew

883
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,760
takes start with small steps sorry

884
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,200
andrew cormac from jisc um

885
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,840
would that be for example one

886
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,559
arm of your big spider diagram so will

887
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,200
we do threat intelligence or we do

888
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,559
legal

889
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,960
or you know how do you start

890
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,559
slicing the cake i feel like we're going

891
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,520
to sing to each other yes

892
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,519
um so i think it really depends on

893
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,480
what's important to you as an

894
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,360
organization so you can start small if

895
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,960
you just identify something that's

896
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,440
special to you so maybe you need to get

897
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,360
that leadership buy-in first so that

898
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,960
they invest and they want to go down the

899
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,360
knowledge management route but of course

900
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,200
if looking at that spider diagram you

901
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,799
thought yeah i want to start with threat

902
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,480
intelligence and that's absolutely fine

903
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,640
to do that too it really is down to what

904
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,480
you want it to be and how you want it to

905
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,200
work

906
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,919
okay thank you

907
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,600
hey

908
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,840
no more questions really okay so let's

909
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,960
take a short break and we'll be back in

910
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,720
less than 10 minutes for the next

911
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,760
presentation related to run somewhere by

912
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,760

913
