[Music]

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,080
perfect so welcome everybody to the last

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,679
session uh on tuesday so my name is

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,160
still matthias i'm the session chair for

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,199
today

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,039
and as usual

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,880
if you have any questions after the

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,279
talks we have microphones here and there

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,279
so please line up at the microphones and

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,680
ask your questions there

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,880
please do the speakers a favor there is

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,160
a survey in the official first app so

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,120
give them a feedback after the talk

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,280
if you have any devices in here that

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,079
could make loud noises please be so kind

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,600
and turn them off good and today on

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,879
stage you have justin who's a researcher

18
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,840
with the crowdstrike and amy who's also

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,800
with crowdstrike and the presentation

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,239
today is to give you an understanding of

21
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,199
adversity trends in the linux space

22
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,199
empowering you to build proactive

23
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,438
hunting capabilities

24
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,159
and specifically targeted towards the

25
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,560
linux operating system so give them a

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,560
warm applause and the stage is yours

27
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,520
[Applause]

28
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,240
thank you for that introduction um

29
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,360
thanks to you all for coming i know it's

30
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,560
the end of the day and everybody

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,560
probably is thinking about drinks and

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,640
other things beyond this talk so we

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,799
promise not to go super long

34
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,640
but if we do well i wouldn't mind a

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,880
drink afterwards um a little bit about

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,040
myself my name is justin swisher i've

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,560
been in this space for a little over a

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,560
decade i started my career as an

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,079
intelligence analyst for the u.s air

40
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,079
force looked at foreign networks and

41
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:44,880
then

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,399
foreign malware against air and space

43
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,720
systems when i left the government i

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,759
went to

45
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,159
telecom and did network security and

46
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,000
then for the past few years i've focused

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,520
most of my time heavily on endpoint

48
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,960
threat hunting you know building out

49
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,479
threatening practices researching

50
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,000
adversary behaviors and things like that

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,159
i'm amy holston i've been in this

52
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,560
industry for about six years now i

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,479
started out as an intern in an instant

54
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,080
response department

55
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,840
uh spent a few years doing instant

56
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,160
response across the automotive aerospace

57
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,400
and defense industries which was really

58
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,239
interesting had a little venture into

59
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,000
threat intelligence specifically focused

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,680
on instant response

61
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,760
and now like justin i'm an intrusion

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,879
researcher with crowdstrike

63
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,879
but what do we mean by intrusion

64
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,280
research

65
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,840
as former threat hunters both of us we

66
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,760
are still throughout hunters but we sit

67
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,319
alongside our frontline threat hunting

68
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,360
team to do that slow time analysis so if

69
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,440
you were here earlier you may have heard

70
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,760
joe slovik's talk about building threat

71
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,920
hunting capabilities and hypothesis

72
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,959
testing

73
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,040
we kind of sit behind the scenes so we

74
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,480
are taking

75
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,160
uh telemetry from hands on keyboard

76
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,519
intrusions things that the threat

77
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,760
hunters find have to triage and manage

78
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,000
quickly and we are going through it line

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,159
by line to try and draw out anything

80
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,879
else taking metadata from the intrusion

81
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,120
looking at all types of events

82
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,000
um looking specifically for hands-on

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
keyboard adversary behavior so this is

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,480
where we think it's not automated in

85
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,080
well not automated to begin with they

86
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,840
will sometimes use scripts to automate

87
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,720
things

88
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
um but where we're seeing the sort of

89
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,800
human behind the keyboard taking steps

90
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,040
to defeat automated tooling

91
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,799
taking steps to try and stay under the

92
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,120
radar and trying to look at

93
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,280
really what they're doing and where they

94
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,879
are leaving signals

95
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,239
in a lot of noise and we do this across

96
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,560
the main operating systems and a lot of

97
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,720
it does kind of boil down to splunk

98
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,239
searches

99
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,280
um but we get quite far using tools like

100
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,360
excel and pivot tables

101
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,120
and although it isn't particularly fun

102
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,519
to go through 10 000 lines for of

103
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,519
intrusion data

104
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,439
line by line and try and enrich that and

105
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,120
work out what exactly was going on in

106
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,040
the intent behind it it does get us

107
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,280
quite far

108
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,200
so 10 000 lines going through it

109
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,040
individually obviously has a high

110
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,239
operational cost so why bother doing it

111
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,680
for us it's all about really

112
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,200
understanding

113
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,519
not just those kind of successful

114
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,680
patterns in our successes but also the

115
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,199
adversaries

116
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,720
where are they

117
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,959
repeatedly using the same techniques so

118
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,960
we look at things like

119
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,280
they ran this exact command

120
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,880
how many other intrusions have this

121
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,440
command why are they using it is it

122
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,440
because it's successful every time does

123
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,440
this represent a gap

124
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,880
in our telemetry or in our tooling

125
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,520
is this somewhere that we're failing

126
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,400
um looking before the actual if we've

127
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,320
been successful in

128
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,840
seeing something was there some

129
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,680
telemetry before that that was better

130
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,759
signal or signal that could have

131
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,680
helped us to

132
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,000
pick up on this intrusion earlier and on

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,600
the reverse of that

134
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,960
is there anything afterwards that

135
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,880
happens that we're also not pulling the

136
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,600
signal out of where we can say okay if

137
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,199
the adversary changes what they're doing

138
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,199
here that's okay because we'll still

139
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,320
catch it like five lines down or

140
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,919
depending on the intrusion it could be

141
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,520
like five minutes later but it's still

142
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,479
bad

143
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,720
to detect the intrusion five minutes

144
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,120
later than never

145
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,800
and a key part of this which justin's

146
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,560
going to go into is making sure we have

147
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,600
a consistent method to document this

148
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,039
intrusion we call it intrusion

149
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,560
enrichment internally

150
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,400
but to document everything as we're

151
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,919
going through we have a consistent

152
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,400
framework so that we're able to then

153
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,720
build up trends over time and give us a

154
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,720
historic view on what's going on and

155
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,199
also like a current view so what is the

156
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,440
actor doing today that they didn't do

157
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,520
six months ago a year ago

158
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,960
and what do we think

159
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,240
how do we think that will involve

160
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,840
tomorrow

161
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,800
um

162
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,639
it gives us the opportunity as well from

163
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,880
a kind of fun point of view to see where

164
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,479
the adversaries

165
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,560
are just humans where they mess up where

166
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,960
they hop onto a linux box for example

167
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,720
and immediately start running powershell

168
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,560
commands because they have no idea where

169
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,680
they are or what they're doing and

170
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,800
they've skipped some steps

171
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,800
it also lets us see where they've kind

172
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,720
of learned from their past mistakes so

173
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,720
where they are growing and developing

174
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,080
and also

175
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,680
by looking at sort of

176
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,520
clusters of events together

177
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,680
how they've been mapped and enriched

178
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,919
where that activity might represent the

179
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,080
same subset of people doing this

180
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,319
activity time and again

181
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,199
um

182
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,400
and yeah it's

183
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,840
really all about

184
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,199
tracking it together and doing it

185
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,120
consistently yeah

186
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,479
so

187
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,520
let's

188
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,120
talk about obviously when we track this

189
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,360
stuff that's great but we have to have

190
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,479
some sort of

191
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,240
knowledge management or data storage or

192
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,919
memorialization otherwise we're just

193
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,600
kind of doing the same thing over and

194
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,919
over again and that has been for us one

195
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,160
of the largest challenges when it comes

196
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,720
to working on this research is this data

197
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,400
is very disparate right we have command

198
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,919
lines we have command line arguments we

199
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,360
have host details we have customer

200
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,960
details right we have all these

201
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,120
different types of metadata that we need

202
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,720
to find a way to structure so that we

203
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,560
can query it and ask questions right

204
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,319
what is the trends what type of command

205
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,479
lines are repeated over and over again

206
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,759
you know where am i seeing different

207
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,199
activity and if you don't have that

208
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,960
stored in a great way

209
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,479
it makes your research and larger

210
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,960
picture analysis a lot more difficult

211
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,479
so obviously there's some open source

212
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,319
tools out there as you mentioned we all

213
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,000
love excel you know you can throw lots

214
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,680
of stuff in csvs

215
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,199
you can use the miter attack navigator

216
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,639
if you want to see heat maps around the

217
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,800
techniques look in the different tactics

218
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,400
and try and find a pattern of activity

219
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,000
where are things you know what type of

220
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,840
defensive agent are they doing the most

221
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,720
um

222
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,599
for

223
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,520
our purposes the team's been around

224
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,759
about a few years now and for the last

225
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,160
couple years we've been using misp now

226
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,520
you're probably if you're familiar with

227
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,879
mist you're probably going why are you

228
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,479
using this that's not what it's built

229
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,479
for and you are correct it is not what

230
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,440
it's built for however for our purposes

231
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,879
and getting the team spun up and getting

232
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,479
this activity going and tracking and

233
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,840
recording it's worked very well thus far

234
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,280
so this is kind of a

235
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,280
test example of how we use mist right

236
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,879
we've got um

237
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,639
we use the tagging structure heavily

238
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,479
that is for kind of like that that

239
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,000
metadata where

240
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,520
you know it's it's customer vertical

241
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,520
right we can track what adversaries are

242
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,879
doing against customer verticals are we

243
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,800
seeing a spike in manufacturing targeted

244
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,280
activity or an increase in e-crime and

245
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,440
technology uh we tag it with actor

246
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,759
motivation any sort of metric that we

247
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,599
want to track that maybe isn't inherent

248
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,440
in misp we will add a tag in an

249
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,919
attribute so we track what we call

250
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,599
breakout time right so adversary gets on

251
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,599
a box how quickly do they laterally move

252
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,159
to another box uh we will use a tag to

253
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,080
note that intrusion had a breakout event

254
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,839
and then we'll use an attribute for

255
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,039
adding the timing right we'll use a

256
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,760
counter value we've taken the galaxies

257
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,919
modified them slightly so we have region

258
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,120
for customers

259
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,959
uh the different crowdstrike adversaries

260
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,720
right if we know it's you know

261
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,480
silent chilema or wicked panda or

262
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,399
something tooling as well obviously we

263
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,320
use the mist tools but we'll we can

264
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,920
import our own tooling into the galaxy

265
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,839
which makes it easier to track

266
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,120
and then the big thing for us is the

267
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,040
miter technique tagging

268
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,519
we use that heavily any sort of activity

269
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,360
that we observe on the command line we

270
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,120
are tagging it to a miter technique if

271
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,720
possible

272
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,440
now

273
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,720
again i mentioned it's not perfect

274
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,480
because this isn't what it's built for

275
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,519
some of the

276
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,279
things that we're seeing is a couple

277
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,360
years ago we saw you know three or four

278
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,120
hands on keyboard intrusions a week

279
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,399
right now we're averaging what 30 40 50.

280
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,000
you know this doesn't scale especially

281
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,080
when we want to look at what command

282
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,519
line arguments were used in that

283
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,200
technique how can i look across a

284
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,480
technique for multiple command line

285
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,320
arguments right now that data is stored

286
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,680
separately in an attribute so they're

287
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
not correlated we're building a tool

288
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,279
internally

289
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,519
to try and better solve this and start

290
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,080
to say ask more robust questions of the

291
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,600
data and and really start to do some

292
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,680
analytics on okay when you talk about os

293
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,200
credential dumping what do they do on

294
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,880
the command line do they use mimics do

295
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,880
they use com services you know did they

296
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,120
dump lsas or the red you know use

297
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,040
registry to dump the sam we need to have

298
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,800
that sort of better visibility and that

299
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,920
helps us with our tracking

300
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,519
so um amy mentioned framework and this

301
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,839
is really important i think for any sort

302
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,519
of process when you want repeatability

303
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,880
and growth

304
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,720
we use the term search right it's an

305
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,519
acronym and we use it both tactically

306
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,600
and strategically so from you know we

307
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,519
start with sense this is the data this

308
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,680
is the foundation of the work right you

309
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,680
need good data thankfully we have good

310
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,000
data where we work um it's a really

311
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,760
strong foundation and then you move to

312
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,000
enrich so for anybody who has thread

313
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,279
intel feeds or whatever if you're

314
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,959
bringing in your raw data you're going

315
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,959
to enrich it you're going to add context

316
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,079
things like

317
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,920
you know his adversaries any sort of

318
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,519
threat until fee that you can provide on

319
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,560
there and then you bring in analysis so

320
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,399
from a tactical level analytically

321
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,560
you're looking at hunting triggers what

322
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,160
am i observing so that i can build a

323
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,920
quick picture and communicate it out to

324
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,320
my customer my end user my sock whatever

325
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,560
from a strategic perspective like amy

326
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,000
was saying we're analyzing the larger

327
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,160
intrusion as a whole event because one

328
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,279
of the things that we like to say is an

329
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,360
intrusion is not a single event it is a

330
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,800
series of events right a lot of people

331
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,240
think oh intrusion they got in that was

332
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,519
the big part yeah but what did they do

333
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,040
before they got it what did they do

334
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,320
after they got in so that's where we

335
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,920
build out that picture and we

336
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,000
reconstruct the activity so that we can

337
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,760
communicate it tactically that

338
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,200
communication is

339
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,720
a notification to the customer

340
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,240
notification to the sock what it might

341
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,399
be strategically we're going to write a

342
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,000
report we're going to write blogs we're

343
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,680
going to communicate around the entire

344
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,920
intrusion or a campaign of intrusions

345
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,079
and then you know we hone our processes

346
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,839
so

347
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,040
tactically what did we catch where did

348
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,480
we catch it could we catch it earlier

349
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,000
can we develop a new pattern that's a

350
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,480
better efficiency or you know tightly

351
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,440
scopes

352
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,279
from a strategic perspective how are our

353
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,720
comms working are we communicating the

354
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,320
right things to the customers do they

355
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,920
care about the reports and the blogs

356
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,760
that we write are they finding value can

357
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,519
they take action from it so that is like

358
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,760
the framework we use to go about doing

359
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,160
our work

360
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,560
and when we talk about analyzing linux

361
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,959
intrusions obviously mitre attack heavy

362
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,680
um this is just a few examples uh you

363
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,440
know from a command line perspective

364
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,720
this is an actual intrusion that we

365
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,639
observed where the adversary was looking

366
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,399
at docker information so you'll see

367
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,120
things like you know execution and you

368
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,360
know container administration commands

369
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,320
uh defense evasion it is popular every

370
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
adversary is trying to evade defenses in

371
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,480
some form or another the good ones know

372
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,800
that you probably have some sort of edr

373
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,480
you probably have some sort of tooling

374
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,200
so you see things like modifying files

375
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,839
to become executable remo indicator

376
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,639
removal on host clearing logs and then

377
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,880
discovery every adversary has to conduct

378
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,120
discovery because when they get on a box

379
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,880
it's high probability they don't know

380
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,000
where they are they don't know what

381
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,600
account they're operating under unless

382
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,120
they're using compromise credentials and

383
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,079
even then they may not know the

384
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,000
permissions around those credentials so

385
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,440
they're going to conduct some sort of

386
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
discovery remote system discovery you

387
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,839
know this uh this dot slash daemon is a

388
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,760
renamed tool that was a network scanning

389
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,120
tool so they wanted to see what other

390
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,040
hosts are connected and what ports are

391
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,959
open and then since they were looking at

392
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,560
containers they wanted to see what

393
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,000
docker images were on that box looking

394
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
for a specific version which is pretty

395
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,160
interesting

396
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,760
so that was really just like a whistle

397
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,480
stop tool a tour of how we kind of are

398
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,959
tracking the matador of intrusions

399
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,279
oh no it wasn't sorry i'm a slight ahead

400
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,920
no it's okay um yeah so

401
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
there are a lot of challenges in

402
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,440
analyzing intrusions in general but

403
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,839
specifically when it comes to linux the

404
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,800
telemetry is very different from windows

405
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,880
our customer base is heavily windows so

406
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,800
our sensor is

407
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,720
very good at windows

408
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,560
it's catching up on linux but that

409
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,800
brings challenges to our team you know

410
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,200
especially process lineage understanding

411
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,360
who spawned what what is the grandparent

412
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,279
process or a child process it is not as

413
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,160
easy to do with the linux side of things

414
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,760
but on the reverse side where we've kind

415
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,320
of gone in we're seeing kind of

416
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,600
patterns where

417
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,279
where the malicious activity is

418
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,360
originating what the next steps are and

419
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,959
we're kind of able to pre-anticipate

420
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,639
that and build out

421
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,000
um more

422
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,440
more detects more patterns in order to

423
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
kind of say okay they've done this what

424
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,600
might happen next and we can kind of you

425
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,279
never want to assume but we can start

426
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,720
assuming and say all right i've never

427
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,639
seen this command line before but based

428
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,959
on what i know about these intrusions

429
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,360
what might the purpose behind this be

430
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,680
and you you can kind of start digging

431
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,440
into that and pulling on the thread to

432
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,920
to learn more as you go along yeah and

433
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,839
it there's a very high noise to signal

434
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,519
ratio everything's a file everything's

435
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,120
touching you know when you when you kick

436
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,040
off make scripts just stuff explodes

437
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,279
right and all of that is logged and so

438
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,440
so working through that understanding

439
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,120
what is human driven versus what it

440
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,360
automated versus what is regular system

441
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,880
operations can be pretty challenging

442
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,760
equally it means that we capture a lot

443
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,800
and we get to see a lot so we you you

444
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,079
can when you're digging into something

445
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,079
like linux which is much more of a wow

446
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,600
we find it much more verbose when we're

447
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,079
looking through things um

448
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,600
you tend to see more of that kind of

449
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,959
novel tradecraft there's stuff that you

450
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,040
think damn that's interesting like why

451
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,440
are they doing this um

452
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,120
so it's kind of a double assured while

453
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,040
it's noisy you kind of

454
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,279
get to pull out those more interesting

455
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,199
nuggets that you're like huh i learned

456
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,519
something new today awesome how can i

457
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,680
take this forward how can i bring this

458
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,560
uh

459
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,320
bring this into the next case that i

460
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,760
work the next intrusion i'm running

461
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,600
through what does this give me going

462
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,440
forward yeah and then and then lastly on

463
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,519
the challenges side of things you know

464
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,120
what distribution are they running what

465
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,880
kernel is running

466
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,720
as you are well aware we have a skills

467
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,480
gap in the cyber security community as

468
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,199
it is and on top of that there's a linux

469
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,279
skills gap in the security community so

470
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,759
having folks threat hunters researchers

471
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,480
who are comfortable and able to dig into

472
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,320
that activity and not only that but

473
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,759
identify what's important and build

474
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,199
hunting triggers we're still building

475
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,800
out that you know

476
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,320
part of the research but on the flip

477
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,399
side so the adversaries we still see

478
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,720
like we've started looking into it

479
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,800
recently like how often help commands

480
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,120
get run when we were looking at linda

481
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,120
windows a windows intrusion versus the

482
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,199
linux and far and away we see it more

483
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,600
often in linux where you know you get a

484
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,759
h because they're still feeling their

485
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,519
way around and figuring out what they're

486
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,519
doing too

487
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,600
so now i'm in the right place um

488
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,279
we've talked about the kind of metadata

489
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,639
we're tracking we've tried to go through

490
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,959
a high level and what we've seen just by

491
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,040
doing this for the last couple of years

492
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,279
um are a few notable things so firstly

493
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,480
um

494
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,880
we've seen the percentage of intrusions

495
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,120
that are actually based on linux devices

496
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,880
we've seen that nearly double as a

497
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,240
percentage of all the intrusions we've

498
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,680
looked at over

499
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,720
between 2020 and 2021

500
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,880
don't have a huge reason for that um

501
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,000
other than you know

502
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,240
the adversaries are kind of moving to

503
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,759
the space where everyone is operating

504
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,680
they're getting more comfortable also

505
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,120
our telemetry is getting better as

506
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,880
justin already hinted at

507
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,959
um the smaller little pie charts there

508
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,920
show the makeup of that intrusion data

509
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,440
data which is actually a little bit more

510
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,519
interesting we can see white is

511
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,440
representing state nexus adversaries so

512
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,959
targeted adversaries people that we

513
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,279
believe are acting on

514
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,400
with espionage motivations versus

515
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,640
e-crime adversaries which is the blue

516
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,319
and you can see there is a teeny shift

517
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,959
between 2020 and 2021

518
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,640
just showing that the balance is tipping

519
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,199
between the two in 2021 we kind of

520
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,119
pulled on that thread and we're like oh

521
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,359
there's more crypto mining going on this

522
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,880
is just another avenue of looking for

523
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,599
profit um and it was just like by

524
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,039
looking at it on the ground scale we

525
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,240
could go okay well what actually

526
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,400
happened in these intrusions oh okay

527
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,720
it's crypto miners cool we can do

528
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,240
something with that yeah one thing to

529
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,400
note on this is there's two two pieces

530
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,000
one is in 2020 we observed 660

531
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,240
hands-on keyboard intrusions in 2021 i

532
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,559
think we're at 958

533
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,320
this this is obviously a visibility bias

534
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,160
right it's within our customer base so

535
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,919
this these numbers are skewed by the

536
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,440
types of customers we have the types of

537
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,200
environments that they we have but still

538
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,559
i mean the trending over time is is

539
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,760
pretty valuable

540
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,720
cool

541
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,799
and then we bring that down to the

542
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,120
technique level these are the top 11

543
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,200
because apparently we can't count to 10.

544
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,280
and 11 techniques that we've been seeing

545
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,480
across

546
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,039
intrusions for i think the first half of

547
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,200
this year some of them are kind of

548
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,120
obvious so unique shell obviously we're

549
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,600
talking about linux boxes almost always

550
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,840
there's going to be some kind of

551
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,679
linux shell used although we are seeing

552
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,000
trends of things like python being used

553
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,559
for execution for establishing backdoors

554
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,400
some of these pair really well together

555
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
so obviously exploit the public facing

556
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,520
application

557
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,039
drop a web shell get your persistence

558
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,160
straight away

559
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,679
and some of the ones that stand out and

560
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,840
have surprised us is

561
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,080
one not surprise i guess that is just

562
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,080
more notable when we compare this to say

563
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,120
our windows data set is the amount of um

564
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,880
defensive asian in terms of clearing

565
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,240
logs clearing

566
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,080
files and just actual cleanup happening

567
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,520
on the system it's a trend that we've

568
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,720
seen

569
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,559
um for the last couple of years and it

570
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,640
just whether it's more accessible we're

571
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,640
unsure but it just seems to happen more

572
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,200
frequently

573
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,919
and then justin mentioned looking at

574
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,080
this data as a heat map so this is a

575
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,320
side by side from q1 last year to q1

576
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,360
this year

577
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,960
and it just kind of illustrates that by

578
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,039
tracking things at that higher level we

579
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,919
can kind of really quickly see okay

580
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,200
valid accounts that seems to have

581
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,720
dropped down for the first quarter of

582
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,919
this year in favor of indicator removal

583
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,360
why like

584
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,039
again we haven't necessarily got that

585
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,840
answer but we're just seeing it kind of

586
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,440
progress through time and it gives us

587
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
that historic look back to say okay

588
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,840
adversaries in 2022

589
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,760
are doing this and then we can kind of

590
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,520
drill down a bit further into the

591
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,440
command lines and go okay exactly how

592
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,520
are they doing this

593
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,600
which is now on to

594
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,120
the fun part which is our case study

595
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,120
where justin's going to walk us through

596
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,640
how we've mapped the situation and one

597
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,400
last note on this slide before we move

598
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,200
is

599
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,840
what this also does is allows us to

600
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,679
focus our research and development

601
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,160
efforts if we see adversaries uptick in

602
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
a certain tactic right or maybe a

603
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,039
specific technique uh we we go and check

604
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,200
are our hunting triggers commensurate

605
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
with that type of activity are we do we

606
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,440
have enough visibility there to ensure

607
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,880
that we're catching that you know if

608
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,159
they're ramping up their operations

609
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,240
within that tactic

610
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,720
so and yes so now to talk about a case

611
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,640
study so this is an actual hands-on

612
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,559
keyboard intrusion that we observed i'm

613
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,679
going to walk you through a little bit

614
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,760
of what we saw kind of

615
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,280
maybe you'll get to see how we do things

616
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
and how we process this

617
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,799
so

618
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,120
here we have an unknown actor who gained

619
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,440
access to a linux system i'm not sure i

620
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,720
don't remember exactly how this was i

621
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,280
think this was exploiting a public web

622
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,039
facing application

623
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,320
but we're going to see them conduct

624
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,240
discovery collection and command control

625
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,000
so in the first case they are running

626
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,640
find looking for file names you know

627
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,320
star dot properties

628
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,640
maybe configurations uh trying to

629
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,000
understand what's on the system and

630
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,280
different properties oftentimes there

631
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,159
may be

632
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,400
unique system details and configurations

633
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,120
uh package information maybe credentials

634
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,880
so they run that command and we'll tag

635
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,039
that with you know 1083 file and

636
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,880
directory discovery

637
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,240
all right cool they found the file that

638
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,440
they were looking for

639
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,440
uh tomcatlogging.properties

640
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,720
all right that's of interest to them i

641
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,200
guess so they you know write that out to

642
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,120
standard out and we'll call that data

643
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,240
from local system they're pulling

644
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,039
something from the local file system

645
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,960
so here we see them decide you know what

646
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,640
i'm going to go get a piece of tooling

647
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,320
and bring it down to the system so we

648
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,240
have them run wgit to what is likely a

649
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,880
compromised wordpress website

650
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,960
and they're grabbing frpc which is fast

651
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,720
reverse proxy

652
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,480
so they go and they get it

653
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,720
or do they

654
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,480
looking at that second line they forgot

655
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,159
something so as amy pointed out

656
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,360
adversaries may not always be

657
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,280
comfortable they may be in a rush

658
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,600
they're humans just like us oh man we

659
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,520
forgot to check to you know tag it with

660
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,919
no check certificate so it failed so

661
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,360
they're going to run that again oh

662
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,200
awesome it downloads so we have ingress

663
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,919
tool transfer t1105 but what's

664
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,919
interesting as well is like just by

665
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,679
looking for that last part the no check

666
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,600
certificate we can start saying okay how

667
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,280
many other intrusions did the adversary

668
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,360
fail in this way it was this the same

669
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,600
adversary is this just something that is

670
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,919
a gap for them does this make a signal

671
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,840
probably not given the the legitimate

672
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,120
applications of this but it's an

673
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,960
interesting thing for us to take away

674
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,440
and pull them

675
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,120
all right so now that they've got their

676
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,440
tooling all right let's run our tooling

677
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,240
so dot will slash frbc with the

678
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,799
configuration file everything's great

679
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,799
right

680
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,880
next one

681
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,039
oh man i forgot to set it to executable

682
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,520
so now you see the adversary chmod plus

683
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,600
x the frpc tool so that they can

684
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,360
actually execute it again they're humans

685
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,600
they make mistakes so in this case we're

686
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,120
going to tag it with permissions

687
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,039
modification linux and mac file

688
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,720
directory permissions modification which

689
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,159
is t1222 subtechnique02.

690
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,600
all right let's execute it this time

691
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,679
it's executable let's run it so they do

692
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,559
run it

693
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,840
however

694
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,120
the tooling on the endpoint actually

695
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,520
prevents it from executing so they

696
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,760
thought they had it fixed it's not fixed

697
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,720
all right well you know what if you're

698
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,320
not gonna let my tools run i'm just

699
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,480
gonna set up a reverse shell and and do

700
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,159
it the old-fashioned way so we see them

701
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,440
run bash dash i pipe it to dev tcp uh

702
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,840
over port 99.99 so we're going to tag

703
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,679
that with non-standard port because you

704
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,080
know that's not a standard port

705
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,240
again the tooling on the box prevents

706
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,760
that from running now they're a little

707
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,679
frustrated all right i'm going to run

708
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,280
shell.elf

709
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,720
you know i'm going to run a binary make

710
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,320
this work so

711
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,880
cool command is scripting interpreter

712
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,640
t1059

713
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,240
tooling stops it again

714
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,480
so now you know what i'm done

715
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,640
remove the shell file i'm out of here

716
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,320
they actually took a day off and then

717
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,960
they came back the next day um due to

718
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,240
the fact that we're running on time i

719
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,679
want to leave time for questions we

720
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,520
won't cover the second day but this is

721
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,200
kind of just a quick summary of what we

722
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,960
do every day we are looking through

723
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,919
these

724
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,760
line by line event by event

725
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,360
understanding how the adversary is

726
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,799
operating right they want to get on they

727
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,400
need to discover what's going on they

728
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,159
want to set up persistence so another

729
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,760
foothold behind you know besides the one

730
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,039
they already have especially when you

731
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,120
talk about public-facing expo you know

732
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,640
that application they don't know if it's

733
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,520
gonna get patched they don't know if

734
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,960
their exploit's gonna fail so they wanna

735
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,799
set up a proxy set up a reverse shell

736
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,400
whatever they can to maintain a foothold

737
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,840
on that box while they continue to

738
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,360
conduct other operations

739
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,840
so again i i think it's all about why

740
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,120
are we doing this and what are we

741
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,520
learning from it so for us tracking of

742
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,039
things in a consistent manner it just

743
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,039
gives us that stable point to go from

744
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,240
and to then

745
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,559
go back draw out the hypothesis

746
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,799
ask more questions ask about our gaps

747
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,159
document them

748
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,080
improve um

749
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,640
as i kind of already hinted at alluded

750
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,360
to

751
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,279
um you can identify changes in adversary

752
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,720
behavior and you can start asking the

753
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,480
questions why like we

754
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,039
don't normally look at why because we

755
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,799
then pass that to our clever folks in

756
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,240
intel um

757
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,400
who may well have the the wider world

758
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,080
viewing can say oh yeah this has just

759
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,840
happened which is why they're doing this

760
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,919
but it all builds a big picture that

761
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,440
then feeds back into that frontline

762
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,520
threat hunting team and we can say hey

763
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,679
guys this is now going on this is what

764
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,840
we got from our intrusion data this is

765
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,960
the kind of

766
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,640
area to start focusing in on if we're

767
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,200
not already

768
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
using a standardized framework we can

769
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,960
talk about all of our intrusions from

770
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,480
the same point of reference which helps

771
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,159
not just with sort of internal

772
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,679
communication and knowledge management

773
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,880
but also

774
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,880
with external facing communication like

775
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,159
it's really nice to be able to go to a

776
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,840
customer and say hey

777
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,120
here is

778
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,720
this is what happened here is how we're

779
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,159
following this through

780
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,000
um and here's what this actually means

781
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,279
to you and by the way here are some like

782
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,880
go away have a look at my here are some

783
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,320
suggested controls that you may want to

784
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,840
consider putting in

785
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,400
and see if this works for you and

786
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,000
obviously there's a benefit of just

787
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,679
visualizing things quite quickly like

788
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,360
looking and seeing what was

789
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,880
that historic look back what was

790
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,159
different

791
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,760
six months ago a week ago a day ago why

792
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,159
is this uh why is this changing why is

793
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,400
it shifting yeah so question before for

794
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,520
you guys how many folks use miter attack

795
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,520
regularly

796
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,960
oh that's a good that's a good number of

797
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,559
hands that's that's why we try to

798
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,320
leverage that is because you know it's a

799
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,480
it's a pretty commonly known framework

800
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,520
um how many find miter attack actionable

801
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,080
less hands interesting i did not expect

802
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,360
less hands

803
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,480
um

804
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,640
okay that's good feedback um because we

805
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,360
talked to miter folks and we try to

806
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,240
submit um so

807
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,159
i may have questions for some of you

808
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,640
after the fact

809
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,960
cool and i think unless you've got any

810
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,720
further points i think really it's just

811
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,320
about

812
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,640
it's about knowledge management right

813
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,720
no we already said no intrusion is a

814
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,559
single event every intrusion is a

815
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,159
combination of events that leads to an

816
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,200
incident

817
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,320
um so it's about having that centralized

818
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,480
kind of knowledge management areas so

819
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,919
that when we're looking into things we

820
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,360
can say okay

821
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,400
today we tagged this command line as os

822
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,559
credential dumping and here's why

823
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,960
um and then you know a new a new joiner

824
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,720
to the team looks it and goes oh wow

825
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,159
i've seen this and you can go yeah go

826
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,840
and look at the go and look at this

827
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,159
former intrusion same thing or oh okay

828
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,679
that's different let's dig into that

829
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:12,880
further and

830
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,760
um and learn more from it

831
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,720
and with that we did promise to finish

832
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,880
a sort of bang on time so we can get

833
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,960
people to bear but

834
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,200
very questions

835
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:36,799
[Applause]

836
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,919
so cultural menisci um

837
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,159
have you actually had experiences of

838
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,360
actually

839
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,390
collaborating with say other

840
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,600
[Music]

841
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,200
threat intel

842
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,080
companies on actually exchanging

843
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,360
information about uh

844
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,000
adversary activities in in this same

845
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,159
format so are the uh are your

846
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,960
observations i would say

847
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,600
compatible in a way that they can be you

848
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,279
compared with other

849
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,799
providers and then you can actually

850
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,520
collaborate on this area interesting um

851
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,919
so from an intel perspective

852
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,960
that's not our team i will say that we

853
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,279
work closely with intel we share our

854
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,640
research and reporting that goes into

855
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,720
the intel reports we do work closely

856
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,120
with the mitre attack team

857
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,919
we

858
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:26,640
we

859
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,399
submit new techniques as we observe them

860
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,919
to try and you know improve the miter

861
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,080
attack framework uh we understand that

862
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,360
there are a lot of times where something

863
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,360
may not fit right or we'll observe a new

864
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,120
technique when it comes to sharing with

865
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,799
other threat intel orgs

866
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,039
um outside of what falcon x does the

867
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,640
intel team which i can't speak to you

868
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,559
know our team really is heavily engaged

869
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,039
with mitre

870
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,000
all right thanks for your talk um eric

871
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,799
julian from octa um this question is

872
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,720
kind of what you had just mentioned at

873
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,440
the end so like so we use so in our

874
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,840
detections we'll add the miter technique

875
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,200
to it just to

876
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,159
i don't know tag it or whatnot but

877
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,520
like what

878
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,360
like your question of who finds an

879
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,760
actionable like i don't actually know

880
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,640
what to do with the technique once i've

881
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,200
tagged it or with it so what do you guys

882
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,919
do yeah so um that's that's a really

883
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,720
good point so what we do internally is

884
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,159
we align

885
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,159
um essentially our

886
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,520
our research and development for our

887
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,000
hunting triggers with what we observe in

888
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,960
terms of

889
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,320
frequent

890
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,840
techniques and tactics right we want to

891
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,600
make sure that what we're observing we

892
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
have coverage for and that's where i've

893
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,520
seen and even in previous organizations

894
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,640
where i've worked where i've seen that

895
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,960
used is when you do a detection coverage

896
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,240
analysis do i have gaps to have

897
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,600
visibilities whether it's in my data

898
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,120
sources my telemetry or my actual

899
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,559
signatures

900
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,159
a lot of people will use the miter

901
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,559
framework as that baseline build out a

902
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,480
heat map and say okay stuff is happening

903
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,919
here adversaries are using this

904
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,760
technique or you know this tactic is

905
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,600
heavily populated do i have coverage

906
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,679
there do i have visibility there um

907
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,440
miter attack you can go to the website

908
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,039
and view the data sources for each

909
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,559
technique so if you don't have

910
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,159
visibility or if you're lacking data you

911
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,520
can go in and determine what type of

912
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,919
data sources telemetry might i need um

913
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,679
to actually go and either hunt for or

914
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,960
detect on that so what do you do with a

915
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,640
i guess a somewhat generic technique

916
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,799
like like persistence if i got a windows

917
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,679
box i mean there's several registry keys

918
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,919
there's you know different directories

919
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,720
linux you know cron

920
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,919
mac so

921
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,600
so that one technique might have

922
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,120
5 10 15 different ways to detect on it

923
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,679
so i could have i could say hey i've got

924
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,840
a detection and so yeah it's green

925
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,840
that's good yeah but there could you

926
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,200
could be missing so many other things so

927
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,080
how do you deal with that yeah so um as

928
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,760
i mentioned earlier the tool that we're

929
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,919
working on internally is going to allow

930
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,279
us to uh tag those command lines to

931
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,799
those techniques so that we can start to

932
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,279
then do the analysis of which command

933
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,760
line arguments or which tooling uh is

934
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,120
most frequently occurring with this

935
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,640
technique you know so like you said os

936
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,039
credential dumping lsas you have mimi

937
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,720
cats you have procdump you have all

938
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,120
these different type ways to achieve it

939
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,200
and so we want to get down to which is

940
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,279
the technique most frequently used by an

941
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,200
adversary or by another e-crime

942
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,440
adversary targeted adversary

943
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,399
that's where

944
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,840
you know because you can't cover all the

945
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,200
iterations now mitre did help with the

946
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,720
sub techniques it does make things a

947
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,960
little bit better um but we're still

948
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,799
trying to figure out exactly like if i

949
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,000
have a green box does that mean i'm

950
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,440
great well

951
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,159
maybe partly you know just adversaries

952
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,039
are so

953
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,720
good at coming up with new ways to do

954
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,320
things and so that's part of why we do

955
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,840
what we do is because chances are in

956
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,799
that intrusion there's a technique that

957
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,399
an implementation of a technique that we

958
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,760
may not have yet observed and we want to

959
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,600
document that and then go back to the

960
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,120
hunters and say hey

961
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,960
did you see this well you know in their

962
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,320
hunting cube probably not right they got

963
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,240
to catch it move on the next bad guy do

964
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,919
we need to develop a trigger for this

965
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,360
all right thanks yeah thank you for the

966
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,600
questions

967
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,440
so we have quite some time left for

968
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,840
questions

969
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,880
i think they want beer

970
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,880
so one of the questions that i have is

971
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,960
along with the overwatch uh that you

972
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,919
mentioned is giving you all data

973
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,399
do you guys go much more detail into

974
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,720
collecting auditory data and epbf

975
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,399
related data tracking each and every

976
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,480
syscalls and you know

977
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,080
what what details his calls do have and

978
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,880
matching those calls along with uh you

979
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,440
know tactics and techniques uh

980
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,120
in might attack framework and coming

981
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,440
back and looking at it like or or the

982
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,279
overwatch itself is enough to give you

983
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,200
all the details uh for each and every

984
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,840
like loading of uh modules in memory and

985
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,880
you know

986
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,519
all those things

987
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,799
okay go for it um yeah so from uh from a

988
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,720
data perspective correct we use the

989
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,960
sensor uh and the sensor has all of

990
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,880
those i think there's like a hundred

991
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,440
some metadata events um that are pulled

992
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,440
from it so we don't look at the logging

993
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,600
we look at the actual events the

994
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,279
executions and the loading of modules

995
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,279
the loading of curls on from the sensor

996
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,679
event itself so the sensor event covers

997
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,440
all of those activity

998
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,960
for us so it gives us that granular

999
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,640
visibility where we don't have to pull

1000
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,080
because we don't want to pull logs back

1001
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,519
from a customer employer we just want

1002
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,440
the sensor to pull back its own

1003
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,120
data sources

1004
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,360
okay and like

1005
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,200
like how do you manage the data like is

1006
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,720
it sensor filtering everything for you

1007
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,640
because the amount of data that

1008
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,519
comes in uh is is mind-boggling like oh

1009
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,039
yeah

1010
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,200
yeah i think it's something like we we

1011
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,640
quote something like seven trillion

1012
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,880
events a week which is uh it's

1013
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,039
inconceivable to my brain um but a lot

1014
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,000
of it is based on um we do apply like a

1015
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,080
lot of statistical modeling and machine

1016
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,440
learning to that to kind of bring it

1017
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,480
down to

1018
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,120
data sets that are a more

1019
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,880
human accessible we'll look for things

1020
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,960
like bursts of activity happening

1021
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,720
together that just don't fit anything

1022
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,519
else

1023
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,679
um and trying to distill that down and

1024
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,120
that's what our hunters will use but

1025
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,000
then we get everything

1026
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,919
so the the stuff that maybe wasn't

1027
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,440
clustered together

1028
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,199
we then have to go back and pick through

1029
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,239
that or

1030
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,079
we pick through it just to see like well

1031
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,800
what could have been clustered next time

1032
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,440
okay thanks

1033
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,839
so any more questions

1034
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,560
seems

1035
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,199
everybody is eager for beer so let's

1036
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,280
thank the speakers again and wish you a

1037
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,839
nice evening everybody

1038
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,240
you
