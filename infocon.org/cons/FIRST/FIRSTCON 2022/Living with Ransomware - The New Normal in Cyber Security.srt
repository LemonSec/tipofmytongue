00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,239
winter

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,399

and thanks for coming and

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,280
well i guess there's worse things that

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,680
could happen like booking your flights

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,520
with the australian national carrier

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,560
qantas

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,760
which my colleague and my quote speaker

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,680
john did and uh

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,920
he's not here today right so i got

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,360
cancelled last minute

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,320
so

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,240
it's gonna be just me

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,479
all right let's get into it

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,320
a quick intro as you can see uh

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,119
john couldn't make it

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,400
his flight golf cancel last minute

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,720
my name is vishal tucker i'm the senior

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,400
director for dfir

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,799
at the ankura dfir practice in australia

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,920
uh quick look through the agenda

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,680
we'll have a look at current ransomware

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,680
threat landscape the ransomware groups

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,439
that are active right now and what

46
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,960
motivates them

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,920
how to manage attacks real world cases

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,680
we'll dig into that couple of cases

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,040
we've got and

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,560
detection forensics best practices

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,479
insurance policy is very important

52
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,399
communication strategies again one of

53
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,038
the most important aspects of managing

54
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,720
ransomware attacks and

55
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,840
some resources for you

56
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,440
before i start just quickly

57
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,080
the title of the slide

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,040
as you can see sounds familiar um

59
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,200
ransomware has been around for for quite

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,920
quite a while now but uh i remember way

61
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,440
back in 2012 2013 um

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,000
we had a big incident and we were

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,599
brainstorming the whole team was there

64
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,120
and one of the senior

65
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,599
consultant just goes uh come on guys

66
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,280
just ran somewhere it's just a fair

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,000
it'll go away

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
as we all know it didn't go away it's

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,959
just evolved into something

70
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,360
much much bigger today and

71
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,840
it's just something that i don't see as

72
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,360
going away we'll just have to live with

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,760
it uh just like covid

74
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,080
uh we'll have to manage it and make sure

75
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,920
we can get through all these attacks as

76
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,800
best as we can

77
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,879
quick look at the current ransomware

78
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,200
landscape there's a as you as you must

79
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,360
know there's a lot of ransomware groups

80
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,840
operating at the moment

81
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,480
a lot of the targets of these as again

82
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,560
we all know uh our businesses and they

83
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,080
don't discriminate they just target

84
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,360
everyone but from a real world

85
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,760
scenario what we see a lot of it is um

86
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,159
they target individuals small businesses

87
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,760
a lot of energy like pretty much

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,200
everyone really

89
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,920
uh in the recent years we've seen a lot

90
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,720
of attacks on healthcare i

91
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,640
most of you in ireland would know that

92
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,879
last year you had a pretty big

93
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,360
incident with your healthcare

94
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
we've seen quite a few as well in

95
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,200
australia

96
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,440
supply chain attacks government

97
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,720
education

98
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,080
they're targeting basically everyone

99
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,760
there's just too many of them but

100
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,080
obviously the main players are riville

101
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,000
conti

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,799
fabric dark side

103
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,439
with ransomware payments

104
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,239
unfortunately we see them going up

105
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,400
they're literally just

106
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,560
breaking records every every year i

107
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,400
pulled this uh off the internet

108
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,000
just a couple of days back and as you

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,639
can see it's uh it's really i don't see

110
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,000
i don't think if you i don't i don't

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,680
know if you can read the numbers there

112
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,440
but that it's literally running into

113
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,479
millions of dollars now

114
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,080
what's the motivation and the the how do

115
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,840
they operate let's have a quick look at

116
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,680
it um obviously money is the biggest

117
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,479
motivation for these guys um

118
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,720
they're literally after money as much as

119
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,400
they can

120
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,639
some we see um doing it just to disrupt

121
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,840
things cause a lot of disruptions

122
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,520
as you can see there her headline there

123
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,199
it was not designed to make money

124
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,000
they

125
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,600
literally want to bring companies down

126
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,560
at some some sometimes and they also

127
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,120
target government

128
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,960
installations and the like

129
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,440
not much but we also see

130
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,479
some of them testing their their arsenal

131
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,000
experimenting

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,759
some pretty big

133
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,039
incidents have happened in the past

134
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,320
where

135
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,840
literally they were not after anything

136
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,600
it was just testing or

137
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,720
you know experimentation

138
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,800
the the way they operate mostly that we

139
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,840
see is a big trend going towards um

140
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,600
ransomware as a service

141
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,199
which is um

142
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,919
makes it really easy for anyone to jump

143
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,000
on the ransomware

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,800
bandwagon and start you know

145
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,400
extorting money out of

146
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,240
victims

147
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,880
some bigger gangs

148
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,039
threat actors have also

149
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,479
traditionally built their own in-house

150
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,880
products uh and a lot of them actually

151
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,039
end up selling the product to whoever is

152
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,120
willing to pay for it

153
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,280
we'll touch on some real world scenarios

154
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,360
a bit later in the slides but we've also

155
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,440
seen a trend where

156
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,560
recently

157
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,000
where a lot of these actors are going

158
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,280
after

159
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,080
encryption but also pivoting on to

160
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,720
extortion as in like you know encryption

161
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,080
is there but if you if you if you

162
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,240
got a really good backup system or

163
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,319
you don't want to pay for whatever

164
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,199
reason

165
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,639
they'll they'll threaten you with

166
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,639
extortion or basically threatening to

167
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,560
expose your data your

168
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,880
whatever they've stolen making it public

169
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,880
and making you look really bad um and

170
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,720
we'll see that and one of the real world

171
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,960
examples as well

172
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,919
this slide is uh got a lot of content um

173
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,520
so i'll just pick a couple of important

174
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,240
things from it um uh we got a kind that

175
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,440
blitzed through the whole thing we only

176
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,840
got a half an hour but just just so you

177
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,199
know i'll be around feel free to

178
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,280
approach me and ask anything if you want

179
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,599
when talking about ransomware attacks a

180
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,560
lot of

181
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,520
it actually goes on

182
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,440
before the actual attack there's a lot

183
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,479
of preparation

184
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,199
that

185
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,800
companies and organizations should

186
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,880
usually get into

187
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,120
as you can see in the slides i i reckon

188
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,199
one of the main ones that i want to

189
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,759
stress on is tabletop exercises

190
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,680
if you haven't done one it's highly

191
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,120
recommended you

192
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,240
do one

193
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,800
most probably

194
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,599
maybe get a third party

195
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,919
third party company to get it done for

196
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,120
you

197
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,960
the main

198
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,680
benefit of doing tabletops is it exposes

199
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,919
some stuff while you're doing it that

200
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,000
you could have could have never really

201
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,080
thought of

202
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,039
and

203
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,199
once it's there you can fix it it's

204
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,639
really really helpful

205
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,720
and also another aspect of it that's

206
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,720
really good is the communication

207
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,199
strategies you can get a lot out of

208
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,919
these top tabletop exercises that you

209
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,840
can then use to

210
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,440
build really good communication

211
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,560
strategies going forward

212
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,360
during the attack while it's going uh

213
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,280
it's quite stressful but

214
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,440
i think a couple of points

215
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
like coordination between different

216
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,160
teams different people helps a lot if

217
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,520
you can

218
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,919
do it in a calm and collected way that

219
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,840
that'll really really help you manage

220
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,080
the tag while it's going on

221
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,160
communication is also really really

222
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,440
important

223
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,000
as long as the people who need to know

224
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,560
certain things do

225
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,000
know it it really helps you

226
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,759
get through the whole incident as

227
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,519
painlessly as possible

228
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,640
and obviously there's a phase after

229
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,479
the actual incident has occurred and

230
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,799
you've contained it

231
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,120
basically it really helps a lot if you

232
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,919
can

233
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,600
do a quick

234
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,000
root cause analysis

235
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,839
lots of learnings come out of it and

236
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:50,880
help you

237
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,399
you know manage these attacks in the

238
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,360
future

239
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,800
and obviously there's a lot of stuff in

240
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,399
there as you can see the last point is

241
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,240
uh all the points and before so

242
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,640
basically you have to go back to uh

243
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,399
getting ready for

244
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,040
whatever the next attack would be like

245
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,320
uh let's touch on a couple of real world

246
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,600
examples um uh we we deal with a lot of

247
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,399
um

248
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,160
unfortunately a lot of ransomware

249
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,920
attacks on a day-to-day basis there's a

250
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,839
lot of people are affected by it

251
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,519
we uh worked with a freight company um

252
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,680
not so long ago um it was really

253
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,279
interesting um

254
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,320
uh

255
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,920
responding to that incident because we

256
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,160
found so much stuff that really opened

257
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,839
our eyes to

258
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,120
how complicated these attacks can be

259
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,640
basically what we found was these

260
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,959
tradactors had exploited their network

261
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,120
back in 2020

262
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,600
they had been in there for quite a long

263
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,640
time

264
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,959
before the actual ransomware attack

265
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,200
occurred which makes us believe it

266
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,880
probably wasn't even the same guys they

267
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,560
probably just sold it off to

268
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,240
some ransomware threat actors

269
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,519
it was

270
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,600
left exposed for a long time and they

271
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
came in they were literally coming in

272
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,880
and going out as they wished

273
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,320
they

274
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,240
ended up at some point installing mega

275
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,600
sync which is a utility to backup

276
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,200
files and they actually used it to

277
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,959
exfiltrate a lot of data from the from

278
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,560
the customer

279
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,800
and they

280
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,079
did

281
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,760
threaten to

282
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,600
expose that basically at the end of the

283
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,000
and we're not exactly sure if it was the

284
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,880
same threat actors or some that they

285
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,800
sold access to other people but once

286
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,399
everything was taken out of their

287
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,399
networks they literally just

288
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,480
encrypted everything and uh at that

289
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,680
point it was

290
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,120
yeah that's when we came in and we saw

291
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,959
all of this stuff

292
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,959
interesting um look at this so it's

293
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,640
definitely not one of those um

294
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,440
you know

295
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,240
grab and uh sorry crash and grab style

296
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,920
ransomware attacks we see normally uh

297
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
this looks like it was going on for a

298
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,120
long time

299
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,800
uh another one that i want to talk about

300
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,399
quickly is evolve from that we helped

301
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,320
them

302
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,079
they used proxy log on which is

303
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,079
something that came out

304
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,760
not that long ago

305
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,680
vulnerability in exchange servers and

306
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,360
they basically use that vulnerability to

307
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,959
get in they

308
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,480
dropped friends somewhere on the network

309
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,360
they executed it and we also found a lot

310
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,240
of prone jobs that were scheduled

311
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,000
that were staggered

312
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,240
in a way where

313
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,480
it just kept going on um bit by bit by

314
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,959
bit and kept uh spreading through

315
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,959
through through the entire network um

316
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,560
through chrome jobs

317
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,279
and

318
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,079
the interesting thing about this was

319
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,480
they kept lowering the ransomware demand

320
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,839
basically and they were like okay you

321
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,360
can't give us that much how about this

322
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,000
much come on give us something at least

323
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,440
that was quite interesting to see them

324
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,440
go down their path and we'll just tell

325
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,440
you you know everything's up for

326
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
negotiations there

327
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,839
detection is probably one of the most

328
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,519
important

329
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,519
steps in in preparing yourself for

330
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,120
ransomware

331
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,720
it is not the easiest but if you can

332
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,399
get it done somehow

333
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,320
it would really really help you

334
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,959
contain the spread and

335
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,880
will basically prepare yourself that

336
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,639
much better

337
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,720
you can have in-house detection teams if

338
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,480
you can if you're you know a company

339
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,720
they can afford to have in-house if not

340
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,760
then you can

341
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,320
subscribe to threat intel feeds that's

342
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,040
probably easier where you know you just

343
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,959
get all these feeds from companies that

344
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,880
actually do all the research and once

345
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,079
you have these few

346
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,000
feeds you can use these feeds to create

347
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,480
detections inside of your own network

348
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,279
and

349
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,279
we'll basically tell if something's not

350
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,720
right or you know

351
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,440
at least contain the damage

352
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,200
there's a lot of research publications a

353
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,279
lot of people publish

354
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,120
articles publish their research they do

355
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,440
one ransomware and as you can see a

356
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,279
couple of images up there you can use

357
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,200
these um

358
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,040
commands that are run by the ransomware

359
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,920
and

360
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,639
their behavioral

361
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,680
techniques to create detections and

362
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,120
implement them throughout your network

363
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,959
that will really help you once you know

364
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,279
these things start getting executed on

365
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,040
your network you can catch them

366
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,560
early on

367
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,680
and

368
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,120
just a quick side note there's a lot of

369
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,560
edr

370
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,240
solutions nowadays that you can use

371
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,800
these detections on as well basically

372
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,560
you know they keep monitoring your

373
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,000
endpoints and if they see something like

374
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,120
that happen

375
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,839
they will take actions that you can then

376
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,000
you can set up basically to stop the

377
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,600
execution or take take different actions

378
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
basically

379
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,440
uh let's have a quick look at some

380
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,160
forensics best practices that

381
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,199
we

382
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,959
end up recommending to to all our

383
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,560
clients when we when we're dealing with

384
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,839
ransomware incidents

385
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,360
as we know most of the infrastructure

386
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,760
now is on virtual machines and it's

387
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,320
really helpful for people like us

388
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,160
like all of us when we go in to respond

389
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,199
to incidents

390
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,639
if

391
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,399
the victims have got some snapshots

392
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,320
ideally it's really good to have the

393
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,399
current snapshots which is not a big

394
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,440
problem but also before the infection a

395
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,040
lot of times

396
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,680
we see it unfortunately they don't have

397
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,079
the snapshots from before the

398
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,240
infection and that really doesn't helps

399
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,240
us when all you're looking at is uh

400
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,399
encrypted files not much you can do with

401
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,240
that at that point in time

402
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,880
so it's really good if you can have

403
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,279
something set up where you are

404
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,120
regularly taking

405
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,079
snapshots of your machines

406
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,959
and

407
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:44,240
having like storing them somewhere um

408
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,199
available logs um it's it's probably the

409
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,720
next best thing

410
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,440
logs can tell us a lot about

411
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,000
what happened what was in initial

412
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,720
infection vector how did they get in

413
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,800
the reason these things are needed is

414
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,639
because a lot of times you'd find when

415
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,600
you go making a claim

416
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,680
with your insurance company they would

417
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,079
usually ask for this

418
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,519
this information

419
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,360
we usually get

420
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,839
engaged at that point and

421
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,120
one of the number one things that the

422
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,440
insurance companies are after is how did

423
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,600
they get in what exactly happened so we

424
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,560
can you know make a determination on

425
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,040
whose fault it was or you know

426
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,000
what to do with the uh with the claim so

427
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,120
if you've got logs it's easier for the

428
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,360
responders to find out uh

429
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,240
how

430
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,480
the initial infection came about how did

431
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,639
they get in and what did they do while

432
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,160
they were there the other really

433
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,800
important thing that comes out of these

434
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,680
logs is to find out if there was any

435
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,680
ledger movement if they actually moved

436
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,959
across

437
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,279
your network to different systems and if

438
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,199
they're still there or you know

439
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,279
lots can be done once you have these

440
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,480
logs

441
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,040
we do get logs sometimes encrypted which

442
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,880
again are no help at all

443
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,040
so it's always good to have a

444
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,639
backup system for your logs as well if

445
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,120
possible

446
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,600
active monitoring is very important uh

447
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
if if you have some sort of an endpoint

448
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,160
detection response capability

449
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,680
that helps a lot um or where you know it

450
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,920
basically comes down to logs and uh what

451
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,399
happened and what was executed and when

452
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,320
that helps us build a picture together

453
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,720
that then can be presented

454
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,920
to

455
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,240
well anyone really whoever is after more

456
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,680
information about the

457
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,720
incident

458
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,519
and threat hunting capabilities if you

459
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,000
have some would go a long way as well

460
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,040
because

461
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,560
it's very important to find out if the

462
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,880
actors are still in there

463
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,560
after the actual incident

464
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,000
and

465
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,160
engage your incident response team as

466
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,480
soon as possible whoever that is

467
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,040
internal external um the earlier they

468
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,199
can get in the better they can guide you

469
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,279
through the whole process and also i

470
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,560
think the most important thing is they

471
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,959
can tell you what to protect for them to

472
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,640
be able to

473
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,520
conduct forensics and respond later on

474
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,679
cyber insurance policies

475
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,559
so quick note on that we've seen

476
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,720
a lot of the work we do involves

477
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,839
insurance most of our clients

478
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,880
do need insurance claims and

479
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,839
some help or whatever

480
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,079
in australia at least i can talk about

481
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,799
in what's happening in australia the the

482
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,640
cost of cyber insurance policies has

483
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,200
skyrocketed quite quite a bit

484
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,880
i'm pretty sure it's the same all around

485
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,160
the world

486
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,640
i was looking at some numbers and it was

487
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,200
i think in the u.s in 2018 alone they

488
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,160
were

489
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,320
around 400 million dollars worth of

490
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,280
claim um based on cyber insurance

491
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,120
policies so

492
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,760
it's very very important to make sure

493
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,000
you've got the right policy and the

494
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,880
right coverage for you know whatever

495
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,440
your needs are

496
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,600
insurance is often the first port of

497
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,039
call um

498
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,120
the reason for that being a lot of

499
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,120
insurance policies would actually cover

500
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,760
some sort of incident response for you

501
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,600
if you've picked

502
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,399
picked it that way

503
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,919
they do help with facilitation of

504
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,320
legal requirements and you know

505
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,640
incident response and all of that stuff

506
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,240
some legal sorry some insurance

507
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,400
companies also help you with ransomware

508
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,160
negotiations

509
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,120
unfortunate ids but sometimes it's

510
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,679
just you know not possible for people to

511
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,880
go okay we don't need anything

512
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,000
undecrypted so you

513
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,039
yeah you

514
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,480
end up negotiating with these guys

515
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,400
yeah it's just unfortunate but sometimes

516
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,880
you have to so yeah some some insurance

517
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,880
policies insurance companies do help you

518
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,280
with that as well they have specialists

519
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,840
who deal with these guys and who have a

520
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,080
lot of experience negotiating with

521
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,240
ransomware threat actors and gangs

522
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,080
and that's just something i mentioned

523
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,039
earlier on the cost is really going

524
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,720
crazy at the moment and i don't think

525
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,960
it's going to calm down anytime soon so

526
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,799
it's very important you

527
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,760
pick the right policies

528
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,760
communication strategies

529
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,080
i i would have to say this is probably

530
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,840
the most important aspect of incident

531
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,120
response

532
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,120
while dealing with ransomware attacks

533
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,280
just because of the scale of disruption

534
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,080
and

535
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,120
damage is just so great

536
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,280
it's

537
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,640
the biggest problem that people face the

538
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,320
organizations face when they go through

539
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,000
a ransomware attack is

540
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,600
the brand damage and

541
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,120
you know

542
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,360
it's really really important that

543
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,240
communication goes out at the right time

544
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,480
to the right people

545
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,039
coming from the right people

546
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,120
to contain all that damage all that

547
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,120
potential damage that could happen to

548
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,280
your brand

549
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,280
there's a lot of stakeholders obviously

550
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,720
in any

551
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,640
sort of incident but ransomware

552
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,159
definitely because

553
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,919
your customers

554
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,760
and internal customers external

555
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,080
customers everyone really

556
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
are affected by it they're not able to

557
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,480
access data and you know a lot of times

558
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,960
work just stops and people get pretty

559
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,159
pretty

560
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,640
anxious and

561
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,559
unsettled so it's very very important

562
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,400
that all the stakeholders are recognized

563
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,919
and then communicated with

564
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,440
there's a lot of regulatory

565
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,919
notifications and inquiries all

566
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,480
countries have their different rules and

567
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,559
legal obligations

568
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,960
so that needs to be taken care of

569
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,360
media is very important because once

570
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,120
people start talking about it in social

571
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,679
media or media it gets start starts

572
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,640
getting reported it can go out of

573
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,880
control pretty fast so it's much much

574
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,080
better that

575
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,280
you guys can

576
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,520
control that narrative as much as

577
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,400
possible yourself rather than let it

578
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
let everyone just to jump in

579
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,159
customers obviously are really really

580
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,960
important to

581
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,640
to be kept in the loop what's happening

582
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,440
and

583
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,360
where you are with the incident and the

584
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,720
response

585
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,559
internal stuff is really important as

586
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,520
well because it's very important nothing

587
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,480
goes out from within the company within

588
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,520
the organization that's not approved

589
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,240
that's not correct definitely

590
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,400
um

591
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,320
highly advisable to have a single point

592
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,080
of contact um

593
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,679
that could be just

594
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,600
one person or that could be the team

595
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,679
that takes care of communications in the

596
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,679
organization

597
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,080
everything should be routed through them

598
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,880
outwards and inwards as well

599
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,400
just so that there's no confusion and

600
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,600
there's no

601
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,600
it's all you know streamlined

602
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,919
it helps a lot if

603
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,520
just looking at a couple of security

604
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,760
incidents in the past few months

605
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,919
without going into details

606
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,919
it helps a lot if the information coming

607
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,640
out is consistent and regular

608
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,400
customers and other people in the

609
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,559
industry are not just left to wonder

610
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,760
what's happening

611
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,320
with this incident

612
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,919
and there have been a couple of

613
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,640
incidents in the past few months where

614
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,039
it wasn't handled in the best possible

615
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,320
manner and it

616
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,679
caused a lot of problems for those

617
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,320
organizations

618
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,240
need to know basis game is very

619
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,360
important

620
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,840
just to keep it all contained and

621
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,280
controlled

622
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,360
obviously people who don't need to know

623
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,960
exactly what was

624
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,039
happening or how they got in or what

625
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,640
exactly they did or what exactly they

626
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,360
could potentially do moving forward

627
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,320
shouldn't

628
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,639
be engaged regarding that information

629
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,960
very very important to have everything

630
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,679
that goes out approved by illegal and

631
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,679
the pr team because

632
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,120
you don't want to get into you know

633
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,840
legal trouble

634
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,080
and that was it i've included some

635
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,280
further reading and resources

636
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,600
have a look at them and

637
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,159
see if you can get something out of that

638
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,240
i'll open up the question and answer if

639
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,679
there are any questions and answers

640
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,710
thank you

641
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,559
[Applause]

642
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,840
thank you vishal one question yeah hello

643
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,240
uh one question about run somewhere on

644
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,080
linux servers please

645
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,240
you show some you showed some examples

646
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,159
from windows

647
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,559
so what about linux

648
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,320
uh can you take your mask off for one

649
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,960
second yeah sorry i said what about

650
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
linux servers

651
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,880
what about linux servers is the question

652
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,520
for the one somewhere yes um so a couple

653
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,120
of examples in there actually were from

654
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,200
linux

655
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,960
well it would take too long to go back

656
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,240
there but

657
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,880
yes we have seen a lot of ransomware

658
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,600
gangs targeting linux servers now

659
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,679
the reason for that is pretty obvious i

660
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,600
think 70 to 80 percent of critical

661
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,799
infrastructure

662
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,240
for most bigger organization resides on

663
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,960
linux servers

664
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,760
i have seen at least all most of the

665
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,640
major

666
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,320
ransomware thread actors pivot into

667
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,600
linux now

668
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,559
there's

669
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,400
reveal which came out with the linux

670
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,159
version called revix

671
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,840
conti came out with the

672
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,520
their linux version pretty recently

673
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,600
and

674
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,679
if you have a look back and that's back

675
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,279
on that slide

676
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,880
there's at least i think a couple of

677
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,320
examples that are based on linux servers

678
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,000
and we've definitely seen them targeting

679
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,080
mostly

680
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,880
infrastructure that's residing on vmware

681
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,400
um esx servers because that way they can

682
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,600
get basically everything right so they

683
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,320
revix was targeting esx in a way where

684
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,840
they could go in

685
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,640
access the vms running on the esx

686
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,400
servers and then start encrypting the

687
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,720
data on that conti came out not too long

688
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,960
ago just a couple of just maybe a month

689
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,919
ago

690
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,600
or maybe a couple of months ago where

691
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,559
they

692
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,039
were targeting again the esx owers

693
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,600
getting the vm lists out of it and then

694
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,279
killing all the processes so that they

695
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,400
could start

696
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,320
like it was pretty foolproof once they

697
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,520
got there and they could basically just

698
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,799
encrypt everything

699
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,640
but those

700
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,559
commands that were on those slides are

701
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,039
specific to linux systems uh if you want

702
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,320
to build detections based on that you

703
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,360
can do that

704
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,120
but you write this i answered your

705
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,279
question or did i think sorry sorry

706
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,880
thank you thanks thank you

707
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,400
another question

708
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,120
uh yeah um do you have a sense of the

709
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,960
percentage of orgs that pay the ransom

710
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,799
i'm sorry i didn't get it do you have a

711
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,880
sense of the percentage of organizations

712
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,880
that pay the ransom

713
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,400
it's really hard it's really hard

714
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,840
there's a few reasons why it's really

715
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,919
hard but one of the main reasons is not

716
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,320
everyone wants to say hey i paid

717
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,240
that's where it gets really complicated

718
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,240
we do have a lot of stats floating

719
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,400
around the internet by companies that do

720
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,640
research and i believe they're pretty

721
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,200
pretty accurate based on

722
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,720
whatever they're seeing

723
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,760
but personally i just don't think it's

724
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,919
it's possible to answer that

725
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,200
because

726
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,159
the

727
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,120
look at it this way the number of

728
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,640
companies

729
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,200
that are not divulging that paid could

730
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,559
be eighty percent

731
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,559
or could be five percent

732
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,360
but

733
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,679
we just don't know it's impossible to

734
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,760
know unless you're on the other side and

735
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,679
you're actually just counting the money

736
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,240
coming in it's it's pretty but yeah from

737
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,640
what we know it's pretty high um it's

738
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,679
higher than

739
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,600
what you would like it to be not because

740
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,200
you don't want people to pay and get

741
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,520
their files back but just because you

742
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,120
can see that these guys are getting away

743
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,520
with it that slide what that i had was

744
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,480
uh

745
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,400
it's running into millions i think the

746
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,039
top um ransomware family in there had

747
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,120
around 12 million dollars a year

748
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,279
so it must be pretty high

749
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,039
but sorry i can't really answer that

750
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,640
question it's hard

751
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,880
cheers thanks

752
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,840
what i can add however is that in many

753
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,720
countries you may have some regulations

754
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,679
or lows that will prohibit from paying

755
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,200
the ransom

756
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,039
and that may have an impact on that

757
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,039
however i fully agree with you there's

758
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,480
no way to really know what is the

759
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,039
percentage because nobody will boast

760
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,960
i've been paying the ransom

761
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,279
and maybe by

762
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,039
tracking the

763
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,240
the bitcoins or monero

764
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,440
payments you can track that but it's

765
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,240
well

766
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,480
it's a bit like it's a bit like that

767
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,320
case a few years back completely

768
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,799
non-cyber security sorry the bernie

769
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,720
madoff case right people like that was

770
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,840
60 billion but there were just so many

771
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,080
people that were affected by it who

772
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,240
never reported it because it was a big

773
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,480
big brand damage thing for them so we'll

774
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,799
never find out how much that scam was

775
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,320
right it's just a bit similar if that

776
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,240
makes any sense

777
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,440
third question

778
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,320
hi thanks for your presentation one

779
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,240
question because i think this is maybe a

780
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,600
situation where

781
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,279
often in

782
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,320
when a company is breached

783
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,200
and is attacked many of its clients will

784
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,080
cut off any connections and will often

785
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,720
ask for guarantees from the incident

786
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,000
response before it can reopen those uh

787
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,279
those connections what is your typical

788
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,760
answer to that situation

789
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,360
that's a really really good question

790
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,840
thanks for that um and and the answer i

791
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,559
have is a bit bit ambiguous to that

792
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,120
because it really depends on the way the

793
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,200
organization is set up

794
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
there's no one answer fits all for this

795
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,760
unfortunately uh it also depends there's

796
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,080
just so many factors depends which so

797
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,240
which threat actor was it and how did

798
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,399
they operate for example we looked at

799
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,279
that

800
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,679
case that i talked about briefly the

801
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,520
threat actors had been there for more

802
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,840
than two years already so

803
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,440
it really doesn't matter what they what

804
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,760
you do at that point right they had been

805
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,600
coming in and out they had megasync

806
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,000
installed and had basically just

807
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,679
taken a whole bunch of data out of it

808
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,880
so it's really easy case by case but

809
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,640
that a few years back i remember the

810
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,799
whole thing was about hey do not pull

811
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,120
the plug right don't cut it off we need

812
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,919
to track these guys

813
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,320
depends if we're tracking a nation state

814
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,360
actor

815
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,039
yes maybe but if it's just a hit and run

816
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,600
grab all ransomware what are you going

817
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,918
to do leave it open to more attacks

818
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,640
yeah the right answer to that would be

819
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,120
go in have a look

820
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,440
discuss it with the client understand

821
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,520
how they're set up and based on what you

822
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,120
find you should be able to give them

823
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,360
some sort of an answer to that in some

824
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,000
cases yeah maybe you leave it on in some

825
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,520
most cases i think it doesn't really

826
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,480
help

827
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,559
because ransomware particularly by the

828
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,360
time incident response gets involved

829
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,679
there really isn't much left to do other

830
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,440
than find out the root cause and you

831
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,520
know find out how they got in

832
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,279
report it all back so that people can

833
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,320
use it for future

834
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,399
thanks

835
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,200
any other question from the audience

836
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,240
none

837
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,559
yeah

838
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,559
hello thank you i have a small question

839
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,520
related to a normal ransom project so do

840
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,240
you have any information

841
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,799
how successful is it how how

842
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,120
often is we can find some

843
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,520
decryption key instead of that and is

844
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,840
there any initiative to

845
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,799
more support that project which is very

846
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,000
very good for

847
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,720
for uh fighting with ransomware thank

848
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,840
you

849
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,399
how much time do we have

850
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,840
uh look um that project is uh anything

851
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
that's tackling ransomware is good

852
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,760
that's what i would say right no more

853
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
ransomware um they've done a lot of

854
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,519
stuff they've you know released so many

855
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,600
decryption keys uh

856
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,519
the problem

857
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,880
with

858
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,399
any of this as far as i can think is it

859
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,120
it's very uh typical

860
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,240
these

861
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,080
campaigns are running on such a short

862
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,320
notice now where they're changing

863
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,519
overnight

864
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,679
so i mean i don't know if how many of

865
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,320
those keys you've actually tried they

866
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,960
work for a batch but it's just so easy

867
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,960
for the threat actors to move on from

868
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,360
there and you know redo the campaign in

869
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,080
like minutes now right

870
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,960
it's really good for all the

871
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,480
around somewhere that it actually works

872
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,960
for i like i said anything is good

873
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,279
but it's really really hard as well and

874
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,880
i can discuss it with you off i don't

875
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,880
know how much time you've got it it also

876
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,480
it's not just the description key you

877
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,799
have to build the entire decrypter and

878
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,840
all these guys or most of these guys um

879
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,600
other than you know kaspersky and all

880
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,799
these guys there's a lot of guys who are

881
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,159
doing it in their own time as well so

882
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,240
it's really hard to keep up

883
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,039
with that uh and obviously you need to

884
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,559
build the entire decrypter which is not

885
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,320
just a description key but the entire

886
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,240
algorithm as well

887
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,480
which changes overnight basically so

888
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,000
it's it's really hard it's really good

889
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,440
but there's a lot of other i mean

890
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,679
abuse.ch is one of the

891
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,440
really good malware resource overall not

892
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,200
just ransomware

893
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,919
publish so many ioc that you can use

894
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,039
every day

895
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,120
there's a lot of other research

896
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,120
that but i would definitely look for

897
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,720
anything that you can build detections

898
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,760
on because that's probably more

899
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,399
helpful without being specific to just

900
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,279
one batch of that campaign

901
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,480
just

902
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,240
learning how these guys operate what

903
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,679
commands they use

904
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,960
using that information to build

905
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,159
detection

906
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,559
that's probably the best uh i can give

907
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,960
you some resources after that after this

908
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,880
talk thank you thank you very much no

909
