let's start the

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,480
next part of this

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,160
interesting afternoon and welcome on the

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,520
stage

andres iquedi and sami

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,439
makadam both from circle in luxembourg

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,320
and

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,840
they have been working with the miss

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,400
project for a long time

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,679
and us for

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,800
almost a decade or something like that

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,320
certainly also for some years we know

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,760
them from that but they have a new

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,559
project it's the celebrate project which

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,440
i

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,680
for one am very interested to hear more

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,840
about i hope you are also let's welcome

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,079

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,839
thank you thanks a lot

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,879
so uh welcome everyone so we're indeed

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,160
here to talk to you about a new tool

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,000
that we've been working on so if you

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,680
have been to the session this morning

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,359
about melisartas you kind of got a

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,559
teaser about what we're going to be

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,840
talking about

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,760
so let's dive into it

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,000
a tiny bit about us who we are so we're

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,320
basically both from circle we are

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,439
basically the luxembourgish

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,680
search for the private sector

35
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,840
so we are funded by the ministry of

36
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,640
economy and our goal is our mandate is

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,960
basically to build security for the

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,400
community at large

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,080
now being in this weird situation that

40
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,680
we're in luxembourg a lot of companies

41
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,280
are incorporated there so our

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,600
constituency is really broadly defined

43
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,079
so we we are pretty

44
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,439
open to and the global community

45
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,119
as we have basically

46
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,720
in our constituency players from all

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,920
around the world

48
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,520
uh we are also

49
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,840
besides being assert developing quite a

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,119
few open source tools so indeed uh misp

51
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,320
is one of the ones that we've been

52
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,560
developing over the past

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,159
decade

54
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,520
but there are also some other tools that

55
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,119
we're working on

56
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,399
including what we're going to be talking

57
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,240
about now cerebrate

58
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,240
so a quick recap of the session this

59
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
morning there is basically a project

60
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,880
called melicertas funded

61
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,959
by the

62
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,560
european commission

63
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,440
um

64
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,640
basically uh the goal of this uh this

65
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,200
tooling is to build a common set of

66
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,680
tooling and uh interactions for the

67
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,480
different national seasons

68
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,319
in europe

69
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,560
and we've been

70
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,360
working on this project since 2020

71
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,280
and one of the core components of this

72
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,200
project

73
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,959
that we've developed from scratch is

74
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,519
cerebrate so it came from this project

75
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,000
but it is not meant to be only part of

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,319
this project so we ourselves have our

77
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,480
own selfish reasons we want to

78
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,319
make our own lives easier so we mostly

79
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,080
build tools that we also use ourselves

80
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,280
as a cert

81
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,040
so this basically solves several issues

82
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,440
for us as well that we'll dive into

83
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,599
basically the main

84
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,400
role that the tool takes in the military

85
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,560
landscape is contact management

86
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,640
orchestration and sharing group

87
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,839
distribution and management

88
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,720
yeah

89
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,519
so

90
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,920
these are some statistics of

91
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,000
one of our instance mistmasters that we

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,040
are running at circle so you can see on

93
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,760
the left side the amount of data that we

94
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,239
have to deal with so we have

95
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,319
millions of uh events and even more of

96
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,519
attributes

97
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,080
um so and these all of this data is

98
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,879
coming from um a lot of different users

99
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,560
belonging to other organizations and

100
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
various type of organization as you can

101
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,680
see on the right side and if we look at

102
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,959
how

103
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,920
many organizations we gain every month

104
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,480
and even over time you can see that we

105
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,760
have a steady

106
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,360
amount of a new organization uh

107
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,360
starting to use the project or being

108
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,280
connected to our instance or just

109
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
raising the platform again and again

110
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,519
so on the

111
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,519
the blue bar or the created organization

112
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,000
these are the ones that ask to have

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,560
access to our instance and on the yellow

114
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,239
one these are actually organizations

115
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,640
that don't have not have access to our

116
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,319
instance but we know from

117
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,920
synchronization nodes

118
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,720
so

119
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,599
you can see that it's becoming

120
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,519
more and more organization having that

121
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,839
we have to deal with

122
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,238
so basically uh having a lot of

123
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,240
communities is great

124
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,520
so obviously we're happy to to be part

125
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,280
of many communities and to exchange with

126
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,080
many communities it helps our

127
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,320
day-to-day work

128
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,120
but

129
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,919
but basically this also comes with its

130
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,759
own issues i mean the advantages are

131
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,759
obvious we basically

132
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,000
interconnect communities that already

133
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,400
had really strong sharing

134
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,320
practices in place

135
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,160
with other ones so that we have this

136
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,560
overlap of information so we can

137
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,560
be informed about trends that others are

138
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,520
facing

139
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,520
faster so this is one of the main

140
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,199
advantages we're seeing the reuse of

141
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,199
ttps reuse of

142
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,520
of the different uh

143
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,199
tools

144
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,199
by attackers in these different

145
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,520
communities we also see hybrid threats

146
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,919
being cross-correlated so very often if

147
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,600
you're coming from a financial fraud

148
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,280
background for example you're going to

149
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,960
see an overlap for example with a lot of

150
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,199
the ransomware ceo fraud and so on cases

151
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,880
that we're dealing with so sometimes the

152
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,039
correlations are not purely on technical

153
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,720
data points but really on these

154
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,400
interconnections between

155
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,680
similar things happening at the same

156
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,560
time

157
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,880
finally one of the reasons why we also

158
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,639
want to be inclusive in these

159
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,240
communities is

160
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,280
we are

161
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,960
in a really

162
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,039
beneficial position we are

163
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,360
all from i.t backgrounds so we obviously

164
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,280
can build our own tools more easily than

165
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,199
other sectors since we are all i.t

166
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,479
professionals

167
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,080
so we want to just spread love also to

168
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,919
other communities and to get to get more

169
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,919
involvement also from other sectors out

170
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,680
there

171
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,840
so with this in mind

172
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,000
with these advantages

173
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,160
it also means that a more diverse and

174
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,840
larger community can also create more

175
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,319
types of issues to solve

176
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,240
i mean the biggest one being social

177
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,400
interactions and lack of trust this is

178
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,600
why

179
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,759
why communities like first are so great

180
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,919
because you get to meet and interact

181
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,479
with people and solve the biggest hurdle

182
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,160
in information sharing all together

183
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,560
which is really a trust aspect

184
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,319
you gain a lot of points of contact and

185
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,080
very often the sharing still relies on

186
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,680
personal trust rather than just

187
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,680
organizational

188
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,120
rules

189
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,720
there are also some technical issues

190
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,080
that we have to overcome

191
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,840
uh for example one of the ones that

192
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,240
we've learned with mr it was becoming

193
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,880
tricky was identity management samia's

194
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,199
already mentioned a large

195
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,440
growing set of organizations

196
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,440
being able to validate

197
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,160
data as sources who those organizations

198
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,919
actually are and having a

199
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,000
community-centric approach

200
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,680
of managing this was something that

201
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,280
we're missing in this

202
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,680
so this is some still an unresolved

203
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,440
issue and we want to basically solve

204
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,280
this issue

205
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,800
we also

206
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,560
have to do i mean for those of you that

207
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,639
are using misp for example things like

208
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,880
organization uuid management and so on

209
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,720
are tricky over time if you're dealing

210
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,039
with larger and larger communities

211
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,560
uh so this is

212
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,000
really some of one of the hurdles that

213
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,479
we're trying to overcome

214
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,360
in addition to all of these issues

215
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,199
when you have to deal with a community

216
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,520
you want to be also able to to to know

217
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,800
the constituency of this organization so

218
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,680
in addition to having like a standard

219
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,199
data point that you can save on

220
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,039
organizations such as i don't know the

221
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,960
name of the company

222
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,639
the point of contact with the company

223
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,599
the

224
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,680
contact email address and so on we also

225
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,319
wanted to be able to to keep information

226
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,360
about as it says the constituency

227
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,599
especially looking at some

228
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,360
non-really technical

229
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,680
pointers such as the geographic location

230
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,800
so for the country the the region and so

231
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,120
on but also the sector is it the

232
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,039
financial sector the

233
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,280
telecommunications sector and so on

234
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,160
but on the technical side we also want

235
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,560
uh to be able to know for example for

236
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,039
the cider blocks if an ip address who

237
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,280
should be contact to for an abuse report

238
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,599
for example or same for an ice number so

239
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,440
we wanted to take these different type

240
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,520
of data points

241
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,199
that are of different type of course we

242
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,199
have some free text we also have some ip

243
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,039
addresses that we want to enforce as a

244
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,759
format and you want them to save this

245
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,520
in addition to that

246
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,919
we have also the cryptography

247
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,799
cryptographic key lookup for information

248
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,399
signing

249
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,519
and

250
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,599
if you share information

251
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,799
sometimes

252
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,399
you want to make sure that this

253
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,399
information is coming from the the

254
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,000
correct sender

255
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,240
and so in mist we have implemented the

256
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,000
mechanism that is called the protected

257
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,680
event feature

258
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,160
that is fairly new not a few versions

259
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,839
ago

260
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,760
and yeah so it's just a small teaser so

261
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,120
if you want to learn more about this

262
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,320
feature

263
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,080
just feel free to come to the miss

264
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,200
workshop that we have on thursday

265
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,560
so in addition to this geographic

266
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,880
sectoral and technical data such as ip

267
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,360
addresses and nice number and so on

268
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,160
we also wanted to to make sure every

269
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,000
type of community because of the the

270
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
sheer amount of

271
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,360
the different type of community that we

272
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,560
have

273
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,440
is able to save their own

274
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,200
model

275
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,000
so by that

276
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,839
well what you will you will also see

277
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,560
that later on in this presentation

278
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,920
but

279
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,320
based on specific templating system that

280
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
you may have in your organization you

281
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,360
will be able to save all of this

282
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,519
information in cerebrate so that you

283
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,760
don't have to conform to our format and

284
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,880
how we designed the the application

285
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
sharing group management and i already

286
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,240
mentioned the issue this is really

287
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,839
something that we want to tackle and

288
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,920
make it as easy as possible for anyone

289
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,959
to to create distribution list and also

290
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,519
obviously to share them

291
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,279
and synchronization we at circle we love

292
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,800
synchronization we love information

293
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,760
sharing

294
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,000
so of course we also wanted to to make

295
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,399
sure that it is as easy as possible for

296
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,720
everyone to create information and then

297
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,120
share it with partners

298
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,880
and look at system is a bit similar to

299
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,320
synchronization but yeah

300
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,320
so

301
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,079
a little bit about what we try to do in

302
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,760
the answer so what our solution to these

303
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,000
issues are so we we started this uh

304
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,240
working on server about two years ago

305
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,399
it is now deployed in uh in several

306
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,160
places including for the season network

307
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,519
which is currently in pilot phase

308
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,720
the uh

309
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,200
the idea was that basically it's a rich

310
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,800
contact database so it contains

311
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,720
information about organizations about

312
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,800
individuals

313
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,880
and all the metadata that uh summing

314
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,399
into that

315
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,800
as well as being tightly coupled to to

316
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,959
other tools that we use so we have an

317
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,160
integration layer that we're going to

318
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,279
talk about that allows us to

319
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,200
interconnect cerebrate with other tools

320
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,519
such as mist but also other ones it's

321
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,160
easy to define your own so we'll look at

322
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,680
that in a moment

323
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,440
but the idea is that

324
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,120
that you can build your own integrations

325
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,880
rather easily

326
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,160
so it besides that obviously

327
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,760
us wearing two hats with misspent

328
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,000
cerebral at the same time we wanted to

329
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,720
make use of this tool for misp itself so

330
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,480
it is becoming the de facto fleet

331
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,880
management tool for misps

332
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,160
if you're if you're

333
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,000
a power user of mist you probably end up

334
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,760
in a situation very often where you are

335
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,920
running multiple missed instances and

336
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,600
managing multiple for different

337
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,079
communities different use cases can be a

338
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:42,959
hassle

339
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,480
so that means you have to log into each

340
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,160
of those admin interfaces you need to

341
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,480
modify all those settings add users and

342
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,480
so on so all these basic things become a

343
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,320
hassle the more instances you have we

344
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,639
want to centralize this uh with cerberus

345
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,480
and every single tool that manages this

346
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,079
yeah even though we had missed in mind

347
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,760
we really wanted to have a modular

348
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,600
system as you will see later on so that

349
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,079
any other tool that you have you you

350
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,519
will be able to also integrate it with

351
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,920
cerebrite and and also perform fleet

352
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,399
management yeah exactly so so

353
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,320
it's our first target for it but we also

354
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,480
have ideas about our are other tools

355
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,920
that we want to integrate ourselves to

356
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,040
make our lives easier so indeed

357
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,320
and the idea is that everyone should be

358
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,160
able to do that as for the technology

359
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,519
used behind it

360
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,079
it is very similar to miss with the

361
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,920
differentiation that it's using a much

362
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,959
more modern version of the stack

363
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,160
that is

364
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,920
obviously kind of dual purpose so first

365
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,440
of all we wanted to move to something

366
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,600
more modern the other thing is we wanted

367
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,440
to be able to transition miss slowly to

368
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,920
the modern stack as well so we use this

369
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,000
also as a vehicle we're converging the

370
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,760
developments of the two tools they're

371
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,320
already sharing a lot of the code base

372
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,800
which makes it easier for us to uh to

373
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,959
align the two tools and finally also to

374
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,320
move miss over to the same design

375
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,639
one of the approaches also that we had

376
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,480
during the entire development

377
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,680
was to

378
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,880
to

379
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,920
build cerebrate to be a central node for

380
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,240
a community also for the iam part so

381
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,160
that means for the identity management

382
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,839
part so it is tightly integrated

383
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,160
or built to be integrated with

384
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,839
with iem systems we've already

385
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,440
integrated with key cloak we're also

386
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,560
planning to

387
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,800
open this up to other ones in the future

388
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,639
the idea is that cerebrate can be the

389
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,000
authoritative

390
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,240
interface to manage key cloak the good

391
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,480
thing with that is that you can assign

392
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,040
roles for community members to manage

393
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,760
their own teams directly through

394
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,360
cerberet without giving them access to

395
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,120
the iem directly

396
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,519
so it already filters what they can do

397
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,360
and makes it a lot more easy and

398
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,639
convenient for us for community

399
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,399
some other core functionalities but we

400
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,240
will not go into much detail friends so

401
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,320
if you refuse before you'll see that we

402
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,399
have a very api centric

403
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,720
approach to building our tools it's the

404
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,000
same here so if you want to build

405
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,920
automation with cerebrate it's just as

406
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,920
simple as with misp everything you can

407
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,560
do in the interface is api exposed it's

408
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,800
all documented by open api so it should

409
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,719
be rather easy to get started with it

410
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,440
and that brings us exactly to this point

411
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,399
uh

412
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,639
celebrate was built around well having

413
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,399
api in mind so what you're currently

414
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,639
seeing as a screenshot is actually an

415
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,480
integration of celebrate in misp

416
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,839
obviously that's the first integration

417
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,680
with it because with the we are

418
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,440
developing both the

419
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,680
these two tools

420
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,279
so if you're not really familiar with

421
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,000
this interface which is also quite new

422
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,040
compared to the whole lifespan of misp

423
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,519
what you're looking at is mis

424
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,040
queried

425
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,720
a celebrate node

426
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,800
and get and got the list of organization

427
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,399
that is that are stored on that

428
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,360
cerebrate instance and so you can see

429
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,600
i hope at least with the color on the

430
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,480
left side the status saying that mist

431
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,199
knows about a specific organization

432
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,040
or that the organization on the

433
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,199
celebrate instance uh is more

434
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,680
complicated as the latest data

435
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,760
uh and the last one the the check mark

436
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,839
basically means that the two data are

437
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,000
aligned for this organization and from

438
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,760
misp so you're able to query a separate

439
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,440
instance and obviously you are also able

440
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,600
to save this information data into your

441
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,360
mispence stance so this is for

442
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,440
organization but also for sharing groups

443
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,199
yeah so

444
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,240
um so how does celebrate fit in all of

445
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,399
these various local tools

446
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,160
so i will start with the the top of the

447
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,279
diagram

448
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,120
where you have a cerebrate node which

449
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,440
has information about a contact database

450
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,560
such as individuals organizations

451
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,639
sharing groups distribution lists extra

452
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,199
circles

453
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,399
and then we have

454
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,240
at the bottom this orchestration

455
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,839
interface

456
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,880
which

457
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,240
can interact and

458
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,079
well interact with different local tools

459
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,399
and the symbols on the icons on the

460
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,079
bottom are what we call local tools so

461
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,240
basically tools that you run

462
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,079
associate cert that helps you do your

463
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,720
daily tasks so for example miss intel mq

464
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,279
articulating systems such as d-hive or

465
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,920
rtr from this practical

466
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,440
and really the idea is that you have

467
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,519
celebrate that provides information

468
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,759
about all of this contact information

469
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,920
and but also can play a bit with us with

470
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,240
these tools as you will see in a few

471
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,399
slides

472
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,600
yep uh so here is a small example of

473
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,040
what the contact database looks like so

474
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,560
if you're familiar with misp you will

475
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,480
find that the layout is very similar so

476
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,320
we were kind of trying to have the same

477
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,600
look and feel even though it's a more

478
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,279
modern coating

479
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,000
but basically the idea is that uh that

480
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,199
when what someone mentioned with the

481
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,360
custom data formats what you see here on

482
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,120
top you see the basic fields that are

483
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,079
coming

484
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,240
from cerebrate itself so those are the

485
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,680
data points that we identified are

486
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,240
crucial for describing an organization

487
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,680
and everything below is coming from

488
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,399
specific libraries

489
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,800
or custom libraries that align with what

490
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,559
certain communities use so here you see

491
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,240
for example we have a lisa c cert

492
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,839
network

493
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,559
mapping we also mapping for uh first

494
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,359
data set or for organizations also for

495
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,640
uh

496
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
i think tfc search we have one as well

497
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,480
if you're not

498
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,039
so yeah basically we're trying to uh to

499
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,640
build out these different data models

500
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,240
where to capture all the different data

501
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,319
points that these repositories of

502
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,400
information have already the idea is

503
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,919
that if you have if you have a national

504
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,080
level uh

505
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,679
contact database that you want to move

506
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,840
to cerebrate you should be able to map

507
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,000
it by creating your own mapping for it

508
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,440
and your own data points and the

509
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,880
interesting thing is that a lot of those

510
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,400
data points are

511
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,640
type aware so that means that what what

512
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,160
sami has already mentioned for example

513
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,480
with sidereel lookups you can create in

514
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,960
the in the template cider fields or

515
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,360
other types of meta fields that will

516
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,200
then have special search algorithms

517
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,400
attached to it when you're doing

518
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,320
searches against your data set

519
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,840
so that should make your life quite a

520
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,360
bit easier

521
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,840
so this is basically what

522
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,520
an organization index looks like in the

523
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,919
end so it's rather straightforward if

524
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,240
you know how miss works you're familiar

525
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,320
with it one big change here is you can

526
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,960
customize also what you display

527
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,799
on each of the indexes so for example

528
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,720
one of the things that for first members

529
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,160
in the first community would be

530
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,799
interesting would be to show the status

531
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,120
within first for each of the teams

532
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,480
so that would be one of the fields that

533
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,919
you would probably want to have on your

534
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,679
index in your community but with the

535
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,280
same data shared with another community

536
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,559
they might be interested in different

537
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,080
data points

538
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,320
so this is all configurable per user and

539
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,280
program

540
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,600
for instance

541
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,480
so that's exactly what andras has

542
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,760
explained

543
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,559
but

544
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,400
not to go into the details

545
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,360
you basically have the abilities to save

546
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,039
your custom

547
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,960
information into what we call meta

548
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
templates which can be defined for the

549
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,600
different type of uh

550
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,320
well

551
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,320
uh entities like uh ontario's mission

552
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,919
the first directory in his ancestor

553
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,120
directory

554
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,360
and for ip side of blocks ice numbers

555
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,440
the one that we call uh sister

556
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,559
constituency and uh this is a screenshot

557
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,640
of the first directory that what it

558
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,720
would look like uh in celebrate

559
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,120
yeah this is the index of the meta

560
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,480
template where you can see the details

561
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,520
of what you can use what type of field

562
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,600
you can use using a specific meta

563
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,960
template so in this case the first one

564
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,080
and just to to show that this system is

565
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,919
really flexible the way you can create

566
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,080
meta template is fairly easy you just

567
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,280
describe it

568
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,520
as a json file and then save it in to a

569
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,840
directory uh the installation directory

570
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,600
of the arbit basically and then you just

571
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,440
load it by clicking one button and

572
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,360
celebrate is aware of it and you can use

573
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,840
it right away

574
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,000
so a little bit about the sharing group

575
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,080
management so one of the things that we

576
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,400
really struggled with especially if

577
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,000
you're part of any of those larger

578
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,640
communities that have a lot of

579
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,400
sensitive sharing going on where you

580
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,919
really want to define who you're sharing

581
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,280
information with

582
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,720
one of the tricky things is you create a

583
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,640
sharing group and you still need to

584
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,640
inform the other parties of that sharing

585
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,159
group so that they can reuse it and

586
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,400
start sharing back information with you

587
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,960
in miss the way this works is that that

588
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,880
this entire process is coupled with the

589
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,720
data sharing itself so i need to share

590
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,240
data in a sharing group for the sharing

591
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
group to propagate this was a hurdle

592
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,600
because we ended up with with

593
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,280
duplications of efforts people were

594
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,880
creating the same sharing group the same

595
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,520
concept as different sharing group

596
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,440
entities on their own instances and then

597
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,600
sharing data back and forth which led to

598
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,960
a mess

599
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,120
also

600
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,559
one of the things we wanted to do is we

601
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,720
wanted to have an authoritative figure

602
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,240
manage the sharing groups for

603
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,840
communities to use

604
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,080
for example we're part or we're

605
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,440
operating

606
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,480
communities for gsma

607
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,880
m operators where basically the idea is

608
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,679
also that and they want to be able to

609
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,520
create certain sharing groups based on

610
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,200
their membership levels this is

611
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,880
something that is created by the central

612
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,720
authority of the community but they have

613
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,559
no way of propagating the sharing groups

614
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,679
out so that everyone reuses those so

615
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,200
this is a one of the issues that we

616
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,280
wanted to move to cerebral basically and

617
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,200
this is what it basically looks like in

618
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
practice so it's if you know how it

619
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,799
works in misp it's basically the same

620
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,559
idea

621
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,919
um

622
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,919
yeah yeah sure but this one was already

623
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,440
kind of presented

624
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,280
in a way that you are able to store

625
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,480
information about the organization

626
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,840
sharing group

627
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,200
but at that point it would also make

628
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,640
sense to store information about

629
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,720
cryptographic key so that you are also

630
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,720
able to use the system to make

631
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,600
data signing and validation uh and

632
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,120
that's also

633
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,600
kind of a teaser for the mispredicted

634
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,280
event yeah one of the tricky things here

635
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,720
is we're not just talking about personal

636
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,799
signing it's also system signing keys

637
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,440
and the the lookup of those is generally

638
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,200
quite tricky because they're not tied to

639
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,960
the same email address of contact that

640
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,159
you know and so on so uh managing these

641
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,400
is is trickier unless you have a like a

642
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,799
central note for uh for the for the

643
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,640
community this is basically what it

644
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,600
looks like in cerebrate

645
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,520
yeah

646
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,120
so

647
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,320
you have access to all of this

648
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,240
information

649
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,440
but sometimes well right now in ceret we

650
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,960
have authentication to access this

651
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,360
information but sometimes you want this

652
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,039
information to be available to everyone

653
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,440
because well for example the first one

654
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,440
it's public so it would make sense to

655
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,799
having this information public in

656
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,000
celebrate too

657
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,240
so we created a system where you can

658
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,360
also specify them specific indexes such

659
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,440
as the organization index

660
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,280
would be public and that would allow

661
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,080
other tools such as this for example or

662
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,840
any or even another celebrate node

663
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,480
actually to connect to this public index

664
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
or open directory and fetch this

665
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,640
information or even visualize it

666
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,799
with the user interface

667
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,960
so the idea is really to also create

668
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,360
trusted nodes for public use as well so

669
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,520
we as circle will run our own node that

670
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,919
will be a publicly trusted node where if

671
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,919
anyone wants to validate an organization

672
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,080
they're signing keys and so on they can

673
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,159
do it on our repository so if we contain

674
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,760
their data then they can do a lookup

675
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,679
against our instance and we encourage

676
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,320
communities to run this for

677
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,840
as open directories in general

678
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,960
so for the sharing aspect itself

679
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,120
it works very similarly to misp so we

680
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,440
can interconnect with other server nodes

681
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,280
and we can exchange information with

682
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,440
them so that means that we can

683
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,039
preview data we can diagnose

684
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,440
connectivity issues and so on and we can

685
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,279
remotely browse and cherry pick data

686
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,120
that we're interested in or just bulk

687
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,960
import the data that they have

688
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,679
um so left screenshot for that

689
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,520
so it's it's very

690
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,840
forward again if you've ever used this

691
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,320
before it should be something that you

692
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,799
recognize immediately

693
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:57,840
okay

694
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,679
so um

695
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,360
for a synchronization part something

696
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,960
else that is slightly different than

697
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,760
miss

698
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,080
is that we we want to build it with so

699
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,760
this is not yet done but this is coming

700
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,400
in upcoming version we want to have two

701
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,360
ways of of trusting another community so

702
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
there are trust standard

703
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,279
synchronization connections and trusted

704
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,600
connections trusted connections can be

705
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,760
used to update data that you already

706
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,559
have

707
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,640
while standard connections only feed you

708
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,200
new data the idea behind that is that if

709
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,880
you have an authoritative source in a

710
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,960
community such as a first instance would

711
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,400
be for example

712
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,240
then all the the members of the

713
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
community would inherently trust the

714
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,320
data coming from first for for the

715
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
contact database they could receive

716
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,240
other data from their constituents but

717
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,240
it would never update or change anything

718
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,200
that is

719
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,279
coming from the first uh database

720
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,440
okay

721
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,159
you want to yeah i can do it but the

722
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,760
thing is we are kind of running out of

723
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,919
okay okay so maybe we can just escape

724
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,120
because it's kind of introducing

725
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,720
the next one

726
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
where basically what we want to say in

727
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
these two slides it's basically we

728
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,200
design a system to integra so we've

729
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,559
mentioned a lot of time integration with

730
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,559
smith because obviously that's

731
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,240
what we really wanted to have in

732
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,440
cerebrate us at the first place um

733
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,159
but

734
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,440
all this integration with so-called

735
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
tools we made it so that it's easy for

736
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,960
everyone to also integrate their own

737
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,720
tools so

738
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,640
you you can also similar to the meta

739
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,440
template system drop files but that that

740
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,960
that time it would not be json but it

741
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,039
would be php file because the celebrate

742
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,520
is written in php but it it's fairly

743
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,640
easy

744
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,039
to use helper function that we design

745
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,679
to interconnect create interface inside

746
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,760
celebrate for your local tool and also

747
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,360
manipulate your local tools using

748
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,360
celebrate as you will see an example for

749
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,720
miss

750
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,279
so in that case this is some example of

751
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,080
what

752
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,760
cerebrate can already do using the mist

753
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,600
connector in cerebrate where you can

754
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,760
configure miss pinstance you can also

755
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,880
fetch sharing group an organization

756
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,279
diagnose your mispence using just the

757
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,640
connection test

758
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,360
and also manage user

759
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,880
this is what it looks like in in

760
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,080
cerebrate where we are actually here um

761
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,279
viewing uh the igloo tu misp instance

762
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,200
and browsing the organization that it

763
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,720
has and you can see on the right side

764
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,480
that you can also download this organic

765
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,880
organization

766
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,720
okay

767
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,600
so we have this capability to manipulate

768
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,120
one missed instance uh or one local tool

769
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,000
so why stop there so

770
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,400
why not just continue and made it so

771
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,760
that we can manipulate multiple at the

772
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,279
same time and that's why we we did this

773
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,679
fleet management system for local tools

774
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,440
as it's already implemented in this

775
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,559
because that's the only tool that

776
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,240
support it right now

777
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,320
but you can see on the next

778
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,640
slides that um

779
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,480
you have the mist connector and on the

780
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,919
right side you have the connections that

781
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,840
are instantiated using this connector

782
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,120
and for that one you can see that you

783
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,600
can manipulate already three mistances

784
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,360
at the same time

785
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,600
yeah so basically what sami has

786
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,960
mentioned with this one of our goals

787
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,400
with the system to

788
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,799
is the community management part so that

789
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,000
means that you can basically choose

790
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,360
which of the local tools you want to

791
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,039
expose to community for example i have a

792
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,200
miss running i have an uh

793
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,880
private ticketing system something else

794
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,159
running that i want to share with the

795
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,840
community and say you can ask for

796
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840
connection requests to this tool

797
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,360
i make it available to you so you don't

798
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,880
have to share all your missed instances

799
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,720
all your other tools but the ones that

800
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,559
you want to expose are then visible to

801
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,320
the community and then the community

802
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,320
members can can ask for interconnection

803
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,240
requests to these individual tools and

804
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,000
open

805
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
interconnection requests

806
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,240
so these interconnection requests then

807
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,240
follow a three-way handshake so that

808
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,760
means that the tool itself will

809
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,840
basically

810
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,600
go through this process of

811
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,200
of sending a request to the other

812
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,279
cerbert node

813
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,960
my dear could you promise

814
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,559
provide me with access to your miss

815
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,600
pinsons

816
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,039
and yeah it would be my pleasure here

817
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,480
you go the second

818
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,640
phase and finally the connection is

819
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,960
accepted and finalized on both sides and

820
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,320
then the connection is already there so

821
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,679
if you've ever set up synchronization

822
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,840
links between miss instances it can be a

823
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,000
hassle and things can go wrong and the

824
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,679
idea is to take over this task the

825
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,440
integration layer takes care of it so if

826
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
you want to have 2-2 integration with

827
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,720
your tools

828
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,640
you can take over this task and add

829
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,960
safeguards in there so that users don't

830
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,240
mess up their interconnection requests

831
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,840
this is what it looks like actually in

832
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,880
cerebrates not using a meme but

833
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,000
you can see that

834
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,080
this is a message that one server would

835
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,520
receive

836
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,720
on the receiving side so at that stage

837
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,399
a cerebrate not already sent an

838
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,559
interconnection request and

839
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,120
the second survey is currently viewing

840
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,520
the the initial request that was sent

841
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,840
and he can decide to either accept it

842
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,760
and then proceed to the interconnection

843
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,320
of his mispencence or to decline the

844
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,678
request and it will stop there

845
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,120
so uh some other things just a quick uh

846
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,279
listing of of what else cerebrate does

847
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,960
or will do in the future

848
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,559
mailing list management is also already

849
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,159
implemented so the idea is that we have

850
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,520
all this information about individuals

851
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,520
and so on we want to be able to create

852
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,120
mailing lists and push it to other tools

853
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,720
so that we can start interacting with

854
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,520
them

855
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,360
instead of having to retype everything

856
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,880
you know all those different tools that

857
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,240
we would use for it

858
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,000
it is a strong acl system that is

859
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,679
configurable

860
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,840
and again configurable to get together

861
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,360
with

862
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,200
an iem system

863
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,880
it has an inbox system that allows you

864
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,480
to send messages between the different

865
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,240
server nodes for example for

866
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,080
interconnect connection requests but

867
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,240
also for other tools

868
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,399
we are labeling making everything

869
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,480
labelable in the tool which helps with

870
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,120
filtering and searching and so on so you

871
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,360
can even for example in a community

872
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,159
label individual individuals with their

873
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,399
various skills who does have these

874
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,799
capabilities who can i contact if i have

875
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,880
questions about this tool about this

876
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,960
technique so you can include all of this

877
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,880
information directly in there

878
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
besides that

879
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,720
the rest is not that interesting this

880
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,880
one and for the missed users this is a

881
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,640
really painful thing and we hope that we

882
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,720
can get this also over to miss the whole

883
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,640
thing is themeable and customizable i

884
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,240
know it's a small thing but number of

885
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,840
requests we get for this month missed is

886
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,799
crazy

887
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,000
and currently what we have on the

888
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,640
roadmap we basically want to have

889
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,240
full-blown data signing so this is

890
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,080
something we're working on for miss

891
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,240
and the idea is also to incorporate

892
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,399
cerebrate as the key distribution

893
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,480
vehicle for this for communities

894
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,559
so right now the data signing that

895
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,919
that samia's mentioned is more in the

896
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,159
connection layer itself but we want to

897
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,320
have full-blown data signing and

898
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,320
validation coming to misp as well in the

899
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,600
near future

900
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,880
other than that we want to integrate it

901
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,120
with more tools so this is

902
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,039
the right now the framework is there the

903
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,559
system is there it works it has some

904
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,200
integrations but very few we want to go

905
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,559
way beyond that and extend it with a

906
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,919
bunch of different other tools like the

907
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,720
ones listed on there that's basically it

908
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,559
if you want to integrate server in your

909
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,360
tool

910
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,760
get in touch with us or go to github

911
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,840
if you want to have a live demo get in

912
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,399
touch again so we can help you there and

913
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,399
if you want to suggest any features if

914
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,080
you have ideas for integrations or

915
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,320
something that is missing also get in

916
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,960
touch with us that's it thank you thank

917
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,960
you

918
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,600
thank you very much for a very

919
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,640
interesting

920
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,960
question presentation of this new tool

921
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,159
i'm looking forward to using it actually

922
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,559
any questions from the audience we have

923
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,480
a microphone over there and another over

924
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,720
here feel free to come up and ask

925
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,240
questions

926
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,519
to understand sami

927
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,679
yes villus

928
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,399
i want to ask about templating um

929
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,919
does it allow to

930
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,880
assign multiple ip ranges as well maybe

931
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,240
it can be extended with urls yeah

932
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,480
yeah absolutely i mean the default

933
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,080
templates that we already have in there

934
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,279
for different ones already allow

935
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,600
multiple ap addresses ip ranges and so

936
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,480
on

937
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,960
and if you want to extend it with other

938
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,840
data points like urls we had a s numbers

939
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,360
for example as one of the ones that we

940
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,200
want in there absolutely it's really

941
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,279
easy to do so it's just editing a json

942
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,760
file thank you

943
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,519
thank you

944
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,720
yes

945
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,360
other questions

946
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,159
yeah hi um we obviously we have our own

947
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,919
contact database and you said you can

948
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,760
interact great with like the first

949
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,279
contact database and things like that

950
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,360
but what kind of form can i like and

951
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,159
take the my database and move it over to

952
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,760
cerebrate

953
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,399
okay so so what format

954
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,919
yeah like what kind of form are you

955
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,919
expecting to be able to move right our

956
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,960
own database into right i i mean uh

957
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,799
cerebrate uh there are two ways of doing

958
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,960
it so one would indeed be to just export

959
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,519
it in a format and feed it to a

960
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,679
to cerebrate the other is uh serb it

961
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,919
also has an ingestion mechanism

962
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,440
so you can write easily scripts that

963
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,519
will query other tools for data that's

964
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,799
what we did for example with the

965
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,200
first api or the

966
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,760
api and so on so generally that's the

967
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,840
way we would do it this would

968
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,480
we would map the data not to cerebrate

969
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,080
but from cerebral to the other one and

970
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,600
pull the data in

971
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,799
um so

972
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,399
we have some good examples on how to do

973
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,559
it and it's rather straightforward

974
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,480
okay so yeah and also support csv

975
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,880
yeah okay in addition to the g server

976
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,320
obviously

977
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,159
but sometimes wait it's the most common

978
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,840
use format true for information sharing

979
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,440
yeah we have room for a question or two

980
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,679
more

981
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,279
no one

982
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,120
yes we'll go back home and integrate

983
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,600
with our misp and with matamos and

984
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,600
mailman and everything that's a very

985
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,039
interesting perspective i think for

986
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,120
our toolbox at home

987
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,879
so let's all give anderson some warm

988
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,400
applause for this

989
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:17,440
[Applause]

990
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,079
thank you very much and next up on the

991
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,760
agenda is

992
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,679
coffee

993
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,679
or tea if you prefer

994
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,679
downstairs
