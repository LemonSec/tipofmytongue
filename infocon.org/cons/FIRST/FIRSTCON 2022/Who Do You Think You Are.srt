i want to introduce the session name

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,920
this who do you think you are i think

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,280
the name is taken by a tv series maybe

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,320
and

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,040
let me help to introduce to our maruk

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,760

session well thank you all for coming um

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,719
there's some fantastic sessions going on

22
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,119
at the at this very moment so hopefully

23
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,479
you're in the place that you wanted to

24
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,920
come to i know there were other ones

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,439
that i'd probably uh rather have been at

26
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,360
um

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,759
so who do you think you are i can't

28
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,200
really see the lights are really bright

29
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,640
here but just to get an idea from the

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,520
audience um do you have a program that

31
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,200
is a little bit like this where you're

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,119
from so hands up if they've got a

33
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,240
program like this where they kind of

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,680
look into the the family tree of some uh

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,840
minor celebrity or major celebrity

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,799
celebrity sometimes i know it's a thing

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,479
here in ireland i know it's the thing in

38
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,600
uh in the uk and so and i understand the

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,320
program has been syndicated all over

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,119
so

41
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,840
um the this session is a short session

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,159
and there's absolutely tons of really

43
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,880
interesting stuff um to get through so i

44
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,520
don't know quite how far i'm gonna get

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,799
um

46
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,960
the inspiration behind this

47
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,920
session is there are a bunch of folk who

48
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,880
have been working for decades now

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,920
on

50
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,960
the standards and on information sharing

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,360
on the standards and uh on the

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,239
organizations um that

53
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,000
that that exists and they've evolved

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,520
from each other a little bit like a

55
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,599
family tree

56
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,080
and i'm really interested in the people

57
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,720
side of that who were the people why did

58
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,440
one standard

59
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,400
kind of

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
trump another standard over time what

61
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,160
organizations seem to work in some

62
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,959
contexts and which don't in others and a

63
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,080
few years ago now i wrote a short paper

64
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,640
for a journal about this topic

65
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,720
and then got asked to write a chapter of

66
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,400
a book the oxford

67
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,160
handbook on cyber security on the same

68
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,120
topic

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
and

70
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,920
i have a question as to whether there's

71
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
enough information here to turn into a

72
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,599
book um i certainly don't have enough

73
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,360
time to write one

74
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,680
so for a lot of you in here you'll

75
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
know aspects of this some people in here

76
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,720
know

77
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,480
some of the aspects in real detail but

78
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,159
i'm just gonna in the 30 minutes gonna

79
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,040
skirt around uh what it is that i'm

80
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,760
trying to pull together here

81
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,280
my inspiration i don't know how well you

82
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,400
can see that there was a fantastic book

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,959
called brit soft which was a a an oral

84
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,280
history of home computing or video games

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,480
in the uk

86
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,159
in the 1980s and 1990s and it doesn't

87
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,599
try to be

88
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,840
you know an academically accurate uh

89
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,080
history it's the stories of the people

90
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,360
who are involved in it it's an

91
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,560
absolutely fantastic read if you're

92
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,480
involved in it or kind of have that kind

93
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,720
of uh remember remembering of what it

94
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,280
was like with the zx spectrums and so on

95
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,760
and the commodores and the ataris and

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,959
all of that it's all about the people

97
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,159
who are writing the games and the

98
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,920
excitement of doing it then i absolutely

99
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,599
love this book

100
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,840
and in my head there's something like

101
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,360
this for

102
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,560
cyber threat intelligence for

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,239
information showing maybe there isn't

104
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,920
maybe it's not really that interesting

105
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,519
to people other than me or a few of us

106
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,120
so i'm going to touch on standards i've

107
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,400
got a bit at the end which is to do with

108
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,760
organizations i think i'm not going to

109
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,080
get there just because of um time

110
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,280
pressures so i'm going to take a little

111
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,200
bit of a kind of tour through

112
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,560
um in in slightly inspired by the kind

113
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,599
of family tree side of things so if we

114
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,320
take the leaf of this family tree this

115
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,440
is our

116
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,600
minor celebrity that we're going to

117
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,040
start off with i'm not going to in the

118
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,080
same way

119
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,440
that on the

120
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,960
television program they don't really

121
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,440
look into the life of the um minor

122
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,040
celebrity that they're

123
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,320
that they're looking at the the

124
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,600
predecessors of i'm not going to talk

125
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,960
about mitral attack at all i'm sure

126
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,880
there's loads of sessions um that are

127
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,960
going on and much more better informed

128
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,320
people than i to talk about mitral

129
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,240
attack but i'm going to start with mitra

130
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,639
attack as the leaf and these standards

131
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,040
i'm going to look at some how or other

132
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,880
map around the family tree to that leaf

133
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,520
and i'm going to start off

134
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,800
with

135
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,000
cve

136
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,600
so there's a couple of routes that i

137
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,840
might have taken and you'll see uh see

138
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,320
for yourself where these um where these

139
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,440
standards

140
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,440
took there i've just realized

141
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,560
yeah give me a sec

142
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,840
there's a couple of routes that we might

143
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,440
have taken so i've started out

144
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,720
deliberately

145
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,400
with cv i'm going to have to grab my

146
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,400
notes

147
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,280
when i said i didn't want this to be an

148
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,639
accurate history what i don't want to do

149
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,759
is get the dates wrong because the

150
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,520
date's pretty important so i can't

151
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,880
remember all the dates off the top of my

152
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,240
head so

153
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,000
i'm gonna have this here just so i can

154
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,400
follow along

155
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,960
um so

156
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,520
sorry

157
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,840
perfect

158
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
right there we go

159
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,919
i didn't think this through

160
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:02,720
um

161
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,039
so starting off with cve a lot of you'll

162
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,400
understand the standards a load of a

163
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,240
bunch of work has been done um over the

164
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,479
last few years around um

165
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,880
cve but of the standards uh and i'm

166
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,160
really interested for those you've got

167
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,319
more information on this

168
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,960
the cve standard is one of the ones that

169
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,240
i think represents an early route into

170
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
the standards that

171
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,520
we

172
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,359
are sharing no i'm confusing myself

173
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,919
so

174
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,600
i'm going to skip past that not go into

175
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,759
that into too much detail but then we

176
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,160
have another standard which actually if

177
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
we look back at the um

178
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,639
the timeline is a very early standard

179
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,440
and very interesting um i think in the

180
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,280
field of cyber cyber security in

181
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,800
particular to see

182
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,919
an early involvement

183
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,039
of a woman

184
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,919
involved in the standards and so i think

185
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,599
really important to highlight the

186
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,599
involvement of a woman in this standard

187
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,360
so the real time

188
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,160
internet work defense um

189
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
something that became a standard was a

190
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,440
response to a call for a for a

191
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,680
sans conference originally

192
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,759
really quite some really quite some time

193
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,479
ago became a standard around 2010

194
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,520
and

195
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,199
got folded into the work behind the

196
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,120
behind iodef

197
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,039
which i think the first version of the

198
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,560
iodef standard

199
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,479
was in

200
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:31,680
2007. i don't know whether there are

201
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,160
folk in here who are involved in the

202
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,400
in the um

203
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,639
uh early production of that standard and

204
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,560
i'm not really sure what the original

205
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,199
the kind of the trace into

206
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,120
the i o deaf was i have a feeling it was

207
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,479
something to do with a standard that was

208
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,759
being proposed or a mechanism to improve

209
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,080
uh collaboration between

210
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,639
eu certs um so there was a working group

211
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,560
the inch working group the inch working

212
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,240
group in fact

213
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,080
went to fold in some of the work that

214
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,560
had been done previously in

215
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,199
rid into the

216
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,759
into that

217
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,160
into that standard

218
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,800
excuse me

219
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,479
i'm not going to go into this there's

220
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,560
some detail in here around the kind of

221
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,080
structure i guess the thing to say is

222
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,759
that the iodef

223
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,599
standard of course

224
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,760
was expressed as an

225
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,640
xml schema

226
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,799
and then um i haven't been mentioning

227
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,919
the names as i've been going along

228
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,679
actually um

229
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,040
when we come to uh the

230
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,920
resource-oriented lightweight

231
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,240
information exchange rowley so i've got

232
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,680
a picture here of john field i don't

233
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,279
know whether um

234
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,640
john's turn up here there are a bunch of

235
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,560
folk who are involved there walter and

236
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,360
bang

237
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,720
hart and the um

238
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,000
the work here

239
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,160
um was building on the work that had

240
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,519
been done by iodef as a kind of

241
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,920
a protocol for shipping iodef around

242
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,760
i'm really confusing myself here i'm

243
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,279
clicking on this one and this one at the

244
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,480
same time so

245
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,240
apologies for the slightly clown-like

246
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,519
behavior

247
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,560
um

248
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,839
open ioc another standard and um it's

249
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,720
uh this these these standards um when um

250
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,480
i started doing some work with what was

251
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,640
then uk in the uk each of these

252
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,000
standards was being used across

253
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,560
different parts of

254
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,000
uk government

255
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,880
and

256
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,360
there's probably still bits of

257
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,040
organizations that are still using some

258
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,839
of these standards now so open ioc iodef

259
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,760
were being used in different

260
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,040
as different

261
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,160
sort of

262
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,240
standards that were being used

263
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,680
within those same

264
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,959
organizations so open ioc

265
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,480
started out as a proprietary protocol

266
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,079
within um

267
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,680
within mandiant and then in 2011 was

268
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,720
released as under an apache license as

269
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,360
an

270
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,440
uh open source

271
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,320
by

272
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,279
doug wilson who was then of uh mandiant

273
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,920
done again

274
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,200
now this is something i don't know very

275
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,040
much about so if anybody does know

276
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,320
anything about this i'm really keen to

277
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,600
find out more about this standard

278
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,760
because it seems on the on the face of

279
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,959
it

280
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,839
that there are um

281
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,760
that there are some real

282
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,480
parallels with the kind of um

283
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,800
the problems that rid was trying to

284
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,040
solve so this is the

285
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,680
ddos open threat signaling architecture

286
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,480
as i said looks a lot like

287
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,519
rid and it again eventually became rfc

288
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,519
881

289
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,440
for those of you in here early may have

290
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,519
uh spot the face i don't know whether

291
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,760
tom tom's in the room probably in a more

292
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,640
interesting talk somewhere else um so

293
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,399
tom um

294
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,440
tom

295
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,880
millar back in 2011. was looking at

296
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,320
trying to

297
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,600
coordinate

298
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,800
an effort um in the organization that's

299
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,399
now scissor to use iodef to pull

300
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,160
together

301
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,320
what he described as the alphabet soup

302
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,959
of different mitre standards and formats

303
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,760
that existed so cve kpec

304
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,800
um mac um

305
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,680
etc and

306
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,839
as it was reported to be in by tom

307
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,680
actually i def

308
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,800
wasn't

309
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,079
being used in the us um in federal

310
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,760
agencies and was not being picked up

311
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,480
really very successfully

312
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,279
and

313
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,040
it's interesting to try and understand

314
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,600
uh what it was about the stand about

315
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,920
that standard that meant that it wasn't

316
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,000
um that it wasn't being picked up

317
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,160
there's some spec speculation that it's

318
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,760
um because

319
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,639
iodef has incident in the

320
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,720
um in the title perhaps um it put off

321
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,279
private sector participants who thought

322
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,920
that if they were to um report on an

323
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,360
incident then

324
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,240
uh you know they may be uh liable in

325
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,120
some way legally for the incident and

326
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,720
subsequently of course there's been the

327
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,079
cisa act in the u.s which tried to put

328
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,399
in place some protections to ensure that

329
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,399
those people who did share

330
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,160
didn't

331
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,560
had some protections against liability

332
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,199
proceedings

333
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,399
so uh late in december in uh uh 2011 um

334
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,120
oh god i've done it again ridiculous

335
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,880
um i should have just done it on my own

336
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,040
mac uh

337
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,240
richard strews who is then working

338
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,600
in the same

339
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,000
same organization

340
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,480
started work on what now has of course

341
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,079
become

342
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,519
sticks and

343
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,200
uh taxi

344
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,040
and um

345
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,399
the

346
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,959
little anecdote uh that certainly made

347
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,000
um certainly made me laugh at the time

348
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,600
was that uh and tom wood tells it very

349
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,639
well

350
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,320
was that on the day that they were

351
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,560
talking about what it what it was that

352
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,279
they were going to call this uh new um

353
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,279
standard that they were going to work on

354
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,440
um tom was kind of counting on his

355
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,519
figure fingers there was a proposal to

356
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,920
call it ermick's um

357
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,440
and

358
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,000
tom was dead set against the name for uh

359
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,760
didn't think it sounded uh didn't think

360
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,480
it sounded like it was going to be

361
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
picked up upon and so actually kind of

362
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,639
carrying on his fingers actually

363
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,680
came up with a taxi and

364
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,399
i think uh as he describes it

365
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,000
the next day

366
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,920
um had a logo

367
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,160
which is the logo that you see

368
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,079
the logo that you see here and um

369
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,040
the the rest is history of course over

370
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,320
time what's happened with sticks and

371
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,959
taxi they started out as a as an idea

372
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,800
they started out as work that was being

373
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,040
done

374
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,839
uh by mitre and then eventually

375
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,399
went through to oasis and through from

376
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,560
oasis went uh

377
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,560
and became a

378
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,880
um initially starting as a specification

379
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,079
and ultimately becoming a standard

380
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,680
are you okay with that one

381
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,839
so part of the work lots of work

382
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,199
happened there and i just wanted to

383
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,279
mention in passing another another

384
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,959
standard as i go through this really

385
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,680
fast cancer through all these um through

386
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,000
all these different standards

387
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,399
the cyber observable expression

388
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,680
cybox

389
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,920
in the um

390
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,560
in sticks to the work that trey who's

391
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,680
here

392
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,959
did

393
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,519
the herculean task as i think as tom

394
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,839
described it was to um

395
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,279
to ensure that uh cybox was entirely

396
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,199
folded into

397
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,240
what is

398
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,600
um

399
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,040
sticks will stick standard

400
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,880
and again for those of you who were in

401
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,680
the

402
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,680
previous session you'll have heard about

403
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
the background of tlp so i won't go into

404
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,040
that into too much detail i mentioned

405
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,240
that because a lot of what i've talked

406
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,839
about today has been kind of originated

407
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,759
or a goodly bunch of it has been kind of

408
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,680
originated in the us

409
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,959
and of course the tlp standard as uh tom

410
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,959
uh explained in some details actually

411
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,440
originated in the uk

412
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,920
in an organization called or was what

413
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,839
was then called nicey

414
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,120
became cpni and which is part of which

415
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,600
is now folded into the uk's national

416
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,440
cyber security center

417
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,639
and this is out of date of course

418
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,600
because it doesn't say clear

419
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,560
tlp white

420
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,160
so i am

421
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,839
going to go on to talk a little bit

422
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,720
about the

423
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,199
the organization side of things so

424
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,480
that's the

425
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,639
the tree that i'm starting to try and

426
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,880
pull together information on i've tried

427
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
to keep it um

428
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,839
super

429
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,759
concise here

430
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,279
there's obviously loads more people and

431
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,279
loads more information around

432
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,360
around all of those and it's

433
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,759
it's fascinating to me and important i

434
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,279
think that those people who've worked on

435
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,560
those things kind of um it's recognized

436
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,399
the work that they've done and how

437
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,880
the work that they've done has led into

438
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,480
the um

439
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,880
into the work uh that's

440
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,399
uh you know the current the current

441
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,600
standards and kind of set the standard

442
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,160
over the years

443
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,600
okay so organizations this is a a

444
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,480
similar kind of quick uh canter through

445
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,079
um a whole load of different

446
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,279
organizations and i'm going to start out

447
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,279
with

448
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,240
with

449
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,759
cert

450
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,400
so

451
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,760
um

452
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,000
the computer emergency response team as

453
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,760
it was called then the

454
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,359
coordination center

455
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,000
cc uh was set up in

456
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,480
1988

457
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,720
and um

458
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,919
as a

459
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,039
response all after the um

460
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,240
uh morris worm so of course over 30 uh

461
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,480
30 years ago

462
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,720
and um

463
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,919
a few years after that um in 1990 when

464
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,320
it was initially just for uh the us

465
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,200
first was started and uh cert of course

466
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,559
was started as a mechanism for

467
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,160
coordinating uh the resp

468
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,880
uh responses around the

469
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,400
us

470
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,600
and

471
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,960
first started

472
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,200
initially as i understand it because of

473
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,240
the wide geography of

474
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,400
north america to enable coordination

475
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,799
across uh dif different teams across

476
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,520
large geographies and time zones uh but

477
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,039
by 1992 had um

478
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,000
become international and i'm sure

479
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,720
uh these figures are completely out of

480
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,840
date

481
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,440
already and you'll have seen up-to-date

482
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,200
versions of these over the course of the

483
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,280
last day and we'll see them

484
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,960
over the course of the next few

485
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,840
few days too

486
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,320
so what other sharing organizations have

487
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,760
existed there's quite a lot in here

488
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,679
about what goes on in the u.s and i'm

489
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,600
particularly interested to augment that

490
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,480
with i've got information about um the

491
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,360
us the uk and

492
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,280
a small number of other countries i'm

493
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,520
i'm particularly interested to know how

494
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,840
these things relate to the activities

495
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,360
that have happened in the countries that

496
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,799
you're from

497
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,919
um

498
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,559
so infragard again

499
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,799
just looking at dates started out in a

500
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,559
field office in

501
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,840
cleveland ohio in 1996

502
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,480
and then went on to

503
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,720
have an infragard office in

504
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,799
every one of the field offices

505
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,840
of the 56 field offices

506
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,679
and

507
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,520
was an important

508
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,160
mechanism for coordinating local cyber

509
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,160
activities

510
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,480
so uh 1998 what happened in 1988 uh

511
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,799
clinton signed a presidential decision

512
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,039
directive um nsc 63

513
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,000
uh on the 22nd of may which was a

514
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,600
um for

515
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,360
critical infrastructure protection and

516
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,960
it was that this

517
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,200
that led to the creation of ice axe

518
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,600
actually the wording of the

519
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,240
uh pdd talks about

520
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,160
the creation of a private sector

521
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,840
information sharing and our center isac

522
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,720
and of course there are now multiple i i

523
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,760
sacks but

524
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,880
certainly the way it was worded

525
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,440
originally it talked about it as if

526
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
it's worded as if there were only

527
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,720
uh there were only one

528
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,120
and actually just thinking 1998 i don't

529
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,320
know whether that sounds like a long

530
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,360
time ago

531
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,720
or um just uh the other day but it's

532
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,640
incredible to think it was of course

533
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,960
windows 98 it was the year google was

534
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,799
founded and it was also the year of the

535
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,840
good friday agreement

536
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,039
so um the national i said there are a

537
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,919
number of ice acts and um uh the last

538
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,880
time uh i looked there were kind of 26

539
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,720
member ice axe in the national council

540
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,200
of isaac so having had the um the

541
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,320
original

542
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,200
um

543
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,200
uh the original isaac formed pretty much

544
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,960
uh straight after

545
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,120
the uh pdd

546
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,919
uh

547
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,280
there are now

548
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,240
over

549
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,039
uh 26 or there are 26 members in the

550
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,679
national council of ice axe

551
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,679
the financial services ice ax which is

552
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,000
sort of the um the grand daddy of them

553
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,360
all um was founded in 1990

554
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,159
was founded in 1999 so

555
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,039
was the the first and for for some

556
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,559
considerable time was the largest

557
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,640
single sector sharing organization

558
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,520
globally in fact

559
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,039
then in um

560
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,960
2013 firstly obama signed an executive

561
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,400
order which was to create a different

562
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,039
type of organization which uh

563
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,640
was and is called a

564
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,799
an iso

565
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,919
and uh the rationale for setting up

566
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,440
those isos those ice hours was multiple

567
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,400
so the ice ax

568
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,240
in some ways were seen

569
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,760
to um

570
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,120
they were very uh are very focused um

571
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,360
for them for the most part sectorally

572
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,799
and so uh very heavily vertical and so

573
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,720
part of the rationale for setting up the

574
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,480
isos was to kind of have

575
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,520
um for those um cross-cutting concerns

576
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,159
that touched upon many verticals was to

577
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,480
allow for that type of collaboration it

578
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,559
was also to allow to try and foster more

579
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,200
collaboration or sharing um with the

580
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,280
federal with the federal government to

581
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,840
try and instill more sharing in that

582
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,000
regard um and in fact a kind of

583
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,200
follow-on from that in 2015 was the um

584
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,720
um the cisa act the one i mentioned

585
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,039
earlier which was about the protections

586
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,840
um and within the isos there was

587
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,039
built in

588
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,679
the the kind of mechanisms uh as i

589
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,919
understand it to allow

590
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,120
um to allow for folk to be to have more

591
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,280
sensitive information uh shared with

592
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,039
them uh through

593
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,679
ensuring that some folk got the adequate

594
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,200
security clearance to allow for that

595
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,799
and then in the u.s there's a bunch of

596
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,600
uh

597
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,880
different

598
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,400
mechanisms for

599
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,240
uh sharing so i wanted to

600
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,760
touch on a few of these and i'm afraid

601
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,960
there may be somebody in the room who

602
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,760
knows how to how the acronyms are all

603
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,039
pronounced here

604
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,880
um uh i don't know whether this is

605
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,360
pronounced as sisby

606
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,480
perhaps

607
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,679
so this is one of the mechanisms which

608
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,799
scissor in the u.s has for the

609
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,480
sharing of

610
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,000
the kind of private

611
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,120
public

612
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,320
sharing of information

613
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,039
and also there's the homeland security

614
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,440
information network network hisan and um

615
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,320
the

616
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,360
as i understand it hison is

617
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,200
used as a portal

618
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,520
for particularly

619
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,400
those organizations which form parts of

620
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,679
critical national infrastructure

621
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,559
so in the uk as i mentioned cpni earlier

622
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,559
the uk defines 13 areas 13 sectors as

623
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,400
being sectors

624
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,919
of

625
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,279
critical national infrastructure and

626
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,520
each country

627
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,080
that i've looked into so far has a a

628
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,120
slightly

629
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,000
um

630
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,880
often a similar number of

631
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,039
uh sectors which are critical national

632
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,200
infrastructure and not always entirely

633
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,919
overlapping and it's interesting to see

634
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,799
how in some uh countries uh

635
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,720
things are promoted to to be seen as

636
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,960
critical national infrastructure um in

637
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,640
their own right and in other countries

638
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,039
form part a sub-part of

639
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,480
um of other

640
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,960
of other um sectors

641
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,799
so in the uk

642
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,919
um

643
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,520
cpni or

644
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,080
part of the what was the activities that

645
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,159
were performed by cpni that related to

646
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,760
cyber security in particular have now

647
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,400
for a few years been folded into the

648
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,640
national cyber security center the

649
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,360
national cyber security center

650
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,520
as many of you i'm sure will be aware

651
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,039
brought together

652
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,120
what previously had been a number of

653
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,440
different organizations uh in the uk

654
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,919
that had responsibility for different

655
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,600
types of um

656
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,440
sharing so cs cesg

657
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,000
which formed part

658
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,640
you know information assurance part of

659
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,320
the uk signals intelligence agency gchq

660
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,000
gov cert the responsibility of

661
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,840
governments to look after

662
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,159
the government's networks and cert uk

663
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,200
when that was established form part was

664
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,520
the responsibility of cert uk

665
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,480
um was to look at the um

666
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,400
the kind of public-private partnership

667
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,679
across

668
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,559
across industry academia et cetera

669
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,960
and now um

670
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,559
most of the responsibilities of those

671
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,159
organizations and some others have been

672
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,320
folded into

673
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,799
the uk's national cyber security center

674
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,320
so

675
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,480
industry and government have one point

676
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,840
that they uh can go to in one one

677
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,600
responsible authority that they can go

678
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,000
to for matters relating to

679
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,880
cyber security

680
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,520
so what's changed what's changing um in

681
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,559
those organizations so in the uh in the

682
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,640
uk and in um

683
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,480
some of the those organizations that i

684
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,320
mentioned in the

685
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,919
uh us membership of a information

686
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,600
sharing organization is entirely

687
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,720
voluntary

688
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
membership of the fsi sac

689
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,159
comes with a fee

690
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,880
um in the uk if you're part of the um c

691
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,400
cis

692
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,840
public-private partnership that's

693
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,960
provided free of charge by ncsc as a

694
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,279
mechanism for sharing

695
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,400
but entirely voluntary but over the last

696
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,760
few years

697
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,559
the tide has turned slightly

698
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,080
and there's an increasing amount of

699
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,360
mandatory

700
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,799
sharing

701
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,799
and so within the us um the um

702
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,960
defense industrial base did

703
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,640
of course there are

704
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,399
this has changed quite a lot in fact

705
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,159
over the last couple of years to

706
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,760
increase the amount of

707
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,600
mandatory sharing i call it mandatory

708
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,080
sharing and i guess when you'll share it

709
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,000
when you're reporting instance um if

710
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,600
it's mandatory that's not really sharing

711
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,440
sharing kind of implies that you've got

712
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,840
some um

713
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
voluntary voluntary uh involvement in

714
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,240
that it's really incident reporting so

715
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,279
in certain circumstances it's mandatory

716
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,440
if you are a

717
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,000
supplier um on a federal

718
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,799
defense contract then you must notify

719
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,399
about certain

720
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,039
cyber incidents

721
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,679
in europe we've had

722
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,120
the nis directive and in fact

723
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,600
work is underway on

724
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,600
the kind of second generation of that

725
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,960
and

726
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,480
the nis

727
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,440
directive too

728
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,200
and the uk

729
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,840
has in its law um something which

730
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,399
basically mirrors precisely the

731
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,279
um

732
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,399
the nis directive and what that says is

733
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,200
that there are certain operators

734
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,080
of essential services that must under

735
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,760
circum certain circumstances um

736
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,880
report on incidents

737
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,640
and there's a bit of an overlap there

738
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,919
between

739
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,720
essential services and critical national

740
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,399
infrastructure although there's not a

741
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:45,000
one-to-one mapping certainly in the uk

742
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:46,960
another

743
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,200
example is within the state of new york

744
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,640
any

745
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,039
financial services company that operates

746
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,440
with a licence must

747
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,039
report

748
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,039
certain types of cyber incident and of

749
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,080
course

750
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,158
um all financial organizations have

751
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,120
globally will have some form of presence

752
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,799
in

753
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:11,679
in

754
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,640
new york and therefore actually

755
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,440
the um this mandatory requirement for

756
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,039
cyber security

757
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,120
or incident reporting

758
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,720
touches on a very large uh percentage of

759
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,520
the

760
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,640
um

761
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,320
of the financial

762
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,080
services industry

763
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,799
and this this trend is um this trend is

764
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,799
increasing and it's

765
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,720
certainly in the uk the way that that

766
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,720
splits out is it's interesting to see

767
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,399
how that's panning out and it's

768
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,399
interesting to see how that might be

769
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,720
affecting

770
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,279
the voluntary sharing of cyber security

771
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,480
information and so on the one hand the

772
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,080
organizations that we looked at earlier

773
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,320
which were entirely voluntary and rely

774
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,640
on voluntary effort

775
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,200
i have

776
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
have

777
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,360
no compulsion of course to share and in

778
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,399
the uk

779
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,240
the the

780
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,080
national cyber security center isn't a

781
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,840
regulator and so sharing information

782
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,159
with them reporting an incident isn't

783
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,159
reporting an incident under the nis

784
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,960
directive that requires

785
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,679
those operators to report to a regulator

786
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,440
which is a slightly different route so

787
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,559
there's a couple of issues there of

788
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,080
course on the one hand

789
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,600
if i'm an organization that's had an

790
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,679
incident am i going to be bothered to

791
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,159
report to both my regulator as i have to

792
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,679
by law and

793
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,159
to a

794
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,480
and to a voluntary arrangement

795
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,480
or am i um

796
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,520
am i just going to share uh or report

797
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,440
precisely what i need to

798
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,960
um

799
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,279
the things that are compulsory for me to

800
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,440
um for me to share

801
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,080
so that's one of the um the tensions

802
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,760
that i think that having

803
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,600
an increasing amount of

804
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,960
mandatory

805
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,519
reporting has

806
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,799
so my

807
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,360
ultimate aim and i think i'm probably by

808
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,559
the fact you've stood up and implies

809
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,840
that i'm coming up to the point where i

810
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,159
should stop and ask for questions

811
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,080
um the ultimate aim here as i said right

812
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,440
at the beginning is to try and pull

813
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,240
together this um and it's been very it's

814
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,880
hard to convey um the the stories of the

815
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,120
people um without really having the

816
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,960
people here and telling them telling

817
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,399
their own stories apart from trey who's

818
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,159
there i could tell you his story

819
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,760
um

820
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,600
my hope is to pull those together and to

821
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,600
pull together a sort of all history and

822
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,840
i don't know how

823
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,799
um uh

824
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,240
if any of you have seen these kind of

825
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,159
rock family trees where you know iron

826
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,039
maiden was um uh all of the different

827
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,960
drummers and guitarists who played for

828
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,080
them all for from some other for other

829
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,919
um rock bands uh my my aspiration is to

830
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,679
get to a point where i can sort of pull

831
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,360
together a family tree

832
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,919
that looks like a rock family tree but

833
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,440
do that for um information sharing

834
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,519
and um my

835
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,039
rationale for doing that as i said at

836
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,559
the beginning is to um allow

837
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,919
for the

838
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,399
work that those folk who've done

839
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,919
often in the shadows um and as labors of

840
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,480
love over you know in some cases

841
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,880
um not just years but decades to work on

842
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,279
these standards and these organizations

843
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,120
um that actually they kind of get their

844
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,159
day

845
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,159
their moment in the sun and the people

846
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,720
who are involved in it get their tales

847
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,200
told as well

848
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,080
and i think i'll leave it there

849
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,120
so

850
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,080
thank you to stuart i understand also

851
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,720
because it's related to the story of the

852
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,760
tv tv series all you are speaking for

853
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,720
there is any question

854
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,000
do you think we need another standard

855
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,240
yet

856
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,000
we need one standard to rule them all

857
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,080
uh it's i think it's clear that the uh

858
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,519
the

859
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,240
um the journey of those evolving

860
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,679
standards is never really gonna stop i

861
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,519
mean we just saw didn't we with tlp how

862
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,200
tlp had um is changing and i think the

863
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,279
message at the end was really and it's

864
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,120
gonna it's gonna change again so the

865
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,840
standards will have to keep on adapting

866
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,279
um you know some of the things that we

867
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,000
didn't talk about is you know why why

868
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,360
sticks versus iodef um you know was that

869
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,600
to do with uh increasing amounts of

870
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,679
automation allowing for more

871
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,679
um you know

872
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,320
machine to machine uh collaboration as

873
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,320
well as kind of human unstructured

874
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,080
sharing so

875
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,880
inevitably yes my if a book ever gets

876
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,320
published it will immediately be out of

877
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,559
date

878
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,640
sorry uh the question from the

879
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,080
microphone va

880
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,080
yeah it was more common so i'm a

881
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,880
co-chair of the iep information exchange

882
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,760
protocol uh special interest sig we just

883
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,799
met and so um we're restarting that work

884
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,039
um we're gonna enhance

885
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,240
good thumbs up

886
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,919
um and just wanted to let people be

887
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,480
aware of that

888
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,399
yeah and i think that that that happened

889
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,000
at exactly the same time that we were in

890
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,960
this room talking about the tlp so

891
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,119
yes that's an important standard as well

892
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,040
that um needs to form part of that tree

893
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,599
okay my question is uh what's your stand

894
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,000
on iso 27010

895
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,839
it was not mentioned here

896
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,159
but it's in the same direction was the

897
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,239
reason not to mention it here because

898
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,719
the technical which standard is that

899
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,560
sorry i saw two seven zero one zero yeah

900
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,239
actually i don't um i don't know

901
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,839
anything about this for over a decade

902
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,159
and i've never heard of that anybody oh

903
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,040
yeah

904
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,040
so yes absolutely my ignorance the

905
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,639
things that are missing here are

906
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,560
completely down to my ignorance i think

907
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,159
there's a good people as well from a

908
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,560
misp team because we mapped how

909
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,879
misposter platform can be used in the

910
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,839
environment of that standard

911
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,839
um

912
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,599
i guess the key thing to say is i'm

913
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,079
really uh it's i'm keen to get more info

914
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,480
uh information and add in the some of

915
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,400
the missing bits so thank you uh thank

916
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,560
you for that i'll try and uh plug that

917
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,680
gap with some more knowledge and of

918
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,040
course misp has its own um standard way

919
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,240
of representing information

920
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,160
one last question uh it wasn't a

921
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,599
question it was i can give you another

922
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,520
great great grandparent

923
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,520
which is where i owe dad what came

924
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,119
before iodef

925
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,079
uh which i think first appears in roc

926
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,040
3067 that came out of some work sorry

927
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,320
andrew cormac

928
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,400
that came out of some work that

929
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,880
i did with surfnac

930
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,200
the dutch research network

931
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,359
as soon as i started in the community so

932
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,960
1999

933
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,680
where we were trying to compare incident

934
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,119
statistics

935
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,119
so it was originally about exchanging

936
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,440
statistics and trying to agree a

937
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,280
definition of

938
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,920
what was an incident what kinds of

939
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,280
incidents were

940
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,839
useful and comparable

941
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:20,880
and

942
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,280
that then grew into okay can we actually

943
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,079
use some sort of protocol for live

944
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,560
incidents not just statistics uh so that

945
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,079
was the that takes you back one step

946
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,800
beyond 3067. thank you very much and

947
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,760
actually my real reason for um wanting

948
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,359
to stand up here and talk through this

949
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,440
was exactly that was to find out where

950
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,800
the gaps were so

951
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,960
we can pull that and hope to pull some

952
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,480
of that information together because you

953
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,119
know there's a uh it only goes back as

954
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,720
as far as my limited understanding at

955
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,720
the moment so thank you for i have no

956
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,160
idea whether i've got any of that

957
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,000
documentation because i was a mac user

958
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,880
in those days right

959
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,480
thank you for a question thank you

960
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,480
stuart a big applause for him thank you
