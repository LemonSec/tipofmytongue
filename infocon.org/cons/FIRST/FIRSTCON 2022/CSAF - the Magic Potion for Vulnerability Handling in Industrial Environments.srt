1
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,800
okay uh it's time so let us start

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,519
um i'm in yusuke masala with physicist

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,720
system integration laboratories and i'm

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,600
a research principal

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,480
doing rcta research

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,080
i'm honored to host this talk

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,320
by

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,800
uh toby

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,320
toby and

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,800
thomas

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,520
so uh

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,440
top uh tobias slimmer

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,640
oh okay maybe i i should go first with

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,239
thomas and

15
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,600
thomas perrault

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,480
uh tom is working for siemens in product

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,160
security for 15 years after five years

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,160
of penetration tests

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,680
testing he changed size and he is now

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,320
leading the incident hunting and

21
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,360
vulnerability response team for siemens

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,119
product thought

23
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,320
okay and

24
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,560
tobias lemmer

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,439
toby

26
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,759
being involved in the field of security

27
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,280
since 20 years ago toby has been

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,080
focusing on the industrial side of idea

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,799
infrastructure structure for over 10

30
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,840
years

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,119
now

32
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,320
starting with a viola verdi hunting

33
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,280
in gman's product third he was

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,840
very involved

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,079
into the

36
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,119
automation of security tests

37
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,759
and tests right and

38
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,479
now one of his research area is two

39
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,280
based vulnerability management and

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,320
risk-based mitigation decisions and he

41
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,600
likes french comics okay

42
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,520
it says so here

43
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,719
okay so uh the title of the talk is a

44
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,920
sisaf

45
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,000
the magic portion for vulnerability

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
hunting in industry and industrial

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,760
environments so the flow is yours thank

48
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,560
you

49
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,480
thank you

50
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,319
thanks for the introduction

51
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,760
um

52
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,440
so csef

53
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,760
that's an abbreviation for the common

54
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,480
security advisory format

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,160
you see audio okay

56
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
yeah okay

57
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,720
common security advisory format

58
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,319
and

59
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,280
why we think this is the magic portion

60
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,680
of um vulnerability handling i will

61
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,599
describe in the next few slides

62
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,160
okay we are talking about

63
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,560
industrial environments and we just

64
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,160
heard the talk about

65
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,480
tapco

66
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,239
they are special in industrial

67
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,159
environments they are not the office

68
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,319
environments that you guys

69
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,640
might know every day

70
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
they differ in many many different

71
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,720
aspects and there's hard to give a

72
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,360
general overview over that because um

73
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,080
hospitals look completely different than

74
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,319
oil rigs that we see here

75
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,400
and they look different to a water

76
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,959
treatment plant or whatnot but they have

77
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,959
some things in common

78
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,680
so for example uh they used to be

79
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,959
aircapped air gap means we do not have

80
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,280
any connection to the internet i heard

81
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,400
this so many times from from

82
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,599
people running those plants they told me

83
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,920
no no connection no cable nothing

84
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,080
nothing nothing

85
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,080
that could have been true 20 years ago

86
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,680
but in the meantime

87
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,000
we realized that they want to have

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,599
remote service

89
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,480
they want to have data exchange with it

90
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,920
for example for tax reasons so how many

91
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,840
products did you deliver

92
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,920
in the last

93
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,000
month or so they need to give their

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,959
actual numbers to i.t to order to

95
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,319
process to pay taxes

96
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,720
and this is why they

97
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,000
pulled cables between ot and it put a

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,519
firewall there

99
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,839
concentrate it on the parameter

100
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,159
and all was good you could think

101
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,199
however

102
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,759
they want to have or

103
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,680
they are on the way

104
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,160
to further improve to further integrate

105
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,400
but there are some obstacles for example

106
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,560
the long hardware life we heard from

107
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,840
from tabco 30 years for some

108
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,479
devices that's that's quite common

109
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,360
in

110
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,600
oil and gas that's quite common also in

111
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,919
hospitals

112
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,759
you have huge investments for those

113
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,360
devices and you don't throw them out

114
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,080
after a few years

115
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,479
you also have no online updates and you

116
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,479
have no central management

117
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,280
like active directory or so it's very

118
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,000
rare to find in those environments

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,199
so the integrated security

120
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,560
i have to cross out unfortunately so

121
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,600
this does not work today at least

122
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,880
um and today these people are still

123
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,479
bound to manual patching and manual

124
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,840
management so there are still many

125
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,440
usb drives

126
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,000
going in and out of those those

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,479
factories

128
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,840
many

129
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,800
excel sheets with assets going forth and

130
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,440
back there's very few automation there

131
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,759
let's see how this works in it and there

132
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,039
are my role models in it i put here

133
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,840
three big vendors this is a cisco

134
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,039
microsoft and oracle

135
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,400
and i evaluated how many cves they

136
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,560
published per year

137
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,400
and

138
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,960
you see that this grew over the last 20

139
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,000
years

140
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,080
so when you look at at cisco for example

141
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,919
they started with around 50

142
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,479
vulnerabilities per year

143
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,360
in 2002

144
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,039
and they are around 600 vulnerabilities

145
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,520
per year today

146
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,560
microsoft also had a huge growth they

147
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,520
started from 100 and end up on 1 000

148
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,000
over 20 years and same with oracle and

149
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,680
same with basically

150
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,960
every

151
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,919
uh professional big

152
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,080
software company out there and these are

153
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,720
my role models so when i'm in siemens

154
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,600
product when when when

155
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,160
i think where would i be in five years i

156
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,479
say i want to be there with a thousand

157
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,880
vulnerabilities found

158
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,639
fixed and published that would be

159
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,000
awesome

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,479
because currently in ot it looks like

161
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,880
that it's not the same scale

162
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,840
you see

163
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,080
on that side siemens we ramped up like

164
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,280
everybody does we rent up from around 50

165
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,560
vulnerabilities a year

166
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
until 300

167
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,319
in 10 years

168
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,479
and the others follow

169
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,720
you see the the trend

170
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,199
like in the i.t world it goes up

171
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,560
however

172
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,759
the ot world is basically approximately

173
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,759
10 years behind the idea

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,479
the question is

175
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,840
will this manual approach that currently

176
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,160
takes place in the industry this manual

177
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,360
patching

178
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,720
this manual

179
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,759
configuration management etc will this

180
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,199
prevail in future and i have my doubts

181
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,080
so no matter which which metric i i use

182
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,599
i had have two different here

183
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,560
manual processing of advisories will

184
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,919
probably not scale

185
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,879
probably does not scale today even

186
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,039
but if you look into the future it will

187
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,160
not prevail in the future

188
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,120
this is an important slide

189
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,160
you will see this slide growing over our

190
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,960
presentation and this is why i take some

191
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,120
some time to explain it

192
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,479
what you see here on the left side

193
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,879
are the advisory creators

194
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,879
that could be siemens that could be any

195
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,440
other vendor who writes security

196
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,799
advisories

197
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,519
and he has some tools

198
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,799
and

199
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,399
there is a certain

200
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,880
outcome in the quality of the advisories

201
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,680
and on the right side of the screen you

202
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,560
see the advisory consumers

203
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,399
they also have to do something with the

204
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,959
advisory that are created and now let's

205
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,200
look at the at the first

206
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,279
first level of maturity that we have

207
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,839
we created our first advisories with

208
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,519
microsoft word

209
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,000
so really an office application as as

210
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,160
the tool of choice

211
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,120
and yeah we write dear sir

212
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,200
we have a vulnerability

213
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,800
in this product

214
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,399
and

215
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,040
then what came out was a human readable

216
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,440
advisory which has a nice logo and it's

217
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,240
a document and we could distribute it

218
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,320
and that was really the first step of

219
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,240
vulnerability handling

220
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,080
and

221
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,640
the people consuming those advisories

222
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,440
all they needed was a web browser

223
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,600
coming to our website coming to a

224
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,920
different website finding our

225
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,920
our advisory and reading it and manually

226
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,040
acting upon it

227
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,080
this step sounds trivial

228
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,200
but

229
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,040
in reality we see some companies

230
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,680
who on both sides some

231
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,399
some people who should create advisories

232
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,839
and they don't

233
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,240
and we also see some people who should

234
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,800
read advisories and they don't

235
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,160
so so the first step as as trivial as it

236
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,200
seems

237
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,040
is a challenge for

238
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,200
for quite some and this is a challenge

239
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,000
that we took for around 10 years now

240
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,959
but we really got to the next step

241
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,279
we finally set up a content management

242
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,399
systems

243
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,839
where we have

244
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,839
products in a database and

245
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,160
vulnerabilities in a database and then

246
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,680
we connect them

247
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,680
and say this product is affected by that

248
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,120
vulnerability

249
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,519
and this could now

250
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,959
be generated into a json a machine

251
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,920
readable advisory format so now we have

252
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,560
not some random structure some random

253
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,040
data in a in a word file

254
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,480
but really structured data that can be

255
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,040
parsed and structurally read by a

256
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,480
machine

257
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,160
and with these machine readable

258
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,760
advisories

259
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,720
on the creator side

260
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,279
there is action needed on the consumer

261
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,120
side because it does not make sense when

262
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,720
we make those machine readable

263
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,200
advisories and nobody reads it so for

264
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,120
the consumers

265
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,040
it will go

266
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,279
into ramping up their automation as well

267
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,279
and how we do this

268
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,360
will be the part of toby

269
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,720
whom i pass

270
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,600
the pointer yeah

271
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,720
so i will just skip back to the previous

272
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,200
slide here so uh if you look at all of

273
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,040
that so so i mean you could ask yourself

274
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,920
so in it it worked over the last 20

275
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,560
years quite well

276
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,959
why do we need something different in ot

277
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,680
so so if you look at also the typical ot

278
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,600
environments you do not have central

279
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,279
management you do not have the typical

280
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,600
online updates if you look at the

281
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,760
typical standard operating systems you

282
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,440
have everything included it's easy to

283
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,480
update

284
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,639
and this is what we don't have within ot

285
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,200
and as tom already said so

286
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,279
we have asset management in ot but

287
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,120
usually it's also a manual process we've

288
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,000
got typical yeah excel spreadsheets and

289
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,079
that's very common actually inside the

290
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,639
typical industrial environments so it's

291
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,880
hard for our yeah customers actually to

292
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,279
digest the information to digest all the

293
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,200
different vulnerability information and

294
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,440
take action on it and that's a problem

295
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,320
in ot and it's not only one vendor it's

296
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,040
not only us it's many other vendors as

297
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,880
well that are integrated within one

298
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,120
single environment actually and this is

299
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,040
a problem for many customers and this is

300
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,600
why we're looking for a way actually how

301
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,519
can we automate that and how can we

302
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,399
design that as open and as openly as

303
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,360
possible

304
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,720
so um

305
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,399
and for us actually csef

306
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,440
the common security advisory format is

307
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,320
the solution for all of that and

308
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,560
oasis has a technical

309
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,399
technical committee who is uh

310
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,320
standardizing that at the moment uh

311
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,279
we're at uh the committee specification

312
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,519
so it's uh

313
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,839
a a standard that is readily available

314
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,880
that you can use already and that's nice

315
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,560
actually everything is open source

316
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,480
everything is available and everybody

317
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,320
can really digest the data that we've

318
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,200
got here so you can see the github repo

319
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,959
link at the bottom you can even see all

320
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,120
the discussions that we have inside the

321
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,920
the the working group so everything is

322
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,560
open here and also ready to use

323
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,760
so

324
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,920
how does it look like so i will just

325
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,399
give you a brief example of how we are

326
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,320
doing it on our website if so if you go

327
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,560
to siemens concert advisories you will

328
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,639
see the list of advice series that we

329
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,920
already published and now it changed a

330
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,399
little bit because we put in a new link

331
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,959
here called csuf and here really you

332
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,639
have a machine readable version of all

333
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,399
of our advisories

334
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,440
actually

335
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,920
we have a link here but that's more for

336
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,440
marketing because usually you want to

337
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,360
use scripts to download all of that

338
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,120
everything is really contained in the

339
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,720
standard how you do that

340
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,199
how all of that is really automatable so

341
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,199
in the end you should not need to use

342
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,959
that link here you should really use

343
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,839
scripts to download everything here

344
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,000
how does it look like so one example is

345
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,199
shown here

346
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,360
of one of the advisories so if you click

347
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,160
on pdf or html you will exactly see that

348
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,920
uh document here

349
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,600
with the typical information that you

350
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,519
that you know from typical security

351
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,839
advisories so so you've got our title

352
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,760
publication date we've got a short

353
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,120
summary of uh one of that document with

354
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,320
one or multiple vulnerabilities and then

355
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,160
quite important here all the affected

356
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,320
products and versions

357
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,240
with corresponding remediation and here

358
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,680
you can see actually the problem we've

359
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,519
been talking about

360
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,720
you all of that is free text still we do

361
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,800
not use office applications anymore for

362
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,199
that so so it's a

363
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,120
an automated system in the background

364
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,959
but still it's free text that you've got

365
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,199
here and this is this needs to change

366
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,760
actually because uh if we have free text

367
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,720
uh

368
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,560
how also the different products are

369
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,720
named and uh the versioning scheme are

370
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
being used so that that's not

371
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,880
automatable so in uh

372
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,720
rather hard to process actually and this

373
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,440
is a problem so how does it look like

374
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,600
now with csaf so just a quick overview

375
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,240
so it's json based and essentially all

376
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,759
the information that you have in the

377
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,920
advisory you can also see here within

378
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,399
the different json fields so

379
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,160
here you've got the title again you've

380
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,199
got also the publisher you've got the

381
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,279
distribution how

382
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,160
the tlp labeling is actually

383
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,480
and usually we have

384
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,199
stlp labeling white because everything

385
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,680
is publicly available that we publish on

386
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,399
our website of course

387
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,759
here we have actually one policy within

388
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,519
siemens that

389
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,000
in cases of products where we do not

390
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,279
know all uses of so and this is usually

391
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,120
for typical products you can also buy on

392
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,240
amazon or wherever

393
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,160
there we publish the vulnerability

394
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,880
information and we have one exception if

395
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,120
you know all the customers and we've got

396
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,880
certain sectors where we actually know

397
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,360
all the customers for example for

398
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,800
trains

399
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,160
there we don't need to publish that

400
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,560
online and usually we don't

401
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
and this is why you usually only see

402
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,399
also advisories from the typical

403
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,040
products that are free on the market

404
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,560
that you can also buy yourself

405
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,480
further on we've got tracking ids inside

406
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,800
we've also got the revision history all

407
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,240
of that nicely standardized

408
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,320
if you look at single vulnerabilities

409
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,240
inside the json format you can see all

410
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,839
the cve so

411
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,320
for those who do not know cve it's the

412
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,160
common vulnerability enumeration it's a

413
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,319
unique id for each and every

414
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,480
vulnerability

415
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,400
that is being assigned so globally

416
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,720
unique so it's very nice so if you if

417
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,160
you want to correlate information also

418
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,559
from different sources

419
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,160
and then we've got

420
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,000
certain nodes here for example a summary

421
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,199
of the vulnerability then we've got also

422
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,480
cwe which is the common weakness

423
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,199
enumeration which describes actually the

424
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,679
type of the vulnerability itself here it

425
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,840
seems to be some kind of improper input

426
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,480
validation inside the code that causes

427
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,520
um the vulnerability itself and then uh

428
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,400
also very important here is the products

429
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,600
so and here uh this time this uh section

430
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,240
here shows you uh yeah what kind of

431
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,919
products are affected and it just

432
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,440
references other sections of the

433
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,679
document and down here you also have the

434
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,919
cvss score in that in the current

435
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,039
version here 3.1

436
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,720
depicting the severity of the

437
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,280
vulnerability so it goes from 0 to 10

438
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,600
and here we've got a space score from of

439
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,080
7.4 which is quite critical actually

440
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,679
so looking at the known affected

441
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,679
products there's another section inside

442
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,520
the document that tells you exactly okay

443
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,880
what kind of product is actually

444
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,520
affected here and here for example we've

445
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,240
got a scale ends i think it's an access

446
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,360
point

447
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,640
and all firmware versions of version 3.0

448
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,320
and lower are actually affected of that

449
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,120
vulnerability furthermore you also have

450
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,640
additional identification helpers so a

451
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,559
certain criteria where you could

452
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,080
actually identify the products

453
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,320
themselves um

454
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,039
yeah

455
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,799
in a simpler way i will go into more

456
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,039
detail about that later

457
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,039
so um

458
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,880
in the end we're considering all of that

459
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,280
our magic potion uh so so we like that a

460
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,919
lot everything is freely available we

461
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,840
can publish all of that it's easily

462
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,799
interpretable uh all interested people

463
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,039
all interested parties are able to read

464
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,880
that that's good so

465
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,640
it it it's essentially what would you

466
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,360
want to have so public advisories we

467
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,039
want to

468
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,120
also enable the collection

469
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,480
redistribution

470
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,880
and extension of those advisories so we

471
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,940
know of certain

472
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,240
[Music]

473
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,559
communities and also

474
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,720
parties actually collecting

475
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,240
different advisors from different

476
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,480
vendors so for example yeah we've got

477
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,880
caesar in the u.s we've got the bsi the

478
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,840
federal

479
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,720
office of information security who are

480
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,919
collecting

481
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,480
the advisories and also redistribute the

482
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,520
advisors to certain

483
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,720
users also in the ot realm

484
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,960
and in the end the goal should be that

485
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,799
uh yeah sharing is being fostered at the

486
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,960
moment we just have our single documents

487
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,520
and we really want to enable people i

488
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,280
want to enable the whole security

489
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,520
community to to do sharing and

490
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,799
essentially

491
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,559
do the typical threat intelligence

492
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,799
way of uh

493
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,840
communicating and providing information

494
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,720
so

495
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,159
at the moment there are a few so open

496
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,159
source tools available the standard is

497
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,679
quite new in its current version of 2.0

498
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,360
and um

499
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,840
it's it's mainly concentrating on yet

500
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,919
the publication of advisories so it

501
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,360
helps actually us the vendors to to

502
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,280
create those advisories in the csaf

503
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,880
format

504
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,760
more tools are in the pipeline so also

505
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,880
supporting consumers so actually people

506
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,240
who operate equipment

507
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,080
who have operate equipment and want to

508
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,760
know okay am i affected or not of a

509
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,000
certain vulnerability but it's it's

510
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,880
still uh in the flow so so we're uh

511
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,440
we're starting to work on that but

512
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,679
it will still take a little bit of time

513
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,480
are you aware that they published it

514
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,600
last week

515
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,000
10 new tools around

516
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,240
i was not aware actually so even for

517
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,400
consumers okay good to know thank you

518
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
so so a lot of activities happening in

519
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,480
that community and we really appreciate

520
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,200
that

521
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,880
so if you want to know more actually

522
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,600
there's a tutorial uh happening i think

523
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,919
right now by the federal office of

524
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,480
information security here at first so

525
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,159
you're too late if you want to know more

526
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,120
about uh i hope they're they're gonna uh

527
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,840
redo uh that uh tutorial in the future

528
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,280
as well

529
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,159
so

530
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,640
going on so now we've got our csev

531
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,200
format but it's it's i would rather say

532
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,280
it's just a start so so we need to get

533
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,159
better here and one of the big problems

534
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,480
that we have here now so uh taking the

535
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,200
next step on the maturity ladder

536
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,960
uh unique product identifiers so it's uh

537
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,559
the the the

538
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,559
the essential problem is usually

539
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,000
on the one side you've got your asset

540
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,520
list as

541
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,679
an operator of equipment on the other

542
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,840
side you've got those advisories and you

543
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,320
need to match those and uh what you need

544
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,640
to have here is uh yeah

545
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,400
some kind of product identifiers where

546
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,480
you can really match both entries from

547
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,760
from those two lists and uh this is not

548
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,600
easy to do

549
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,240
not easy to do at all and

550
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,919
we started working on that if you go

551
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,159
back to the previous slide you saw we

552
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,400
are using an order number actually to

553
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,960
give a unique identify at least for our

554
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,919
own devices but we know it's not enough

555
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,520
so

556
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,000
so we we created that and also the csaf

557
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,960
format created that to be extensible so

558
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,440
so we can use different unique product

559
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,159
identifiers for for yeah this matching

560
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,760
process and

561
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,360
a lot of discussion is already being

562
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,120
done in the security community inside

563
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,039
the product security community about

564
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,200
that problem so there are many many

565
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,840
standards available spd x we've got

566
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,320
s-bomb with cyclone dx and so on and so

567
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,240
forth and it's being discussed what's

568
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,559
the best way but in the end

569
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,799
our opinion here is yeah

570
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,280
we usually you do not agree on one

571
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,360
single standard so we will try to

572
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,520
support as many as needed actually and

573
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,919
so what we get there then is

574
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,480
input for automated asset management so

575
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,400
you can automatically match those two

576
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,480
lists asset lists and the vulnerability

577
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,720
lists that's good and then you can also

578
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,760
do on the consumer side so the typical

579
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,400
operators of of the environments they

580
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,240
can do that automated advisory

581
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,919
processing which is great actually

582
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,520
because they do not need to do that

583
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,200
manually anymore

584
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,280
and i'm emphasizing that because i'm not

585
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,440
talking about it site i'm talking about

586
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,840
industrial environments and we know that

587
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,880
a lot of customers of us typical

588
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,120
industrial operators have that problem

589
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,600
and this would be solved then

590
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,720
actually and in the end yeah we want to

591
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,120
have complete asset management process

592
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,200
on on the operator side

593
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,520
so identifying products i already told

594
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,360
you it's it's a

595
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,520
kind of a big problem so if you thought

596
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,000
that maybe a cpe the common platform

597
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,520
enumeration would have which has been

598
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,679
around i don't know for quite some time

599
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,080
10 years longer

600
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,559
it already tried to solve that problem

601
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,559
for us

602
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,559
but unfortunately

603
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,159
at least for us it's not a working

604
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,360
solution because so here it's very small

605
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
i just looked for a typical product of

606
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,559
us so that's the s7 1500 so a typical

607
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,120
controller for industrial environments

608
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,279
and if you look that up you can see a

609
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,440
lot of entries here here it's different

610
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,120
versions actually but it's also

611
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,200
different naming schemes on the one side

612
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,480
it's the order number that is being

613
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,960
displayed suddenly in here it on the

614
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,679
other side it's called simatic is 7 1500

615
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,000
and in some cases we've got simatic s7

616
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,880
1518 which is a special

617
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,919
model of the s7 1500 and um that's

618
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,840
it's not working so you've got really

619
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,520
duplicates inside cpe and this makes it

620
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,679
actually for us useless unfortunately

621
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:58,480
and

622
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,279
this is why we need to um we need to

623
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,120
solve the problem in a different way and

624
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,960
as already said currently we're using

625
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,799
order ids

626
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,919
from us but we can use any other

627
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,360
id as needed later on and the nice thing

628
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,000
is about those order ids if you ask our

629
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,559
devices with snmp they will tell you the

630
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,120
order id so automated matching becomes

631
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,520
possible here and this is actually of

632
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,879
our first step on the way here

633
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,679
now

634
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,799
a little um outlook also into the area

635
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,080
of um s-bomb so how how does all of that

636
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,840
work together so on the one side we've

637
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,159
got csaf with a lot of information about

638
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,960
the vulnerabilities a lot of details the

639
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,400
necessary details about single

640
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
vulnerabilities on the other side we've

641
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,240
got s-bond so the software bill of

642
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,000
materials that gives you a lot of

643
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,120
insight into the systems themselves so

644
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,880
for example if you have an embedded

645
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,360
controller the system it consists of one

646
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,520
or multiple applications on the inside

647
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,000
it will consist of one or multiple

648
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,320
libraries it will consist of maybe a

649
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,520
certain

650
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,520
modules in the background as well and

651
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,000
also and s bond gives you really insight

652
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,360
into all of that

653
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,279
that's good

654
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,760
but in the end it's a lot of data that

655
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,600
if available on the on the other side

656
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,640
we're coping about single

657
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,039
vulnerabilities and the nice aspect here

658
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,000
is that a new standard is being worked

659
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,279
on that's called

660
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,520
vex vulnerability exchange

661
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,600
and this is actually a very short

662
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,320
advisory containing not a lot of details

663
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
it's just about a

664
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,919
vendor statement so

665
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,080
m is a certain product affected or is it

666
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,080
not affected and this bridges the gap

667
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,520
actually between those two different

668
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,600
worlds on one side s bomb with a lot of

669
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,000
information about different components

670
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,919
where for example a certain let's say

671
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,640
open ssl vulnerability is indicated and

672
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,440
vex then enables the vendors to quickly

673
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,360
issue a statement are we affected in

674
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,520
certain products or not

675
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,720
and um for vex actually there's also a

676
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,840
csaf

677
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,840
profile available where we can just

678
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,520
publish that necessary information

679
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,919
inside csef so that we don't need to

680
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,120
jump on a different format

681
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,240
right

682
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,840
so that's about unique product

683
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,600
identifiers and s-bomb how will it go on

684
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,960
next step would be yeah really

685
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
not only uh

686
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,480
from time to time issuing the advisories

687
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,320
at the moment we've got our advisory day

688
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,640
each month

689
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,279
[Music]

690
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,520
we expect that to happen more often

691
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,279
especially with highly critical

692
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,840
vulnerabilities we also have out of band

693
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,720
publications and what we also need

694
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,240
actually in regards to the quality of

695
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,000
the advisory is

696
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,080
more machine readable information about

697
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,159
details of a certain vulnerability so

698
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,279
for example

699
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,440
what port is affected of the device

700
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,120
maybe what network interfaces are

701
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,960
affected for certain device if it has

702
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,120
multiple network interfaces

703
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,080
or also what configuration setting is

704
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,600
actually needed so that a certain

705
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,559
vulnerability is exploitable one example

706
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,880
the web server of one of our controllers

707
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,399
so if that one is affected you can

708
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,960
easily disable that web server

709
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,360
so so we would see that it would like to

710
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,799
see that information inside the

711
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,200
advisories as well and also in an

712
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,919
automatable way so processable way um so

713
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,320
that yeah it can be easily evaluated

714
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,080
because we see a lot of information

715
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,159
actually being pulled out of the vendors

716
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,320
so as tom was showing within the

717
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,919
statistics it's going to be a lot of

718
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,440
data that is uh

719
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,320
uh

720
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,159
that is going to be published also in

721
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,000
the years to come so we need at

722
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,159
automation for all of that and this

723
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,880
enables consumers to

724
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,360
more quickly decide am i affected or not

725
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,880
because they can decide yeah that's a

726
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,240
web that's the web server but it's

727
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,559
protected by my parameter so it's

728
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,200
usually no problem for me for example

729
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,279
and then you also see automated patching

730
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,919
so big issue in ot environments we do

731
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,640
not have central management it's usually

732
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,840
footwork for the admins to patch a plc

733
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,760
guess how often it happens

734
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,640
almost never that any embedded device in

735
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,159
industrial environments are actually

736
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,120
patched

737
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,000
and

738
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,520
in the end

739
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,679
it would be good to design the whole

740
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,080
system so that all the downtime of

741
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,640
signal systems are accepted and can be

742
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,919
mitigated

743
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,360
but that's going to be a challenge

744
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,880
especially for the eot environment where

745
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,039
we have long lifetimes a lot of

746
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,679
equipment in brown field that are old

747
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,159
that won't support new standards aspects

748
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,679
like that and we need to cope with all

749
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,440
of that

750
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,000
so that's yeah only partly applicable to

751
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
ot i was also writing here because of

752
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,240
automated patching at the moment we

753
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,640
don't see it but maybe in 15 years let's

754
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,520
see how it will develop

755
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,440
so thanks for your attention thanks for

756
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,000
the interest here

757
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,039
thank you very much for very interesting

758
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,279
talk uh i was vague about uh cesar of

759
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,000
vex and s-bomb now i have a clear

760
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,840
picture thank you so any questions

761
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,919
please use

762
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,039
standing mics there or there you can

763
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,080
have it

764
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,879
closer over there

765
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,039
hello hi i think for a very interesting

766
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,240
and in-depth uh

767
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,919
commitment

768
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,880
uh as a customer who has a lot of

769
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,159
various siemens implementations

770
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,080
uh it's we often regard it as more

771
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,080
more risky to actually perform a patch

772
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,760
in terms of

773
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,440
will it work if we have to downgrade

774
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,120
will that even work

775
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,320
what are the

776
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,320
experiences from other customers of

777
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,960
siemens that have performed the same

778
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,159
um

779
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,600
i might think that you would have a

780
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,440
protocol so that when you release a

781
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,720
patch

782
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,640
you have a method that customers can

783
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,159
report back to you whether or not it

784
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,200
worked with

785
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,200
certain types of integrations certain

786
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,880
certain types of installation

787
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,240
environments

788
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,320
so that you could warn other customers

789
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,519
that if you have this and this

790
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,120
environment

791
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,720
you might want to watch out for this and

792
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,000
this some some feedback loop

793
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,840
for that

794
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,399
so do we have the support of course

795
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,720
that's available to all the customers

796
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,519
but you're right uh that's something uh

797
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,720
that that

798
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,880
is needed actually so so i mean what

799
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,200
what you know within within uh yeah

800
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,320
typical

801
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,720
updates uh so so we get

802
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,399
incompatibilities uh you will not be 100

803
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,799
sure that it will work after an update

804
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,480
and we are working very hard actually to

805
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,039
ensure that but uh

806
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,519
that there will be always corner cases

807
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,080
so um

808
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,159
we really have to think about that so so

809
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,679
we also have to talk to the product

810
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,279
owners here but i think it's a good

811
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,880
suggestion actually that there's a

812
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,200
feedback loop also giving warning to

813
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,880
customers about yeah certain

814
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,799
incompatibilities inside the new

815
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,039
software yes that has to be automated by

816
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,399
siemens so that

817
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,200
because

818
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,279
if it's a critical vulnerability this

819
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,880
might have to happen within hours or

820
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,760
days

821
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,320
so if a customer detects something

822
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,000
if we detect something when we install a

823
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,880
patch

824
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,039
there should be one simple easy to know

825
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,039
channel to get that feedback back to

826
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,360
siemens and for that information perhaps

827
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,519
to flow to other customers as well

828
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,440
that's what what what you also do not

829
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
have right now is an automated way of

830
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,279
checking the compatibility because

831
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,120
usually you've got multiple components

832
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,679
inside your ot environment and all of

833
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,279
them have to work together and you also

834
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,840
need to have uh yeah the acceptance

835
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,799
actually of of of the vendor that all of

836
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,640
that works together and if you update

837
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,720
now one component will it still work is

838
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,039
it still actually approved by the vendor

839
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,039
in that specific environment that's also

840
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,840
not available and we know of that issue

841
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,679
actually but the feedback loop is a good

842
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:04,880
suggestion

843
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,880
this one i noted that

844
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,279
you had you can make future use of

845
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,519
identifiers in the json

846
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,720
so identifiers that

847
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,799
that tell you have you enabled this and

848
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,880
that feature or do you use this and that

849
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,080
plug-in

850
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,080
could also be used to narrow down

851
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,240
further exactly which systems are

852
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,399
susceptible to a vulnerability even if

853
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,480
the product is susceptible you might not

854
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,200
be

855
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,799
vulnerable if you have configured it in

856
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,799
a certain way right that's what i was

857
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,640
talking about the configurational

858
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,159
aspects actually that should also be

859
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,720
contained inside the csf advisory we

860
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,440
have that already but it's free text and

861
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,600
we need to standardize that so that you

862
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,480
can

863
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,320
so that you that it's machine readable

864
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,559
and you can automate asset management is

865
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,240
a challenge but that is an even bigger

866
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,159
challenge so we have this on the roadmap

867
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,519
we know this

868
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,880
and uh

869
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,200
but this is the first step as we showed

870
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,080
with those with those four layers of of

871
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,640
maturity this is the first step that you

872
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,039
have something automated

873
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,519
and it will become better i promise you

874
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,960
and about the about the feedback channel

875
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,918
currently productcert at siemens.com is

876
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,158
the

877
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,199
entity that gives out those advisories

878
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,719
and if you have problems with these

879
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,599
advisories i take it on me that you can

880
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,399
use the same channel to to get feedback

881
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,440
on those

882
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,359
advisories and on those patches so we

883
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,320
can give them forward them to the

884
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,199
team

885
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,280
and if we are overwhelmed with the

886
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,320
feedback we need to find a way of how to

887
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,679
automate it

888
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,839
thank you very much

889
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,239
one more question

890
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,960
uh

891
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,320
i've i worked on csf1 for a bit long ago

892
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,879
with uh stefan haagen uh

893
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:55,760
and

894
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,040
like

895
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,400
a common uh product enumeration

896
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,160
standard uh the cpe

897
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,040
uh

898
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,240
that standard needs a little bit of

899
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,320
brush up it seems like because we've had

900
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,240
a little trouble with it and sticks land

901
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,960
and i was wondering uh

902
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,839
is is cpu still part of csaf right now

903
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,839
it's it's not okay

904
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,079
that was a dumb question cpe is not part

905
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,040
of of of csu

906
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,280
and

907
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,119
it does not work for us

908
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,359
and but you are working on something

909
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,640
that that could work in a few years so

910
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,440
would that be a more generic next

911
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,599
version of cpe

912
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,599
or would it be really bespoke to the

913
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,200
needs of csaf

914
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,599
so so uh csef is really agnostic to the

915
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,000
product identifier so you can use cpe

916
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,480
you can use order ids as as we were

917
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,599
using in the advisors or are using so so

918
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,920
it's really agnostic so whatever comes

919
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,480
it will be usable within csf that's a

920
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,960
nice thing but we do not know yet what

921
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,720
will come so it's a discussion that is

922
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,079
ongoing and in the end i would expect

923
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:04,880
that

924
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,599
yeah it will never decide on one single

925
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,440
standard here so we need to support

926
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,760
multiple ones so that wasn't my question

927
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,200
my question was more

928
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,879
is there something better than cpe

929
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,200
not not anything

930
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,760
globally available yeah for us all the

931
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,520
ids are better but that's seaman

932
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,720
specific

933
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,760
sorry please okay okay i got one last

934
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,839
question my question is about you're

935
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,920
speeding up until

936
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,240
it hits the customer so

937
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,400
you pre you you're speeding up the

938
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,280
producer's side but then

939
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,599
[Music]

940
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,520
how do you envision the

941
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,720
customer of your product being faster in

942
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,880
patching or doing the countermeasures do

943
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,079
you have any

944
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,280
any vision on how that can be yeah

945
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,839
supported speed up whatever your your

946
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,599
goal is

947
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,160
so first first off uh the receiver is

948
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,560
not just the customer it's also it could

949
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,079
be certs

950
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,760
it could be uh

951
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,480
anyone who who

952
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,520
needs to

953
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,599
read our advisories

954
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,920
so it could be some some vulnerability

955
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,480
scanner company who makes tests for

956
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,280
those

957
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,000
uh

958
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,960
vulnerabilities also and uh we are also

959
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,119
we are not the only producer so it's an

960
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,720
open standard there are many other

961
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,079
companies who support it currently

962
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,920
for the people who receive it

963
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,200
they need to

964
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,920
improve their automation in

965
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,119
depends on on the specific use case a

966
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,520
cert has to do something different than

967
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,359
um than a oil company also and and asset

968
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,599
management for example to have a

969
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,960
database of what are my assets

970
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,760
uh is is a very good first step so you

971
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,160
have your assets you have the vulnerable

972
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,920
product and then you can do the matching

973
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,280
between those two

974
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,839
and this should be half automated or

975
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,040
full automated or or yeah you have to to

976
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,640
see how far you get

977
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,640
uh with the first step we want to

978
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,599
improve this in the in maturity level

979
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,880
three and four so okay but you in the in

980
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,160
the end you've got two

981
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,920
two solutions on the one side open

982
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,280
source would be great if you get

983
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,280
additional tools for the operators

984
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,440
second is commercial providers so

985
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,520
typical threat intelligence provider

986
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,040
providers of vulnerability scanners um

987
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,960
they will of course also use that

988
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,640
information so there are parcels and

989
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,200
visualizers and there's a lot of uh

990
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,079
stuff i think last week it came out and

991
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,920
this on the csf uh oasis page visible

992
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,839
one last follow-up question csuf is

993
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,720
targeted only at ot or also envisioned

994
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,119
for it everybody

995
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,000
thanks

996
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,640
sorry could you make it uh

997
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,760
offline offline okay okay so uh

998
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,480
so thank uh let us thank the speakers

999
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,079
again thank you thank you
