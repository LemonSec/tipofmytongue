with that

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,160
i'd like to introduce dr owen byrne he

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,480
has had extensive background in cluster

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,800
work he's a cluster manager at cyber

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,959
ireland the national cyber security

29
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,560
cluster organization

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,320
and he has led the establishment

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,119
management of the cluster since 2018.

32
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,439
uh owen brings together industry

33
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,520
academia and government and he's here to

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,880
do his presentation

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,199
take it

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,439
away don't think the clicker is working

37
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,560
so

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,960
we'll go without it thanks very much ted

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,320
um as you see my background isn't in

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,320
cyber security it's from a non-technical

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,479
area it's in economics so

42
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,560
be kind to me here today i'm going to

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,240
talk about some things you know that

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,000
aren't really the technical side of

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,439
cyber security but i think it's of

46
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,680
interest to the first community

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,320
and i think it's also really important

48
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,520
that first is here in ireland this week

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,640
because

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,240
not only

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,920
is it important for ireland because we

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,119
need to show

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,320
the importance of cyber security to

54
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,280
society to government to to industry but

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,960
ireland needs to start playing its role

56
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,119
as well in tackling cyber security

57
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,800
issues globally which which it is

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,920
already

59
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,879
and i think what first is going to do is

60
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,280
it's going to leave a lasting legacy in

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,520
in ireland and because all of you are

62
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,599
here you know through the presentations

63
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,000
the ideas uh the connections that are

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,160
made here and i'd just like to

65
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
congratulate the the organizers in the

66
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,080
local organizing committee in particular

67
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,519
brian honen

68
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,000
and emer o'neil as well for for bringing

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,040
it here

70
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,920
and so i'm going to be talking about

71
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,560
ireland's cyber security sector

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
and how it's grown over the last number

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,959
of years and the opportunity for growth

74
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:45,920
as well

75
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,000
and why this is really important for our

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,239
national cyber resilience so i'm going

77
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,239
to kind of start at the end and then i'm

78
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,400
going to work back to some of the

79
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,080
challenges that we're facing in ireland

80
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,560
around the cyber security sector

81
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,920
and its growth

82
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,560
and national cyber security challenges

83
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,080
and how many of these challenges really

84
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,760
aren't just technical security

85
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,040
challenges many of them are

86
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,879
non-technical challenges

87
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,519
and that are very complex

88
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,879
and no one organization um no one

89
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,879
government body no one country is really

90
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,159
going to be able to solve these

91
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,319
challenges these complex fact challenges

92
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,000
that we're facing today

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,560
and tomorrow into the future and how

94
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,200
collaboration is is one of the only ways

95
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,280
forward and how we've used this model of

96
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,760
collaboration and setting up a national

97
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,400
cyber security cluster or an industry

98
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,319
representative body

99
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,560
um and i think i'm already preaching to

100
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,720
the converted because this is what first

101
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,879
is it's a it's a community of people

102
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,920
from across industry academia government

103
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,640
and society and working to tackle the

104
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,360
security issues that we face globally

105
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,480
and then i'm just going to finish up

106
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,920
with okay well

107
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,159
how are we actually doing this

108
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,840
collaboration piece because it's great

109
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,000
to talk about it but what it is

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,519
difficult to do

111
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,360
and what have we achieved to date and

112
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,720
what have we learned from it as well

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,799
so just going back to

114
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,040
2018 when we were starting out looking

115
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,560
at the cyber security industry in

116
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,519
ireland

117
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,560
and ireland is known as being a tech hub

118
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,639
for europe we have many of the top

119
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,400
multinational companies that are based

120
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,759
here

121
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,840
most of them us-owned

122
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,759
across technology

123
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,680
and internet and many of them would be

124
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,720
based in dublin and out of this we saw

125
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,880
kind of an emerging cyber security

126
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,120
industry building up um with u.s

127
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,600
multinational companies five of the top

128
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,120
ten software security companies were

129
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,160
located here in 2018 we saw the

130
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,040
emergence of a domestic cyber security

131
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,520
industry and that were so that were

132
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,680
solving challenges or the industry need

133
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,080
of both irish smes but also some large

134
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,919
companies and government agencies as

135
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:56,720
well

136
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,880
and at the time there was about we

137
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
estimated about 6 000 people employed in

138
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,160
the sector

139
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,600
but one of the strong things that we

140
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,000
have in ireland is our education system

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
and we knew that we have a high number

142
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,520
of graduates coming out of that

143
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,000
education system from a stem background

144
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,520
so that was something that we we knew we

145
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,880
could build on

146
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,880
ireland is a neutral country or a

147
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,800
non-aligned country and i suppose that

148
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,960
would work to our advantage now

149
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,199
and then i suppose what we've done in

150
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,479
the meantime

151
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,039
is just last month we launched this

152
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,280
report which for the first time we now

153
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,880
have an understanding

154
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,360
of the size and scale of the cyber

155
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,240
security industry in ireland and we're

156
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,080
able to understand the companies that

157
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,560
are here their operations

158
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,880
the opportunities for growth and to

159
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,039
benchmark it against other countries

160
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,840
internationally and so with this data we

161
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,240
were able to develop a position paper

162
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
looking forward to the opportunity to

163
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,120
2030 to grow the cyber security industry

164
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,880
in ireland and that's really critical

165
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,560
because with a strong cyber security

166
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,120
industry of both multinational companies

167
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,840
and indigenous irish companies that also

168
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,759
helps our national cyber resilience as

169
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,400
well

170
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,840
so i'm just going to go through some of

171
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,039
the the findings from this report

172
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,240
and we now know that there's nearly

173
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,919
seven and a half thousand people

174
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,160
employed in the cyber security industry

175
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,840
in ireland these people are employed in

176
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,720
489 firms nearly 500 160 of them are

177
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,199
pure play cyber security companies and

178
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,360
there's another 330 companies then that

179
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,680
we would classify as diversified so

180
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,759
cyber security may make up an important

181
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,400
part of their products or their services

182
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,319
or what we've also seen a large growth

183
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,639
in is the number of diversified

184
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,199
companies across many different sectors

185
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,039
multinational companies who have their

186
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,600
socks or product security teams um here

187
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,919
in ireland as well and these companies

188
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,160
that we've estimated for the cyber

189
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,520
security companies it's a hundred

190
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,919
percent of revenue for the diversified

191
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,360
companies it's taking kind of an average

192
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,000
maybe around 25 percent of revenue and

193
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,960
that their revenue annually is 2 billion

194
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,880
and they're contributing 1.1 billion to

195
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,960
the irish economy so that's really

196
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,479
important information to be able to go

197
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,240
to government and show the importance of

198
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,680
the sector

199
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,560
and the companies that they're

200
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,840
contributing

201
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,120
we were able to map what are the

202
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,960
products in the service offered by these

203
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,639
various different companies so you can

204
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,280
see here a large number around managed

205
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,680
security service provision and securing

206
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,120
application networks and cloud

207
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,919
environments risk compliance and fraud

208
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,160
and tread intel and then we're seeing

209
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
quite a lot of growth in the the ot

210
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,720
security space and connected devices and

211
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,120
then that other category is anything

212
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,960
from internal r d

213
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,599
and to recruitment and surveillance in a

214
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,280
couple of other areas that we we put in

215
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
there together

216
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,360
we were able to do a nice heat map of

217
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,280
where are all the companies in the cyber

218
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,199
security sector in ireland

219
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,800
and

220
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,560
from those 500 companies there's about

221
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,759
730 offices that we mapped you can see

222
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,960
dublin obviously is a is a hub of the

223
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,639
cyber security industry in ireland

224
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,879
because of the number of companies that

225
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,680
that are here and and the customers but

226
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,520
interestingly enough you can see these

227
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,919
clusters all across the country and a

228
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,599
lot of them are actually located close

229
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,720
to i suppose major cities urban areas

230
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,960
but also linked into the universities

231
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,800
and the third level institute so you can

232
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,520
see a list of the third level institutes

233
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,919
the research centers who are providing

234
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,240
graduates and talent into the sector

235
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,560
around the country here so we're seeing

236
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
strong cyber security clusters not only

237
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,360
in dublin but in cork galway in the west

238
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,440
coast limerick

239
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,719
and some of you might even see these

240
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,000
places if you're staying on for the

241
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,279
weekend

242
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,880
and we also looked at then not only the

243
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,958
number of offices but the employment per

244
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,800
capita in these regions

245
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,600
to really understand what is the the

246
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,920
focus of cyber security employment

247
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,760
across the country and while dublin

248
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,279
really does stand out with a number of

249
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,600
companies we see that on a per capita

250
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,640
basis

251
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,240
cork is um the the hub of cyber security

252
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,560
activity and i like to point this out

253
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,160
because i'm from cork

254
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,399
and any second city you know likes to

255
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,920
point out how we have one over on the

256
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,440
capital city

257
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,120
and that's where cyber ireland is based

258
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,600
so we're hosted in a university monster

259
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,519
technological university in cork and

260
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,440
there's really a hub of u.s

261
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,839
multinational cyber security activity in

262
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,279
cork as well

263
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,200
as galway limerick and we've even

264
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
compared it to belfast which is a strong

265
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,000
cyber security sector um up in northern

266
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,360
ireland

267
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,959
and these are just a selection of some

268
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,959
of the cyber security companies and

269
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,959
operations that we have in ireland so

270
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,040
you can see that with a number of pure

271
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,120
play cyber security companies the the

272
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,600
clustering cork built up around two key

273
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,000
ones trend micro and mcafee in the

274
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,440
naughties who moved their emea

275
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,839
headquarters to ireland and they started

276
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,600
off with you know tech support roles

277
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,040
shared services

278
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,519
operations finance inside sales would

279
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,279
have built on those tech support roles

280
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,360
and moved up the line to

281
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,600
engineering jobs um r d sock tret intel

282
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
teams as well and so i suppose this is

283
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,040
kind of one of our key goals of the

284
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,720
cluster is to develop these

285
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,440
multinational operations and higher up

286
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
the value chain to deliver highly

287
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,839
skilled jobs but outside of the the

288
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,320
cyber security companies you can see a

289
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,040
wide range of diversified companies that

290
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,120
have their security operation centers

291
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,959
like hp have their european cyber

292
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,680
defense center in galway to dell and

293
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,519
vmware who have product security teams

294
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,240
based here in ireland and it's off of

295
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,600
you know the seven and a half thousand

296
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,440
people that are employed here

297
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
seven out of ten of those jobs are

298
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,279
actually in us multinationals showing

299
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,519
the importance of that fdi to the

300
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,320
development of the the sector here

301
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,000
so it's off the back of these companies

302
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,600
that we're seeing the development of the

303
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,440
domestic cyber security industry in

304
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,200
ireland and we've mapped out that

305
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,600
there's 60 irish companies that are

306
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,079
already exporting internationally

307
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,760
um you can see there across various

308
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,320
different areas from mssps to

309
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
identity access management application

310
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,480
data protection it infrastructure and

311
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,640
hardware grc

312
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,079
and what's really exciting is now we're

313
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,880
seeing a number of startups emerging off

314
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,800
the back of some people working in these

315
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,880
multinational companies some people

316
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,399
servicing the needs of these

317
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,720
multinational companies

318
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,839
that are starting up their own

319
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,920
cybersecurity companies as well

320
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,000
and with this data we were able to look

321
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,399
out to the future and say you know on

322
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,440
the current growth rate of of 10

323
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
and where we are today

324
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,800
what's the cyber security sector going

325
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,519
to look like in 2030. we surveyed our

326
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,600
members and 83 percent of them expected

327
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,760
their cybersecurity teams to grow over

328
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,160
the next 12 months 50 of those companies

329
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,040
said that they're going to grow at a

330
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,440
rate of 25 or higher and so we're

331
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,040
predicting that

332
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,480
from seven and a half thousand jobs

333
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,519
today we can move to 17 000 jobs by 2030

334
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,839
with an economic contribution to the

335
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,160
economy of 2.5 billion which is really

336
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,600
really significant

337
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,519
but if we're going to do that there's a

338
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,120
number of challenges that we're already

339
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,600
facing today that need to be addressed

340
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,040
and the only way we can address these

341
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,120
challenges is through

342
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,040
a collaborative approach and just to

343
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,320
highlight some of them that we've

344
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,399
identified through this report

345
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,079
and you're probably all seeing this in

346
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,839
your organizations and across the world

347
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,240
is skills shortages and it was actually

348
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,000
the reason why cyber ireland was set up

349
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
in the first place but from our survey

350
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,639
last year 60 of the firms had staff

351
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,079
related issues around suitable

352
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,959
candidates skills shortages skilled gaps

353
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,000
and salaries retentions and

354
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,720
it's no surprise that irish smes and

355
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,920
government agencies are really

356
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,600
struggling with this over multinational

357
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,120
companies

358
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,880
secondly we saw investment was a core

359
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,440
problem for companies as well 26 percent

360
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,279
of them found issues with raising or

361
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,440
securing finance which was impacting

362
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,279
their ability to be able to expand

363
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,639
globally to scale rapidly and also serve

364
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,480
larger clients as well

365
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,320
and then thirdly looking at the domestic

366
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,720
sector we see a lot of irish cyber

367
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,040
security companies who are less than 10

368
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,200
people within their operations

369
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
and if we want to grow the sector

370
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,720
significantly

371
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,480
for indigenous companies we need to be

372
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,079
able to scale the size of those

373
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,480
companies so that they can

374
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,639
address the needs of larger companies

375
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,399
and deliver high value cyber security

376
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,800
services and products to them and then

377
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,480
finally research and development if we

378
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,880
do want to become a leader for cyber

379
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,279
security and contribute to that globally

380
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,000
we need to address the fragmented r d

381
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,160
landscape where we've seen a low level

382
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,279
of collaborative research and

383
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,040
development between industry and

384
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,760
academia a lot of the r d projects are

385
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,240
mainly small scale at the moment

386
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,399
and this needs to be addressed urgently

387
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,240
so you can see here that the challenges

388
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,680
that i'm pointing out are not of a

389
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,240
technical nature but of a non-technical

390
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,959
nature and and relate to you know skills

391
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,760
the economy the political system and

392
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,839
working with government and society in

393
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,760
general and then bringing it back up to

394
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,120
some of the wider challenges we're

395
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,880
seeing in ireland there was a report

396
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,639
from grant thornton last year that was a

397
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,040
follow-up to a previous report in 2017

398
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,279
that found the economic costs of cyber

399
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,519
crime in ireland was around 10 billion

400
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,760
and there was a 50 increase in online

401
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,639
fraud 45 increase in phishing complaints

402
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,399
and a survey of business leaders said

403
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,399
you know yeah cyber security is really

404
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,639
important for 95 percent of them but

405
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,480
only half have a formal cyber security

406
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,480
strategy and only half have a cyber

407
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,639
awareness training and campaign for

408
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,959
employees as well

409
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,000
and if we're looking at this in the

410
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,480
context of ireland's digital economy

411
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,240
which is really really important and

412
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,959
significant to our society you know

413
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,440
digitally intensive companies employ

414
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,399
210 000 people in ireland and account

415
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,320
for 13 of our gdp 26 of exports you saw

416
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,760
that with some of the leading

417
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,360
multinational companies in their emea

418
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,120
headquarters based here

419
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,839
dublin has become a data center hub for

420
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,839
europe uh with the location of a number

421
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,519
of data centers

422
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,040
and if you look at our digital readiness

423
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,959
we score quite well on international

424
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,680
comparison you know we rank 30 globally

425
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,959
whether if you look at our cyber

426
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,880
security preparedness we're not ranking

427
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,600
at high um 73rd globally so there's a

428
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,839
mismatch there between our our digital

429
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,839
readiness and development and our cyber

430
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,320
security preparedness and from a pwc

431
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,199
report it found that cyber crime attacks

432
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,800
in irish organizations were double the

433
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,519
global average the cost of those cr

434
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,760
attacks were higher and than the global

435
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,519
average and 69 of companies spend the

436
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,600
same or more on cleanup and that was 50

437
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,000
percent higher than the global

438
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,839
global average so

439
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,079
cyber crime is a threat to to irish

440
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,639
companies to government agencies which

441
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,839
we have seen last year with the

442
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,560
ransomware attack on our health service

443
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,959
which crippled hospitals across the

444
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,160
country

445
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,839
and also cyber crime is a threat to

446
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,600
ireland's international reputation as

447
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,320
being a location for digital enterprise

448
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,279
as well and again this sits in an

449
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,360
international context of non-technical

450
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,880
challenges as well where we're seeing an

451
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,959
increase in cyber crime globally we're

452
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,560
seeing the impact of digital

453
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,279
transformation and covet 19 and people

454
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,440
moving to remote working

455
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,399
manufacturing companies moving to

456
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,000
digitalization

457
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,040
and to the geopolitical crisis and the

458
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,680
cyber implications of the war in ukraine

459
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,199
and the skills shortages that are

460
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,079
impacting companies globally and these

461
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,720
challenges again are non-technical in

462
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,639
nature um

463
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,480
but they are really really complex and

464
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,800
and no one organization no one company

465
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,560
no one government agency is going to

466
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,720
solve these complex challenges by

467
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,440
themselves and so we need conferences

468
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,279
like this we need organizations and

469
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,600
communities to be able to bring people

470
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,440
together to work on these complex

471
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,920
challenges across you know geographical

472
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,000
boundaries cultural boundaries political

473
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,800
boundaries whatever they may be and this

474
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,160
is what we're trying to do through this

475
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,959
clustering model which i suppose is

476
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,639
looking to really grow the clustering

477
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,079
model has been used to grow growth

478
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,399
sectors internationally for for a number

479
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,839
of years

480
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,440
and it brings this kind of

481
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,359
multidisciplinary stakeholder approach

482
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,839
whereby industry is working together you

483
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,119
have startups smes multinationals across

484
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,720
a supply chain or

485
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,799
a value chain but you also have all the

486
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,559
other key stakeholders from public

487
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,520
bodies to the universities providing the

488
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
the graduates the talent the research

489
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,799
and innovation

490
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,280
to finance in vcs that are funding the

491
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,520
development of companies to media who

492
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
are communicating

493
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,200
about that sector or those challenges

494
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,440
and all of the other organizations for

495
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,799
collaboration whether they be tech

496
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,039
meet-ups or more formal trade

497
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,200
associations

498
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,480
and so when we were starting out with

499
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,720
cyber ireland in 2018

500
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,080
we needed something to bring the

501
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,600
industry together although we had a lot

502
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,000
of cyber security companies here

503
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,760
they weren't necessarily talking to each

504
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,799
other

505
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,360
and so what we identified as a key

506
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,880
challenge to bring these companies

507
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,960
together was around skills

508
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,039
and there was about 30 or so companies

509
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,280
in cork that were all finding skills

510
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,600
challenges and

511
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,799
difficult for their companies to be able

512
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,320
to grow and serve clients

513
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,600
internationally

514
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,919
and so the university in cork brought

515
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,799
them in and to get them to talk to share

516
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,320
their experiences and to see what we

517
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,080
could do and while the immediate

518
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,520
challenge was around getting people with

519
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,240
technical expertise five years plus

520
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,160
experience they realized that they would

521
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,400
need to work with the education sector

522
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,080
to develop a pipeline of graduates

523
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,240
coming out with cyber security skills

524
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,840
that wasn't being done possibly at the

525
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,480
time and that if a number of companies

526
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,960
could show this is our need for the next

527
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,799
you know five years in regards to cyber

528
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,200
security talent and roles that the

529
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,720
education institutes could then change

530
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,320
their courses to be able to fill these

531
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,880
gaps and so that's what started out the

532
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,480
development of a cluster because at the

533
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,760
time there was no industry

534
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,880
representative body for the

535
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,440
cybersecurity industry in ireland

536
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,720
at the time there was a number of

537
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,039
security meet-ups around the country but

538
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,200
there was nobody coordinating what was

539
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,400
happening

540
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,000
at the time it was one-to-one

541
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,600
engagements between industry and

542
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,840
academia working on courses

543
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
and at the time there was nobody

544
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,880
collecting all of the shared challenges

545
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,799
and and needs of the cyber security

546
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,960
industry to engage with government

547
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,000
and so

548
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,360
we looked at the cyber security

549
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,440
challenges around skills at the time in

550
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,559
ireland

551
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,039
we mapped out the the sector from the

552
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,320
companies that were providing the

553
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,400
products and services to the integrators

554
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,559
the distributors to the end users and

555
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,160
the consumers to who are the

556
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,080
universities and the research institutes

557
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,840
and the government agencies

558
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,440
we went around the country we ran

559
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,840
workshops in cork always in dublin we

560
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,440
had hundreds of cyber security

561
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,960
professionals show up there was only

562
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,320
standing room

563
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,480
at the back of some of the venues

564
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,400
and people were there openly discussing

565
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,080
what were the challenges for their for

566
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,160
their companies and for their industries

567
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,240
and we built real buy-in from from the

568
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
people there to understand what their

569
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,000
needs and of course we couldn't do

570
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,440
everything we couldn't boil the ocean so

571
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,600
it was really important to focus down on

572
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,880
specific needs that we could address

573
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,799
and it was important that we had buy-in

574
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,880
from across these key stakeholders and

575
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,720
so we put together an advisory board

576
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,960
made up of key leaders from industry

577
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
both pure place cyber security companies

578
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,400
and diversified companies both

579
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,640
multinationals and indigenous irish

580
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,480
companies we had representatives from

581
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
academia representatives from

582
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,559
government as well as the the national

583
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,799
cyber security center

584
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,039
and so we set out a strategy to

585
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,880
represent the cyber security industry in

586
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,880
ireland to provide that collective voice

587
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,320
for industry

588
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,880
and having a goal to enhance innovation

589
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,480
and growth and competitiveness of these

590
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,559
companies and to put ireland on the map

591
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,880
as being a cyber security leader in

592
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,000
europe

593
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,240
we have a number of supporters so we're

594
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,760
based in monster technological

595
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,000
university in cork we're funded by a

596
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,840
government agency supporting irish

597
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,000
companies and foreign direct investment

598
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,679
as well as the national cyber security

599
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:52,799
center

600
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,640
and some of the actual initiatives that

601
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,960
we have done to date fall under these

602
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,640
four broad headings and i'm going to

603
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,720
just discuss them briefly to show

604
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,039
how we're doing that collaborative piece

605
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,240
of work from really a grassroots um

606
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,480
organization because it's just myself

607
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,919
and a marketing manager who are running

608
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,080
it but it's the the time and dedication

609
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,720
from the board and the various different

610
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,960
members that are driving this to date so

611
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,120
we have that foundation level of

612
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,280
building the community bringing people

613
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,159
together to share information share

614
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,720
expertise what they've done and so that

615
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,480
when you meet somebody and you've built

616
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,000
up that relationship and that trust you

617
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,200
can start looking at some of the

618
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,440
challenges and the second part is how

619
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,679
can we grow a homegrown

620
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:39,280
cybersecurity pipeline of talent in

621
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,280
ireland working with industry and

622
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,600
academia the third one is looking at

623
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,200
collaborative research and development

624
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,440
between industry and academia and the

625
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,760
fourth one then is supporting both smes

626
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,120
and multinationals to be able to grow

627
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,600
and export globally from ireland

628
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,880
and how we're doing that is through a

629
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,640
number of events and meetups we have

630
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,880
regional chapters around the country we

631
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,200
have special interest groups and we

632
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
collect information on advocacy to

633
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,200
relate that to government agencies we

634
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,280
have a tread intelligence series and

635
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,000
that we ran last year taking people from

636
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
you know the introductory introduction

637
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,240
to trend intelligence to more advanced

638
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,159
topics

639
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,080
um we have a talented skills working

640
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,000
group we don't provide any education and

641
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,919
training but we need to understand the

642
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,600
needs of industry and relay that to the

643
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,679
education and training providers so that

644
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,200
they can align their courses with the

645
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
needs of industry and then there's a key

646
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,720
piece here in looking down the line on

647
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,559
how we're going to attract the next

648
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,000
generation of cyber security

649
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,840
professionals into the industry so

650
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,600
working with young people and students

651
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,520
from around the country

652
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,440
and also career changes in adults you

653
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,080
know why you should look at maybe coming

654
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,559
into the career in cyber security why

655
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,240
why it's of interest why it's a valuable

656
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,640
career um besides the salaries that are

657
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,240
available at the moment

658
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,000
and so we launched a cyber security

659
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,880
skills report in 2021 which outlined the

660
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
cybersecurity skills shortages in

661
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,120
industry and the skill gaps and from

662
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,360
this we were able to talk to a number of

663
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,600
universities to say look these are the

664
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,520
skills shortages that are that we've

665
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,080
been able to find this is the the gaps

666
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,679
that need to be filled

667
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,919
how can you address those and the main

668
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,600
challenge for industry is p people don't

669
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,280
want to go back and spend two or three

670
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,520
years doing a masters and while they're

671
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,600
already working in industry it takes a

672
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,760
lot of time and effort and so we worked

673
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,320
with four of the leading universities to

674
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,480
take modules from across all of the

675
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,799
different universities and to be able to

676
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,679
create course pathways for specific

677
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,400
skills shortages within companies and so

678
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,799
we have a number of people from across

679
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,360
industry now on these courses which can

680
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,520
all be done online picking modules from

681
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,520
across the universities and developing

682
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,039
out a number of

683
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,720
course pathways

684
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,880
around stock analysts pen testers for

685
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,279
financial services looking at ot

686
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,400
security and manufacturing um i.t

687
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,480
managers in smes

688
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,080
this the funding for this came from

689
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,760
government there was eight million euros

690
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,880
in funding which probably should have

691
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,320
been given us to just getting the

692
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,000
academic institutes to work together

693
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,559
alone never mind delivering and the

694
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,480
program as well

695
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,159
but we've also looked at supporting

696
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,080
women in cyber security and we have a

697
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,400
fantastic group cyber women ireland

698
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,039
which is supporting the development of

699
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,200
and and supportive women working in the

700
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,440
industry and they launched a report last

701
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,039
year around some of the challenges

702
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,000
around diversity and uh gender gaps in

703
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,760
cyber security and this is this is

704
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,880
really important not just from a

705
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,039
political perspective because it's the

706
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,640
right thing to do but if we're looking

707
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,559
at solving skills challenges and we're

708
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,480
leaving out 50 percent of the potential

709
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,640
workforce you know that that just

710
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,120
doesn't make sense it's crazy

711
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,960
looking at how can we attract young

712
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,600
people into a career in cyber security

713
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,960
and we applied for funding from the

714
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,360
government for this cyber security

715
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,440
summer camp working with secondary

716
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,480
schools and so this was just run in in

717
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,720
june a couple of weeks ago where we had

718
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,960
over 100 kids participating on a cyber

719
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,960
summer camp it was online and then they

720
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,640
go into the universities across those

721
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,440
four universities in the country and to

722
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,520
learn about cyber security ethical

723
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,520
hacking there's a capture the flag

724
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,720
competition

725
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,159
and we have industry speakers coming

726
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,440
into them and telling them about their

727
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,039
careers and how they got into cyber

728
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,520
security as well

729
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,120
we've looked at the research landscape

730
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,640
in ireland and mapped out who are the

731
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,559
key research centers

732
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,880
and the areas that they're working in

733
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
and we're looking to match make those

734
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,279
research centers with the people working

735
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,640
in research in industry as well

736
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,159
our key goal really here is to have a

737
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,320
national cyber security research center

738
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,080
in ireland that's bringing together

739
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,600
industry and academia working on

740
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,679
fundamental research but also then

741
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,840
looking at applied research as well as a

742
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,520
center for gravity

743
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,120
and then finally around that grow and

744
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,200
export piece it's looking at making

745
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,799
connections internationally with other

746
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,840
clusters

747
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,400
supporting irish companies to go global

748
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,880
and also attracting fdi into the country

749
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,880
so even just this week we had a cyber

750
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,120
investors days event where we invited

751
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,760
over investors from europe and cyber

752
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,360
security companies from across europe

753
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,200
with six irish companies pitching to

754
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,360
them and six european companies pitching

755
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,880
for investment

756
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,240
and a number of them walked away with

757
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,480
significant investment out of that

758
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,440
and then finally we had a response to

759
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,760
the through the pandemic here where the

760
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,279
cyber security community wanted to do

761
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,279
something to support the national effort

762
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,799
and so we worked with the national cyber

763
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,919
security center um in developing a panel

764
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,600
of subject matter experts that would be

765
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,039
able to respond

766
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,080
in a serious cyber security incident to

767
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,760
help the healthcare sector

768
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,840
and unfortunately this happened in may

769
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,840
last year and and these industry

770
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,760
representatives volunteers were able to

771
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,039
stand up

772
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,200
and contribute in a limited way at the

773
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,640
time

774
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,440
and so to conclude um you know national

775
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,000
chaos are a really um

776
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,880
fitting title for for this conference

777
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,120
and and for this presentation because

778
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,799
cyber security isn't just a technical

779
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,279
challenge but a political economic and

780
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,840
societal challenge that we need to work

781
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,080
together on if we're going to solve

782
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,640
and what we have found works is that it

783
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,039
is industry-led you have the support of

784
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,880
academia you have the support of

785
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,960
government but it needs to be for

786
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,799
society at the end of the day we need to

787
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,960
understand who are we doing this for

788
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
um and that we need to think long term

789
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,760
not just about company profits revenues

790
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,279
job creation

791
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,360
um but how are we actually solving the

792
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,279
challenges for cyber security into the

793
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,480
future

794
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,399
and the role of passionate and dedicated

795
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,480
leaders and people like you here in the

796
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,240
room today that are willing to go above

797
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,279
and beyond

798
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,000
their everyday work and business to

799
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,679
contribute back to

800
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,320
the community and to society and moving

801
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,559
from cooperation to collaboration

802
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,640
and what that means is we're quite good

803
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,039
at working with each other and somebody

804
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,679
asks you to help out on a project or for

805
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,640
a favor but how can we move to a shared

806
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,520
vision where we're working on a project

807
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,720
together

808
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,720
which could be on supporting national

809
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,799
cyber resilience for the country

810
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,240
and so that's everything for me thanks

811
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,410
very much

812
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:14,799
[Applause]

813
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,480
thanks very much if anyone has any

814
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,840
questions you said we have microphones

815
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,879
at the front and in the back

816
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,000
hello

817
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,640
uh thank you for your presentation and

818
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,919
i think that

819
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,080
the education is a very important things

820
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,399
oh sorry my name is kenta nakama from

821
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,960
for nic corporation from japan thank you

822
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,200
for your presentation and i have one

823
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,360
question about the education so the

824
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,200
education is very important things for

825
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,520
cyber security so you said

826
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,360
that there's some risk ring and they're

827
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,760
making a new job is

828
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,120
uh

829
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,919
the

830
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,200
maybe the education is very very

831
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,760
important things so i i'd like to know

832
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,640
the how is the education for children i

833
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,840
mean

834
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,840
from elementary school

835
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,159
and junior high school is there any

836
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,240
education for about cyber security

837
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,520
because i know the united kingdom has

838
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,120
education for children i think

839
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,279
yeah that's my question

840
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,760
yeah thanks very much um

841
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,159
the uk are our leaders in in this space

842
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,240
you know um with regards to cyber

843
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,399
security awareness for for society and

844
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,080
in particular for for young people as

845
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,880
well

846
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,559
um they have a fantastic program called

847
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,960
i think it's the uk cyber first yes um

848
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,200
which is basically what we copied and

849
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,080
we're not

850
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,520
we don't want to reinvent the wheel here

851
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,039
we're just looking at international best

852
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,799
practices and seeing what can we do here

853
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,120
in ireland and so in ireland there isn't

854
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,760
a cyber security awareness program in

855
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,919
primary or high school level as far as

856
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,279
i'm aware but there has been some

857
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,760
significant developments over the last

858
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,240
maybe 12 months so we had this cyber

859
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,320
first or cyber um cyber academy program

860
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,120
and then also there's been um a short

861
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,520
course that's been developed for 16 year

862
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,760
olds in in high school which has been

863
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,799
delivered by a university and also the

864
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,200
ncsc and it's hopefully it was running a

865
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,880
pilot base isn't going to be rolled out

866
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,720
next year and then there's a number of

867
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,039
not-for-profit organizations looking at

868
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,279
cyber awareness for

869
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,279
primary level schools

870
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,880
but not just the children i suppose the

871
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,200
important part is um communicating that

872
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,840
to to parents and teachers as well and

873
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,080
that's the key part we need to upskill

874
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,120
and train the teachers to be aware of of

875
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,960
cyber security and how they can convey

876
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,840
that to

877
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,159
their students as well okay thank you

878
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,320
very much

879
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880
thank you for the presentation i was

880
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,080
wondering what methodology did you use

881
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,640
to assess which companies were working

882
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,600
in cyber security and how much people

883
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,159
you had in the sector in ireland

884
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,600
my side remark on that would be that

885
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,480
uh

886
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,120
maybe it was it easier for you because

887
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,760
you're a smaller country and might

888
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,120
be some issues doing the same assessment

889
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,679
with larger country whereas a sector may

890
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,039
be more

891
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,880
with more companies and more people

892
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,159
working on it

893
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,039
yeah

894
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,640
a lot of things are easier in ireland

895
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,480
because we're a smaller company or such

896
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,720
a very small country and and relatively

897
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,799
well connected but the methodology we

898
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,799
use so we actually hired a consultancy

899
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,559
company that had done a similar report

900
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,799
in the uk on an annual basis on the size

901
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,799
of cyber security sector there and so

902
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,320
they were able to take that methodology

903
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,039
and apply to ireland and so we defined

904
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,200
out a taxonomy of

905
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,320
cyber security and products and services

906
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,240
and operations that we were going to

907
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,279
identify companies towards and we went

908
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,159
through lists of companies that we had

909
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,320
and google searched other companies to

910
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
be able to identify which ones were

911
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,320
delivering those cyber security products

912
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
or services and to put them into that

913
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,480
pure play category and then we went

914
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
outside of that and looked for any

915
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,159
companies that had those keywords

916
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,799
through um online searches that maybe

917
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,240
were part of their

918
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,080
their products or services a smaller

919
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,760
part of their products and services that

920
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,519
they were providing or companies that

921
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,600
were in the diversified that had

922
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,600
socks or product security teams here as

923
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,440
well and so we were able to put them

924
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,919
into that diversified category as well

925
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,039
and so then we went and had estimates of

926
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,720
the employment in each of those

927
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,880
companies by sending out a survey to

928
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,200
them so there was about

929
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,200
490 companies identified sent out

930
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,880
surveys to all of them and got service

931
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,640
actually back from about 100 companies

932
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,640
so it was a really nice sample there to

933
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,159
understand what was the employment in

934
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,159
them and we went through linkedin and

935
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,600
did scraping of the data there to

936
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,519
understand the employment within the

937
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,120
other organizations that we weren't able

938
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,679
to find and we were able to i suppose

939
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,799
scale data and extrapolate that data out

940
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,200
as well using the uk data where they had

941
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,519
a larger survey

942
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,480
thank you

943
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,240
we've only got about a minute left so if

944
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,399
you can keep your questions quick and we

945
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,240
can see if we can get through

946
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,159
thanks very much jane lochen from cert

947
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,600
new zealand thank you for a fantastic

948
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,600
talk really interesting just curious

949
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,039
just in terms of selling this into

950
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,720
politicians i imagine you had to do a

951
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,720
bit of a sell job to get the funding

952
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,399
what was the thing that excited them was

953
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,960
it the future promise of great tax

954
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,320
returns or

955
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,200
or tax revenue or something else

956
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,279
yeah it's important depending on what

957
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,720
government department you're talking to

958
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,320
so we got initial funding from the

959
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,480
government agency that supports foreign

960
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,039
direct investment and for them it was

961
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,720
the opportunity to grow the cyber

962
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,880
security fdi in ireland and so we were

963
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,799
pushing an open door for them where we

964
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,120
were able to put up the list of logos

965
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,039
here of the cyber security companies and

966
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,120
the operations that were here and also

967
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,559
the the opportunity for growth

968
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,840
internationally

969
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,760
likewise when we went to the enterprise

970
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,440
ireland the government agency supporting

971
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,279
smes it was a different picture that we

972
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,399
had to sell to them around the

973
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,720
opportunity for growth for for irish

974
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
companies and similarly when we talk to

975
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,159
department of communications it's

976
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,080
looking at national cyber resilience and

977
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,080
the importance of industry and public

978
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,760
private partnerships in addressing that

979
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,039
as well so

980
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,200
it helps to have this data then to back

981
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,799
it up

982
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,239
we might go slightly over we can get the

983
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,320
last two people in

984
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,918
hi it's john mulholl from irish tech

985
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,719
news thanks for the talk um

986
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,560
great commentary and great information

987
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,040
around what's happening nationally

988
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,960
with your efforts and the partnerships

989
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,399
you've developed

990
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,839
what's your position or what's your

991
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,520
thoughts around

992
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,159
the need for an international agency

993
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,839
that is

994
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,440
one of a better word matching the world

995
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,679
wide web in terms of scope because that

996
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,839
really is the attack surface

997
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,800
for all cyber threats that come in to

998
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,040
ireland the hsc of course got hit with a

999
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,239
ransomware attack that was an

1000
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,639
international attack and the vast

1001
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,639
majority attacks are international and

1002
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,079
the pole poll serious

1003
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,000
risk to government and industry and

1004
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,918
indeed the people via the hse example

1005
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,520
well this this is an easy answer i'm not

1006
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,040
a technical person so i'm going to leave

1007
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,520
that to the experts yeah okay

1008
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,119
all right thank you okay last question

1009
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,520
please thanks

1010
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,320
hey that was a really good talk uh i'm

1011
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,480
keen i lead a security response

1012
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,640
team for a multinational and i'm just

1013
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,240
curious to hear your thoughts about

1014
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,599
workforce alignment um you touched off

1015
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,440
you know the pipeline getting graduates

1016
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,240
into companies right in different roles

1017
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,760
and what we're finding

1018
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,079
is yes there's graduates coming online

1019
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,359
but often

1020
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,440
they go through a four-year course and

1021
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,720
maybe in the year four they do a big

1022
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,640
shop project where they kind of applied

1023
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,160
theory and then they're ready for the

1024
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,720
workforce but to be to be to be frank

1025
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,760
some of them kind of lack that

1026
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
tacit knowledge right that you pick up

1027
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,000
in the workforce and we often look to

1028
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,480
bring in graduates midway through you

1029
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,000
know summer internships are you know

1030
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,240
during easter holidays or whatever but

1031
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,119
it's

1032
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,520
never easy and i feel a lot of it is is

1033
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,440
a consequence of

1034
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,119
no real relationships between

1035
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,800
corporations and the academic

1036
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,320
institutions not only in ireland but

1037
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,160
elsewhere and i just want to kind of

1038
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,359
hear your thoughts about maybe how we

1039
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,200
could bridge that gap and and bring

1040
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,760
people in sooner so that they get actual

1041
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,520
experience while they're learning to

1042
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,280
theory over that two three or four year

1043
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,560
degree

1044
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,920
yeah you've hit the nail on the head

1045
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,760
that was one of the key kind of

1046
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,200
challenges coming back from industry

1047
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,720
that the graduates coming out weren't

1048
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,320
ready to move into the roles that were

1049
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,240
there and so i suppose that's looking at

1050
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,599
um

1051
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,359
inputting on the course modules that are

1052
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,119
there across stem

1053
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,680
courses and making sure that you have

1054
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,440
industry lecturers coming in as guest

1055
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,520
speakers looking at what technologies

1056
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,200
are there as well

1057
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,560
and making sure that companies are

1058
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,640
providing actual opportunities for

1059
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,880
people in third gear to go in and work

1060
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,880
in cyber security and internships and

1061
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,560
having graduate programs there as well

1062
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,000
so one of the areas we're looking at is

1063
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,720
a

1064
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,520
federated cybersecurity graduate program

1065
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,920
where we're linking up a number of

1066
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,920
companies that are providing graduate

1067
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,000
roles in cyber security that they're

1068
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,760
coming in and actually they're on a

1069
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,200
similar program where they're getting

1070
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,640
the technical skills but also the

1071
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,720
non-technical skills as well and that

1072
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,000
these graduates are meeting with each

1073
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,680
other so they're part of a group but

1074
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,040
yeah i'd be happy to talk about it

1075
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,240
further afterwards

1076
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,320
all right thank you very much excellent

1077
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,940
