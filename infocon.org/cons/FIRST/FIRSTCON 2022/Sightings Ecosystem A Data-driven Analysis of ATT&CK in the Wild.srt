so welcome everybody to the first

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,160
session of the afternoon and the

4

second one

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,039
to be finished the first day so

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,240
this talk is tlp wide so you can take

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,840
pictures and

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,000
all that stuff please remember if you

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,840
have any questions after the talk we

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,640
have a microphone in the alt so please

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,800
line up with the microphones there's

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,120
also a survey so if you have the first

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,360
the official first app please fill out

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,440
the survey for the speakers after the

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,320
talk

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,320
if you have any devices that can make

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,960
noises or stop the speakers please be so

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,039
kind and turn them off

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,280
good and now we'll see a talk by two

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,399
speakers the first speaker is callan

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,800
she's a senior cyber threat intelligence

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,520
analyst at mitra and the second speaker

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,480
is mike who is a lead cyber operations

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,800
engineer also at mitra

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,160
and they're going to talk about the

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,479
cytix ecosystem which is a community

27
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,360
driven effort to track attack tactics

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,439
seen in the wild and also a good example

29
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,840
of what the cyber security community can

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,840
accomplish when we all work together in

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,360
the public interest

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,280
so give them a warm round of applause

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,960
and let's start with the talk

34
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,360
thank you

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,600
welcome everyone to sightings ecosystem

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,600
a data-driven analysis of attack in the

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
wild

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,040
good afternoon my name is kellen

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,119
wagner-ramsell i'm a lead cyber threat

40
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,200
intelligence analyst at mitre where i

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,720
also support the center for threat and

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,040
form defense who sponsored and led the

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,399
research we're going to be talking about

44
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,439
today

45
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,280
i've been with mitre for a little over a

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,200
year but i spent most of my career in

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,720
state and local government in the united

48
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,040
states where i was responding and

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,479
investigating

50
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,799
all crimes involving computers so that's

51
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,520
everything from ransomware to gas pump

52
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,960
skimmers

53
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,560
i am married my husband rob and i we

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,240
live in the dc area in the united states

55
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
with our dog pete

56
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,159
my name is mike cunningham i'm the r d

57
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,680
program manager at the center for threat

58
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,598
form defense i've been a miter lit over

59
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,520
five years and before that i was an

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,480
interactive ball net operator at the nsa

61
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,400
i live in sunny san diego with my wife

62
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,200
amy we have three daughters and we have

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,160
a golden doodle named sunny

64
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,840
and as kelton mentioned the center for

65
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,120
threat informed events was the main

66
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,760
sponsor for this research effort and the

67
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,840
center is a

68
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,959
privately funded research and

69
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,879
development center that partners with

70
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,800
private industry to solve difficult

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,400
problems so we bring together some of

72
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,239
the best security teams in the world we

73
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,640
compare that with mitre's objective

74
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,120
research abilities and we solve problems

75
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,720
to help advance the state of the art for

76
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,400
threat and form defense and the state of

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,760
practice

78
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,599
and one of those oh at our sighting

79
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,280
participants our main research

80
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,280
collaborators for this effort was attack

81
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,879
iq hca healthcare fortinet the global

82
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,680
security alliance and verizon and along

83
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,680
with that we had data contributors from

84
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,879
red canary connectwise and first imagery

85
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,000
and some other unnamed partners

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,319
now a problem that we noticed was that

87
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,720
defenders lack visibility into adversary

88
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,239
behaviors so we have this awesome

89
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,159
resource which is attack

90
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,040
which

91
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,040
tries to capture all adversary behavior

92
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,959
that is seen in public reporting and

93
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,040
what tack is not meant to do is be a

94
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,519
day-to-day analysis of what defenders

95
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,599
are actually doing in order to get some

96
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,599
insight into what the

97
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,519
adversaries are actually doing we can

98
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,920
turn to cti reporting

99
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,159
now cti reporting has a lot of benefits

100
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,840
it can provide us valuable information

101
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,400
on adversaries it discusses novel

102
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
techniques when we see adversaries

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,319
change their trade craft or innovate new

104
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,680
techniques

105
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,920
it's excellent for creating adversary

106
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,000
profiles we can take that information

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,760
about a specific adversary and their

108
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,080
tradecraft build those profiles by which

109
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,360
to inform our detections our

110
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,280
investigations and even attribution if

111
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,040
we do that

112
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,760
attack itself was built on cti and

113
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,959
public reporting of threat actors

114
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,680
however when it comes to informing

115
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,080
defenders there are some limitations in

116
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
cti reporting

117
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,920
first and foremost there are various

118
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,000
biases that impact reporting i don't

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,759
think a cti

120
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,839
conference is complete without talking

121
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,680
about biases so

122
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,360
um but we have

123
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,479
first and foremost when we think of

124
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,800
defenders a novelty bias issue

125
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,680
cti when we're producing reports we have

126
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,440
a reporting threshold we have to meet it

127
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,520
has to be justified because we can't put

128
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,280
out a report on every single thing we

129
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,080
see

130
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,919
otherwise we're inundating and

131
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,840
overwhelming our consumers and making

132
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,759
our work unhelpful

133
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,840
so we have to pick something to focus

134
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,040
and that often means we write on novelty

135
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,440
there's also a visibility bias

136
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,000
we when we produce cti are limited by

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
what we can see

138
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,360
so that might be based on where our

139
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,880
customers are or what industry our

140
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,720
customers are in it might be based on

141
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,479
our sensors or our technology and where

142
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,080
we monitor

143
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,240
the end result is me as a cti analyst

144
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,479
producing

145
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,000
what i'm seeing in state and local

146
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,120
government

147
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,639
might not be as useful to someone

148
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,720
defending the energy sector in the in

149
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,479
europe say

150
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,880
so we have that visibility bias too

151
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,720
there are many other biases i'm not

152
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,360
going to go into all of them

153
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,880
but those biases then lead into this

154
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,960
other thing of this question when we

155
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
look at cti reporting

156
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,960
is this content evidence of something

157
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,840
pervasive or just a flash in the pan

158
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,919
are we writing a report about a threat

159
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,400
actor's innovative use of steganography

160
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,120
or are we seeing the standard uh

161
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,520
phishing email with a link and those

162
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,039
standard activities associated with

163
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,759
emote or trickbot or quackbot

164
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,199
that maybe we don't write on those every

165
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,360
time because we see them every day but

166
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,960
we will write about that innovative use

167
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,720
of steganography

168
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,320
then defenders who are consuming it are

169
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,919
like wait should i look here or should i

170
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,520
look at that thing we are seeing all the

171
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,319
time so how do we prioritize

172
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,280
based on all of these intricacies of

173
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,039
cyber reporting which is where we went

174
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,039
to the sightings ecosystem

175
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,039
so we have this idea to help overcome

176
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,280
some of these biases if we engage the

177
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,600
global community to collect and share

178
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,520
sightings data we could hopefully help

179
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,360
give a better idea of what's actually

180
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,880
happening in the wild

181
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,639
and so what is a sighting

182
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,240
a sighting is one or more attack

183
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
techniques that have been observed being

184
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,280
used by an adversary on or to target

185
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,360
victim infrastructure and exciting is

186
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,000
not a lot of data it's a json file that

187
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,240
has technique id it has the time it

188
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,880
occurred uh the operating system

189
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,199
potentially the sector uh the region

190
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,639
that the sighting was seen so it's a

191
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,400
real small amount of data but it's also

192
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,280
a really powerful uh bit of data

193
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,479
and so as we go out to the global

194
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,319
community and we start crowdsourcing

195
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,199
this

196
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,199
we needed to convince the community to

197
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,120
work in the public interest it's

198
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,880
difficult to go out and ask these

199
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,360
vendors to share their private sensitive

200
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,440
data with us to help us do this research

201
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
effort where they might not see a dollar

202
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,520
for dollar return on that effort but we

203
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,919
engaged in a long campaign to connect

204
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,360
with a lot of our

205
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,520
network something we're doing here um

206
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,800
and fine vendors that wanted to share

207
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,199
their attack specific data with us

208
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,880
we also had to convince them that we had

209
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,120
a safe way to share these sightings so

210
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,240
as i mentioned the data they have is

211
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,319
very sensitive some of these vendors

212
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,319
they don't actually own the data it's

213
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,560
customer data but we had to make sure

214
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,400
that they felt that we were going to be

215
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,759
good stewards of the data we're going to

216
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,039
do everything we can to protect that

217
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,800
data so we did some research into

218
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,400
differential privacy to ensure that

219
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,080
there's no way that if for some reason

220
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,599
this data got out

221
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,199
that anyone could be able to reverse

222
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,280
engineer and trace it back to

223
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,919
either the winner from which it came or

224
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,680
the customers from which that data came

225
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,440
we also wanted to develop a public

226
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,840
option for everybody to use so as we get

227
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,240
into the research that was conducted we

228
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,160
had to build a pipeline to process our

229
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,440
attack data

230
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,759
to perform the analysis on the data and

231
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,800
we didn't want to keep that for

232
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,400
ourselves everything we do is working in

233
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,479
the public interest so if there were

234
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,879
some companies organizations that have a

235
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,000
lot of data but they didn't feel

236
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,759
comfortable sharing it we want to be

237
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,599
able to provide the tools for them to do

238
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,759
their own analysis their own sightings

239
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,440
work so that way they can see the most

240
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,599
common techniques that are taking place

241
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,000
within their networks

242
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,919
so once we got all that data

243
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,280
what did we get

244
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,960
we got six million different techniques

245
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,240
from with that we did some

246
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,479
normalizations of the data and we paired

247
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,560
that down to 1.1 million usable

248
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,599
techniques

249
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,039
now we had 184 unique techniques

250
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,799
and the date range from that was between

251
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,120
april 2019 and july 2021

252
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,120
so when we talk about that drop from 6

253
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,519
million to 1.1 million that we analyzed

254
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,040
some of that was in the data cleaning

255
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,600
process um i think our original data set

256
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,440
when we just took our raw collection

257
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,640
ranged from 1980 to 2040

258
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,399
so obviously there were some errors

259
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,480
there we had to remove that information

260
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,160
we also did a preliminary frequency

261
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,000
analysis where we saw any truly

262
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,519
anomalous spikes

263
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,000
there was one technique from one source

264
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,720
that

265
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,040
just far and above rose the others and

266
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,560
they confirmed that that was an error so

267
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,560
we removed that and then we were left

268
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,920
with those

269
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,560
a year and a half or

270
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,080
yeah about a year and a half's worth of

271
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,720
data 1.1 million sightings and that's

272
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,440
1.1 million observed techniques across

273
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,320
800 000 sightings some sightings contain

274
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,680
multiple techniques which will become

275
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,640
relevant in a few minutes we saw 184

276
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,760
unique techniques and sub techniques

277
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,279
our results

278
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,440
they are published in a i am so sorry

279
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,000
for the length 50 page report

280
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
the report is partially that long

281
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,920
because we include for every technique

282
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,440
in the top list

283
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,040
we include things like links to the

284
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,200
cyber analytics repository to sigma

285
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,600
analytics to the united states national

286
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,440
institute of standards and technologies

287
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,560
853 security controls we directly

288
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,240
provide the defense information here

289
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,519
recognizing

290
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,000
hey our defenders are busy let's give a

291
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,440
starting point you don't know where to

292
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,480
prioritize

293
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,000
we're saying this list can help you

294
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,240
prioritize and here's what you can do

295
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,760
about it

296
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,279
but what day did we actually find what

297
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,279
techniques are we seeing we're ready we

298
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,600
have this huge miter attack framework

299
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,480
and we get our data

300
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,760
90 of the data was 15 techniques now

301
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,440
some of these techniques sure we had sub

302
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,560
techniques

303
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,120
but 15 techniques accounted for 90 of

304
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,160
the data

305
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,680
oof all right

306
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,519
that's that's kind that was surprising

307
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,920
to us we expected to see more

308
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,560
and then we looked further and over half

309
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,640
of our data set was made up of only

310
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,160
three techniques

311
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,519
i'll talk about which techniques in a

312
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,040
second but it was kind of that question

313
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,560
of all right what does that reflect

314
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,079
about our detections and how well they

315
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,279
map to attack what does that tell us

316
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,640
but we were still able to gain some

317
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,160
interesting insights

318
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,680
so when we break out our top five

319
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,800
because i'm not going to talk through

320
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,560
all 15 today

321
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,560
number one and number two these aren't

322
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,480
surprising scheduled task job and

323
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
command and scripting interpreter

324
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,560
we know adversaries are using living off

325
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,079
the land techniques they're using those

326
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,640
legitimate tools to evade detections

327
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,480
well this reflects that they're using

328
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,959
our standard tools

329
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,519
within scheduled task and job we saw

330
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,519
what you would expect scheduled task as

331
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,000
a sub technique but we also saw cron

332
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,959
which to us was up was a good thing

333
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,560
because it meant our data set compa

334
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,640
encompassed both windows systems and

335
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,720
linux or mac os so we did actually have

336
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,880
not just windows systems presented here

337
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,519
not a lot but some

338
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,959
with command and scripting interpreter

339
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,240
the breakdown was what you would expect

340
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,920
we saw a lot of power cell we saw a lot

341
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,079
of windows command shell

342
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,480
basic stuff adversaries are

343
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,640
using command line no one's really

344
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,399
surprised there

345
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,399
we then saw hijack execution flow as

346
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,680
number three

347
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,600
and that one

348
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,760
we were a little surprised to see it but

349
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,600
it makes sense and in fact when we talk

350
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,279
about sub techniques most the

351
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,760
observations for this technique was dll

352
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,600
search order hijacking

353
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,440
so we see adversaries use that in a lot

354
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,959
of different ways for a lot of different

355
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,399
reasons so it makes sense that it's

356
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,040
coming in at number three

357
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,040
number four and five

358
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,880
all right proxy and non-application

359
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,800
layer protocol they both come in at

360
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
eight percent of the data set

361
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,399
that'll become relevant again in a few

362
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,399
minutes um but again all right

363
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,000
adversaries are trying to avoid using

364
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,279
standard paths and they're trying to

365
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,800
obscure their origin

366
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,959
none of this was outright shocking but

367
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,120
here we have clear proof that

368
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,320
adversaries are doing that

369
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,639
so when i mentioned four and five

370
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,720
non-application layer protocol and proxy

371
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,880
were both the same amounts

372
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,639
within this analysis we did a

373
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,399
co-occurrence analysis

374
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,240
so with the sightings data we sought to

375
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,880
identify sequence how are adversaries

376
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,360
using attack techniques in sequence

377
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,880
because we know if we have sequence we

378
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,320
can start informing better risk-based

379
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,000
alerting we can start doing process

380
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,279
mining and learning more about our

381
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,600
adversary's activities

382
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,200
we couldn't get sequence in our

383
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,399
sightings

384
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,720
but we could get co-occurrence so we

385
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,480
could see where multiple techniques were

386
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,399
used in the same event and we had some

387
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,839
of our contributors were able to link

388
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,279
that together

389
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,959
so with that co-occurrence data we were

390
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,959
able to perform association rule mining

391
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,480
it's a data science technique i'm not

392
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,000
going to go super in depth on it we can

393
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,440
chat afterwards if you're interested in

394
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,800
that process

395
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,880
but to identify links where when we see

396
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,120
one technique in excess of fifty percent

397
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,480
of the time we see the second technique

398
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,320
both proxy and non-application layer

399
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,480
protocol we saw that these two almost

400
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,399
always occurred together

401
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,040
that eight percent they were always just

402
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,519
right there when the other one was used

403
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,600
okay that's helpful

404
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,839
but our main cluster of findings found

405
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,920
that command and scripting interpreter

406
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,079
you is used as a facilitator for most

407
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,199
techniques

408
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,560
you can see in this cluster i know it's

409
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,160
kind of small there's a full report with

410
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,240
it and you can zoom in however you want

411
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,160
but command and scripting interpreter

412
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,160
helps and is observed a lot of other

413
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,839
techniques we see it with masquerading

414
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,600
we see it with obfuscated files or

415
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,079
information

416
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,000
so what does that mean we're here we're

417
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,839
doing this work to inform defenders does

418
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,519
that mean when we build our analytics we

419
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,920
tie command and scripting interpreter to

420
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,000
our alert for another technique maybe so

421
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,279
instead of you getting two alerts you

422
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,199
get them connected or what does it mean

423
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,639
for how we form our detections for

424
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,839
command and scripting interpreter

425
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,920
there's a lot of options here

426
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,920
depending on your specific risk register

427
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,000
the maturity of your organization but we

428
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,639
can glean some useful insights from this

429
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,199
idea of a co-occurrence analysis

430
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,680
i will also highlight we saw one chain

431
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,760
of three techniques that typically occur

432
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,360
together and that's command and

433
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,399
scripting interpreter to impair defenses

434
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,720
to indicator removal on host

435
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,199
again not surprising but it is nice to

436
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,800
have those things we assumed and those

437
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,920
things we thought we knew about

438
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,760
adversaries confirmed in the data

439
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,680
so outside of finding out what are the

440
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,720
most common techniques that are

441
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,320
happening what else did we learn

442
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,399
we learned that defense is hard i don't

443
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,440
know if we learned i guess it further

444
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,199
cement that the other defense is hard i

445
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,160
don't think we'd all be at these

446
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,920
conferences every year if defense was

447
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,800
easy

448
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,120
but what makes it hard we have defenders

449
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,040
that are overworked uh when we reached

450
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,199
out to many different organizations the

451
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,680
most common rejection we got was this is

452
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,199
great i really want to contribute but we

453
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,279
don't have the people the resources to

454
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,760
allocate to develop a plug-in for our

455
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,160
sim or to write some sort of script to

456
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,639
export from the edr platform

457
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,839
so they just wanted help but they didn't

458
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,959
have the resources they didn't have the

459
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,240
main they were focused on their

460
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,000
company's main mission

461
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,399
and our stocks are also underfunded so

462
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,079
we find oftentimes that the threat

463
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,160
intelligence team might be one person

464
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,440
there might be a one-person incident

465
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,040
response team there might be a

466
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,880
one-person malware analysis team and

467
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,720
sometimes that's all the same person and

468
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,480
when you're trying to do this community

469
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,160
effort of

470
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,320
helping out defenders essentially for

471
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,600
free

472
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,360
it's hard to convince those people to

473
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,000
dedicate extra cycles to this type of

474
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,279
effort

475
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,120
and we also want to reiterate that

476
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,279
prioritization is critical you look at

477
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,160
the attack matrix here um it's huge it's

478
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,519
about 576 techniques right now i think

479
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,680
that's a lot to take on and especially

480
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,759
for defenders and teams who don't have a

481
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,399
ton of resources where do they start

482
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,040
if mitre releases a new technique are we

483
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,680
then telling you guys who go and focus

484
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,040
your defenses on this technique and now

485
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,320
you need to write a detection for this

486
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,600
technique

487
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,079
not necessarily but maybe i don't that's

488
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,519
something each organization needs to

489
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,959
prioritize

490
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,560
and also

491
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,120
if you're not prioritizing your defenses

492
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,160
you're going to leave yourself with a

493
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,240
bunch of blind spots

494
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,839
so sightings gives you

495
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,279
you don't have to look at all 500

496
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,959
techniques if that's not within your

497
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,279
realm of possibility you can start by

498
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,120
looking at 15 depending on your risk

499
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,480
register again

500
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,959
it's a starting place

501
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,800
so our solution

502
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,040
that we've built again we talk about

503
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,120
crowdsourcing we talk about community uh

504
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,759
contributions we're able to leverage

505
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,320
global data from myriad sources to prove

506
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
out our hypothesis which was if we all

507
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,240
come together and the motto of this

508
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,000
conference is here is strength together

509
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,480
so if we all work together we can have

510
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,119
more higher fidelity results we're able

511
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,839
to bring together endpoint vendors

512
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,280
network vendors

513
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,359
mssps email

514
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,919
providers all these different resources

515
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,679
that one specific vendor doesn't have

516
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,400
access to we're able to contribute um

517
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,079
all that and come up with different

518
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,880
results and one of the things that was

519
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,720
interesting that we found was red canary

520
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,240
as i mentioned it was one of our data

521
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,080
contributors every year they put out a

522
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,880
threat incident report which highlights

523
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,799
the top 10 techniques that they have

524
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,760
seen

525
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,520
when we compared our list to their list

526
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,520
it was markedly different we had a lot

527
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,039
of the same techniques

528
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,240
scripting

529
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,080
command scripting interpreter scheduled

530
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,520
jobs we're going to see those but

531
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,039
they're in different orders

532
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,720
and to us when we bring in these other

533
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,960
contributors that have insights into

534
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,039
network traffic that have insights into

535
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,600
email traffic we get different results

536
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,440
and that proves out the hypothesis that

537
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,799
we had at the beginning of this research

538
00:17:58,799 --> 00:17:59,679
effort

539
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,160
and also developing open source tools

540
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,440
something we're really passionate about

541
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,000
at mitre and i think that it shows we we

542
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,760
have a lot of great open source tools

543
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,919
that we probably all use

544
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,360
we have sigma hq which is a great

545
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,679
analytic repository we have missed that

546
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,200
i'm sure a lot of us use

547
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,039
we have these open source projects that

548
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,960
have proven to be really effective and

549
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,679
really powerful and we keep building up

550
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,600
that toolbox um it's just going to make

551
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,880
things a lot more difficult for

552
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,000
defenders

553
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,600
or adversaries for adversaries also them

554
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,720
thank you

555
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,360
um and then also crowdsourcing this data

556
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,440
allows us to prioritize based off of

557
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,840
real-world data if we just go based off

558
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,080
of uh the most common reports or the

559
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,799
most

560
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,480
the newest reports we might have a

561
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,240
different idea of where to prioritize as

562
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,080
kellem mentioned earlier we talk about

563
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,120
emo tech trickbot quackbot we see that

564
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,039
happening a lot and it does but how much

565
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,960
is a lot and is it actually happening

566
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,559
more than we might see some other

567
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,200
specific techniques and so bringing all

568
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,039
the community together crowdsourcing it

569
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,039
helps us prioritize based off of real

570
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,160
world data

571
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,400
yeah and we didn't just look at the

572
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,559
sightings data which we did but once we

573
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,160
pulled out the detections or the

574
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,640
security controls that are most

575
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,240
associated with the various techniques

576
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,880
we observed in that top 15 list we did

577
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,480
our own little analysis of hey what's

578
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,160
security controls what are the top 10

579
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,440
that are going to give you the best

580
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,679
coverage for these techniques

581
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,440
we don't have them listed here but again

582
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,960
they're in the report

583
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,799
i mean they they are what we expect it's

584
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,039
it's identifying

585
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,720
adversaries

586
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,840
masquerading as legitimate users but we

587
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,280
were able to break that down so we could

588
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,679
prioritize and look based on what

589
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,360
the data is showing adversaries are

590
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,678
doing

591
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,760
but limitations

592
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,679
there were a lot this was this was the

593
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,919
first effort of

594
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,120
taking data from multiple sources taking

595
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,440
large scale attack data

596
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,799
sightings data

597
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,160
so we encountered some stumbling blocks

598
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
and one of those sightings is limited by

599
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,400
its contributors so we knew that going

600
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,720
in we knew okay we're saying cti has a

601
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,480
visibility bias we're saying reporting

602
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,799
from a single organization is limited to

603
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,480
their visibility

604
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,120
well in this report we had a limited

605
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,039
number of contributors we hoped to get

606
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:15,919
more

607
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,640
but due to various concerns and issues

608
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,360
and

609
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,760
just being the first round we had a very

610
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,200
small number

611
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,039
that means that this data it might not

612
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,720
be exact what all industries are seeing

613
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,480
or what all regions or depending on what

614
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,880
technology you have in your stack

615
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,720
it might not be exactly applicable to

616
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,320
your organization because our visibility

617
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,640
was limited

618
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,120
it's not easy being mapped to attack

619
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,120
that's another

620
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,679
major limitation within the sightings

621
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,120
ecosystem is

622
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,559
we had some contributors who were

623
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,240
gung-ho they were like yeah we'd love to

624
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,240
do this getting data-driven analysis of

625
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,960
what adversaries are doing in the wild

626
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,840
great

627
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,159
wait we don't map our data to attack

628
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,880
so right there we couldn't go forward

629
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
then for those organizations that map to

630
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,120
attack there's that question of what

631
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,280
techniques can be mapped to attack

632
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,200
because not all really map well in an

633
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,360
automated fashion where we can say hey

634
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,520
if we observe these specific

635
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,919
observables they're likely associated

636
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,720
with this miter attack technique

637
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,799
not all works super well for that so

638
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,720
this data we can't capture those

639
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,960
techniques that are hard to map

640
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,039
we're also probably going to be relying

641
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,280
on those detections

642
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,880
that are more robust and that have been

643
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,400
built in so we do have a little bit of a

644
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,799
detections bias almost in there of

645
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,080
all right we don't

646
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,440
that question of we don't know our

647
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,360
unknown unknowns and so that's that's

648
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,360
obviously still here

649
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,360
but that's maybe where the novelty bias

650
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,280
in cti reporting is helpful to kind of

651
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,360
fill in those gaps but it's not easy to

652
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,000
map to attack was one of our hard parts

653
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,840
and then the big limitation

654
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,880
i saw as a data analyst was

655
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,559
when you're analyzing this data you

656
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,679
learn as much about yourself if not more

657
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,200
than you do about your enemy it's that

658
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,799
that age-old analysis thing of when

659
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,000
you're analyzing

660
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,840
someone else you end up saying a lot

661
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,559
more about yourself um

662
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,400
it was really hard for me to look at our

663
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
data to break it down and be like

664
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,280
definitively adversaries are doing this

665
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,240
because every time i looked at some set

666
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,280
of data there was that question of

667
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,559
wait wait

668
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,640
was that the adversary or was that

669
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,039
defenders tweaking a detection did they

670
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,120
add a new detection did they tweak a

671
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,799
detection maybe it was adversaries

672
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,559
finding a way around a detection maybe

673
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,400
it was adding things

674
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,320
i couldn't make a meaningful conclusion

675
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,600
and say yes

676
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,120
i have high confidence that the

677
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,520
adversaries were doing this because i

678
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,280
didn't know what the defenders were

679
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,159
doing

680
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,080
now to me i was

681
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,840
i i had this realization and i was like

682
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,360
i'm i'm ready to throw in the towel like

683
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,200
i can't say anything about adversaries

684
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,480
and i'm pretty sure mike was ready to

685
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,559
vote me off the team because of that you

686
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,440
know good versus perfect conversation

687
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,000
so i stuck with it and he stuck with me

688
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,240
and i did find we talked so much about

689
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,240
tracking our adversaries and tracking

690
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,840
like the concept of change management

691
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,039
and tracking our vulnerability

692
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,720
management

693
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,000
what are we doing to track our

694
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,360
detections

695
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,200
are we tracking when we make a change in

696
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,400
our detections

697
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,840
is that an opportunity there how would

698
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,039
we do that i understand that's a

699
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,760
burdensome issue or it could be

700
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,600
but if we are tracking our detections

701
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,039
that might help us in our return on

702
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,799
investment conversations with our

703
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,200
leadership because we can say hey

704
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,360
we implemented this detection

705
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,120
and then we saw a spike in adversary

706
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,000
activity associated with that technique

707
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,440
there is a high likelihood that that

708
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,880
activity was occurring before and we

709
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,039
weren't detecting it so now we have that

710
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,640
return on investment opportunity to

711
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,600
explain and show hey we're helping

712
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,520
in the same vein if we're tracking our

713
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,480
detections and we see adversary activity

714
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,760
fall off

715
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,559
and we're like all right did we make a

716
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,320
change in our detections that broke it

717
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,559
all right then we can fix it

718
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,320
or alternatively is that a sign that

719
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,919
adversaries have found a way of evading

720
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,840
our detections so then we have even

721
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,679
better insight into what our adversaries

722
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,600
are doing because we know what we are

723
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,640
doing

724
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,159
it was one something i definitely wasn't

725
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,240
expecting coming into this and i thought

726
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,120
was really interesting to find

727
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,120
so here's a graph of our year by year i

728
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,640
know it's really small and hard to see

729
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,640
again there's in the report but i'll

730
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,720
kind of talk through so when we break

731
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,640
out our techniques year over year and

732
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,159
this this data was normalized because

733
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,360
obviously

734
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,840
we had a partial year for 2019 a partial

735
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,200
year for 2021 in the full year of 2020.

736
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,880
so for this we normalized it by

737
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,200
technique per day count

738
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,279
just to get some evenness

739
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,760
and we were able to see on the left side

740
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,919
that's scheduled task job or top

741
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,400
technique we saw it increasing

742
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,480
all right is that adversary increasing

743
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
or is that adding new detections for

744
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,840
that technique

745
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,799
i have

746
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,240
no idea

747
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,360
but there are other points where i was

748
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,880
like okay maybe this is the adversary oh

749
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,240
we're seeing adversaries use a new

750
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,760
technique uh 1574 which is the hijack

751
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,720
execution order the third technique

752
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,480
i was like wow there was nothing of it

753
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,120
in 2019 and then it spiked in 2021

754
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,320
that's a clear sign that like

755
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,760
adversaries are like innovative

756
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,720
technique

757
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,840
uh

758
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,240
miter attack didn't include that

759
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,960
technique until 2020. so again there's

760
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,720
that tracking your detections if i was

761
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,080
all ready to be like here i have a clear

762
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,840
thing of adversaries doing something and

763
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,000
i definitely don't

764
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,240
but doing this type of analysis was also

765
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,960
interesting because when we look at

766
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,200
the fourth and the fifth top proxy and

767
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,440
non-application layer protocol

768
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,880
we saw them both bottom out in 2020 or

769
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,880
pardon me 2021

770
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,440
and i was like all right

771
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,400
i know for a certain adversaries are

772
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,880
still using proxy and non-application

773
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,640
layer protocol

774
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,159
so to me that was

775
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,799
are they evading our detections

776
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,720
uh i don't i don't know for certain

777
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,600
maybe that could be um

778
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
is that maybe a question that we when we

779
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,039
look at doing sightings too we need to

780
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,320
be prepared to engage with our

781
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,840
contributors of

782
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,720
hey

783
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,039
any reason you're seeing this not happen

784
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,000
because i

785
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
i know for certain

786
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,640
adversaries are still using proxies in

787
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,440
2021 i think we can all say yeah no they

788
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,039
they use those so there was kind of that

789
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,840
question um which then raises the kind

790
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,360
of all their we learned a lot about

791
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,880
detections and

792
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,480
doing a frequency analysis with your

793
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,400
detections every once in a while

794
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,240
might show where your sensors might need

795
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,840
some refining your detections might need

796
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,520
some refining because when we did

797
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,679
frequency analysis there was a lot of oh

798
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,360
boy how are we mapping and how are we

799
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,200
tracking but

800
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,960
the big thing you learn a lot about

801
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,480
attackers well we learned a little about

802
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,760
attackers but we learned a lot about

803
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,760
defense and one of the clear takeaways

804
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,640
was

805
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,240
try and start tracking your detections

806
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,480
and when you're changing them

807
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,840
so what are some things that we can do

808
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,000
to get better in this area

809
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,080
the most obvious one is to have more

810
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,080
data which means more contributors the

811
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,080
more contributors we have the higher

812
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,640
fidelity our data is going to be so we

813
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,559
mentioned our specific contributors we

814
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,720
mentioned some of the biases

815
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,400
we're not exactly sure where their

816
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,159
biases lay if they have detections that

817
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,880
are more tuned towards endpoint activity

818
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,360
um towards scheduled tasks towards

819
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,840
network activity the more data we get if

820
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,440
we turn that six million sightings we

821
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,240
got into 100 million or a billion then

822
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,760
what kind of data are we going to have

823
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,279
calen keeps asking a lot of questions

824
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,200
that we don't really have the answers to

825
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,279
but if we increase that data set we will

826
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,559
be able to come up with some of those

827
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,279
answers a little bit more clearly

828
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,960
we also need a regular auditing of our

829
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,640
detections as i mentioned you need to

830
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,360
know yourself um those analytics that

831
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,760
you wrote a while ago a year or two ago

832
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,960
is it still doing what you think it's

833
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,840
doing

834
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,760
we see a lot of heat maps we get asked

835
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,760
about heat maps all the time i'm sure

836
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
your bosses have asked for heat maps and

837
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,679
you see your heat map with attack and

838
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,000
you say hey here all the defenses they

839
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,760
cover all of these techniques here so

840
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,840
these are all green we're good that map

841
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,919
was made a year ago has that technique

842
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,320
that was green a year ago has it changed

843
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,399
does it have a new sub technique

844
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,679
if you're not regularly auditing your

845
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,279
detections you're not going to be able

846
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,080
to

847
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,600
know that information

848
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,960
and as we talked about earlier teams are

849
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,640
small and that's hard to do so maybe

850
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,120
something you do quarterly or um twice a

851
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,200
year anything that you can start running

852
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,000
some

853
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,320
analytics on your own analytics you can

854
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,799
become a better defender

855
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,720
then we also want to create a public

856
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,600
portal for data exploration um kel

857
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,200
mentioned sightings two we're going to

858
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,679
start research on that this fall and one

859
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,840
of our goals is to have a public portal

860
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,520
where people can go and query and

861
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,120
interact with the data

862
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,880
there's a lot of great researchers here

863
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,640
out in the community that probably know

864
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
a lot more things than we do and so they

865
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,159
might have new ideas you might have new

866
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,159
ideas on questions you can ask of the

867
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,240
data we want to make that a resource

868
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,480
that's available for everybody to go to

869
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,960
and perform some awesome research

870
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,399
yeah cause when we talk about the idea

871
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,159
of all right we put out a report saying

872
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,919
like we said okay defenders lack

873
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,360
visibility we want to give them a

874
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,720
day-to-day understanding of what

875
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,960
adversaries are doing and then we put

876
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,520
out a monstrously long like report

877
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,799
talking about what techniques were

878
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,840
observed a year ago we recognize that's

879
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,080
not giving you day-to-day information

880
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,919
this was kind of our our first notional

881
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,600
attempt of what can we get with this

882
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,679
data what do we learn and how do we make

883
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,600
it better and and we've from what we've

884
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,760
heard and what we think public portal

885
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,679
for this data exploration is is really

886
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,039
one of those objectives we want to meet

887
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,159
so how can we get involved how can you

888
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,919
guys get involved um if any of this seem

889
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,360
interesting to you if you're someone who

890
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,360
has data that you can contribute we want

891
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,360
to contribute reach out to us we're

892
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,120
happy to talk about you what that looks

893
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,960
like um how you can improve the

894
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,480
sightings ecosystem

895
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,640
and also are you just a researcher maybe

896
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,320
you have some awesome ideas of how we

897
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,919
can make this a little bit better um

898
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,840
we'd love to share to hear your ideas

899
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,679
everything we do um to mention is for

900
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:48,880
the public community it's all open

901
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,880
source and so whatever gets given to us

902
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,559
we want to give back to the community

903
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,960
just to help uh cyber security around

904
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,360
the world um you can send an email to

905
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,360
the email that's on the screen

906
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,240
and

907
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,399
you can talk to us we will be around

908
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,080
all week we'll be hanging out so if you

909
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,080
want to come up and ask some questions

910
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,240
um with that yeah

911
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,159
uh thank you all questions any questions

912
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,480
oh nice

913
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,159
oh we have questions this is so exciting

914
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,600
so exciting oh yeah

915
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,080
hello yeah yep

916
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,760
first of all i'm i'm really happy that

917
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,600
it finally took off right i i can

918
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,000
remember rich trying to get it started

919
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,080
and it now did so that's excellent i

920
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,720
think one one thing that i was missing

921
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,960
and i might have missed it is detection

922
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,279
quality and the amount of and and maybe

923
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,559
to phrase that a little bit so there's a

924
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,320
couple of things there that like false

925
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,840
positive rates

926
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,159
that probably are there because million

927
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,640
sightings with a handful of contributors

928
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,919
i i don't buy yeah um so that's one and

929
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,919
then that that is also sort of tunnel

930
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,000
vision now into the detections that they

931
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,240
actually had because i

932
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,399
if you look at the co-occurrence sheet i

933
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,000
would expect a lot more right so they're

934
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,760
they're missing a lot of stuff and

935
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,840
that's not your fault that's just

936
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,760
all these providers so that's that will

937
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,840
be an interesting thing to maybe add to

938
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,039
the next

939
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,960
session where you can review part of

940
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,320
that detection to see how good that

941
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,039
detection is actually are to value their

942
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,799
contribution maybe

943
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,120
yeah definitely that was something we

944
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,440
i definitely noticed i think mike is

945
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,880
probably getting a little bit of deja vu

946
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,480
at the moment of like because there's

947
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,640
also that question of how well does a

948
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,559
detection cover a technique what kind of

949
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,720
coverage do we get how good is it it was

950
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,399
just outside of the scope we we couldn't

951
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,000
get to it this time but

952
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,600
definitely now it would be good to have

953
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,200
more co-occurrences so you can start

954
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,080
build markov chains and so on right yes

955
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,760
exactly and markov chains you're a

956
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,120
little limited without like the sequence

957
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,880
per se and just by having co-occurrence

958
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,519
like it doesn't work as well i'm sorry

959
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,960
um

960
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,159
but

961
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,600
yeah we we recognize that that

962
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,279
co-occurrence graph we also had a fairly

963
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,880
high threshold for the association rule

964
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,679
mining there were more but co-occurrence

965
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,120
was extremely limited

966
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,440
and as far as the data quality we

967
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,039
weren't able to validate the detections

968
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,039
but we did have a field that how did

969
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,960
they validate the data was it machine

970
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,360
validated was it raw or was it human

971
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,760
validated and so that allowed us to give

972
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,120
a little bit more confidence to the ones

973
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,120
that were human validated that this was

974
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,760
a real alert a real detection cool all

975
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,279
right appreciate it thank you thanks

976
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,960
uh thanks for your talk um eric julian

977
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,480
from octa

978
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,360
uh

979
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,159
question quick question between um

980
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,720
did you i don't i'm trying to figure out

981
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,880
how to phrase this but was there did you

982
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,240
were you able to see a distinction

983
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,840
between i guess commodity malware and

984
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,399
like apt i know commodity tends to

985
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,720
happen a lot more often than apt so i

986
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,000
wasn't sure

987
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,080
it was really just the techniques we did

988
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,880
um ask for malware we didn't get a lot

989
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,600
of malware and then we got just hashes

990
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,399
and not

991
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,399
names which then doing the analysis with

992
00:32:58,399 --> 00:32:59,440
hashes

993
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,799
didn't go super well because would you

994
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,480
believe a frequency analysis of hashes

995
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,120
shows a lot of one-offs um

996
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,519
lesson learned there for us

997
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,840
but

998
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,330
we um

999
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,600
[Music]

1000
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,519
yeah we didn't like i was looking for

1001
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,240
that apt versus commodity and because a

1002
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,519
lot of those techniques especially when

1003
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,799
we look at like what ransomware actors

1004
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,080
are doing and like what those trojans

1005
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,360
are doing and some of the features they

1006
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,960
have

1007
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,399
it was hard to see

1008
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,559
for the apt i did look closely at some

1009
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,200
of the the outlier tail

1010
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,399
of the data because like we talked about

1011
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,200
the top 15 here but like there were 184

1012
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,360
techniques in this data site i couldn't

1013
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,559
pull any trends from that outlier tale

1014
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,080
but it was definitely something we

1015
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,080
looked for

1016
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,440
for some of the contributors that gave

1017
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,799
us software it was a lot of adware and

1018
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,080
where do you draw the line between

1019
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,600
what's what's malware that's useful and

1020
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,120
what's just adware what's freeware

1021
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,720
what's junk

1022
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,640
so that was hard we eliminated all of

1023
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,480
those fields for this round

1024
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,919
but that is something we want to improve

1025
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,200
attribution

1026
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,640
is absolutely something we want to look

1027
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,760
into as well

1028
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,320
great thanks a lot

1029
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,600
thank you very much for this

1030
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,520
presentation um

1031
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,399
so if i understood right you based your

1032
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,320
analysis on

1033
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,199
analysis being done by other

1034
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,480
companies

1035
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,918
so the question now was was um

1036
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,839
did you take in consideration the

1037
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:24,800
different

1038
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,918
interpretation interpretations of my

1039
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,239
three attack

1040
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,639
one team could have that another could

1041
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,359
have on the same analysis

1042
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,639
we've tried to do the same thing

1043
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,159
in france with

1044
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,320
a group of of certs and we've seen very

1045
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,560
very different

1046
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,399
interpretation of the same

1047
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:49,599
uh

1048
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,520
analysis of a

1049
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,800
malware and it was very astonishing to

1050
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,160
have this much differences

1051
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,599
yeah and as we kind of talked about

1052
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,200
earlier mapping to attack is very

1053
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,400
difficult

1054
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,160
we didn't have a good mechanism to

1055
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,760
account to make sure that if they marked

1056
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,359
it as command script interpreter that

1057
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,920
that's exactly actually what it was

1058
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,160
our hope is in the future as we get more

1059
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,320
data those types of outliers will kind

1060
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,200
of you know be washed away with the more

1061
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,440
the quality data um did you have another

1062
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,359
take on that no it was it it was

1063
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,119
something that we really grappled with

1064
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,880
but we didn't solve like there was

1065
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,960
obviously that suspect of like all right

1066
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,400
we're pretty sure you're interpreting

1067
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
this differently than someone else

1068
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,920
and there were some where it was like

1069
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,400
there were nominal anomalous spikes of

1070
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,320
techniques particularly if we like did a

1071
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,160
frequency analysis of

1072
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,640
like comparing our contributors i was

1073
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,480
like wait okay maybe this is something

1074
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,320
in the next iteration because we know it

1075
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,839
now exists that we can have like a kind

1076
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,760
of like norming and storming operation

1077
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,760
with our contributors of hey how are we

1078
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,440
doing this but we didn't have an easy

1079
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,200
way to do that

1080
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,078
thanks thanks

1081
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,839
more questions

1082
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,599
oh yes

1083
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,400
yes that's great i just had one just on

1084
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,119
that last bit there um so with maybe

1085
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,960
with the next iteration i mean this is

1086
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,160
awesome i like this idea of like

1087
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,839
starting to bring sightings across all

1088
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,400
these organizations together

1089
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,640
on these contributors you i take it you

1090
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,160
didn't really understand what their

1091
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,000
visibility breadth might be so one

1092
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,520
contributor could have like all their

1093
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,599
sightings coming from one source and

1094
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,440
another could not do you think that

1095
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,880
played into some of those spikes that

1096
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,599
you saw across different orgs or again

1097
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,599
we just didn't have that visibility like

1098
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,720
we didn't build that in like the first

1099
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,079
time we were like let's just get data

1100
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,760
and then we got the data and we went

1101
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,320
right maybe we we should have talked

1102
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,920
more but i mean that's that's what the

1103
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,599
first time is for right um

1104
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,200
we did have conversations with one

1105
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,839
technique in specific um

1106
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,720
uh user execution 1204 where there was a

1107
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,400
huge spike so we reached out to the the

1108
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,160
contributor and ask you know them to

1109
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,680
look into it and this was at a time

1110
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,359
where they were tuning their sensors so

1111
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,720
they were changing things with their

1112
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,400
product that made it where they were

1113
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,079
learning really really heavily on

1114
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,680
something that wasn't actually happening

1115
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,440
so when we do see these things and we

1116
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,359
start the normalization we have the

1117
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,359
access to go reach out to them and have

1118
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,720
them look into those things and that

1119
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,240
benefits us obviously a researcher but

1120
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,800
that also helps them um you know if we

1121
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,400
find something they didn't notice it

1122
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,079
helps them make their stuff better as

1123
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,119
well

1124
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,800
cool awesome stuff yeah thanks

1125
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,760
further questions

1126
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,079
hello

1127
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,200
good then like thanks to speaker again

1128
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,320
thank you all

1129
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,320
thank you that's awesome
