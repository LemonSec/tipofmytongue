to anthony and

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,438
he is going to talk about cyber security

28
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,840
maturity in the pacific islands

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,720
integrating such services in a regional

30
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,680
framework thank you

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,119
thank you

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,040
thanks everyone for attending thanks

33

also

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,080
to first for the opportunity to speak

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,400
i'm very grateful i'd like to say just

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,560
at the outset that these are my

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,119
personal views and my personal work and

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,680
whilst monash university supports me

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,280
it's not their official

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,159
position so i need to make that clear

41
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,280
okay

42
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,759
a very brief introduction i have a lot

43
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,280
to talk to

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,720
and i want to use the time really

45
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,840
carefully

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,640
so my name is tony adams i'm a phd

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,880
candidate at monash university in

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,960
melbourne australia

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,119
with the department of software systems

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,000
and cyber security we do a lot of work

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,159
in the pacific islands region

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,240
which for people in australia

53
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,399
is part of our they're our neighbors our

54
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,240
next door community

55
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,960
so we do a lot of work uh building

56
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,799
capabilities

57
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,199
and supporting the pacific island

58
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,800
nations

59
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,160
which i'll talk to uh briefly

60
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,040
okay i'm going to talk about the problem

61
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,599
that my research is trying to solve

62
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,360
i'll introduce the pacific island

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,840
regions and talk quickly about why we

64
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,760
work in that area why it's important to

65
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,560
us

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,400
the scope of my work

67
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,640
i want to talk about an initial

68
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,319
conceptual model that we're putting

69
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,879
forward for a shared cyber security

70
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,959
framework across the pacific islands

71
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,080
region

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,640
i'll touch briefly on our first study

73
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,160
that we've completed

74
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,840
in this area which has been used to test

75
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,440
the framework

76
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,200
and then i'll show you some very brief

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,959
updates and talk about what we're doing

78
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,239
next

79
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,840
okay

80
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,280
the problem that we're talking about

81
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,959
here that we're trying to solve i'm

82
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,959
asking a couple of simple questions

83
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,480
what's the problem that we want to

84
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,879
address who's impacted

85
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,200
why should we be thinking about this

86
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,280
and how does this work contribute to a

87
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,480
solution

88
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,440
okay

89
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,040
i should say at the outset for all the

90
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,000
technical people here i'm sorry i'm

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,159
technically illiterate

92
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,920
so you'll just have to bear with me i

93
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,040
don't uh have a technology background

94
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,800
and you'll pick that up pretty quickly

95
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,480
the problem that we're trying to address

96
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,239
here is that in the pacific islands

97
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,080
region

98
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,319
most of the countries are on a very

99
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,959
early very early start of their journey

100
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,959
towards developing cyber security

101
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,159
self-reliance and maturity

102
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,080
there's organic

103
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,760
collaboration between

104
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,480
teams and between nations but they don't

105
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,920
have an organized integrated regional

106
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,239
approach to meeting their cyber security

107
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,799
needs whether it's people processes

108
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,519
technology there's nothing structured

109
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,360
in 2016 there was an attempt to create i

110
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,280
shouldn't say an attempt there was a

111
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,080
pacific regional search created

112
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,680
which didn't

113
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,720
last

114
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,360
for various reasons the pax cert is no

115
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,159
longer in existence so at the moment the

116
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,120
only collaboration between nations is

117
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,358
organic rather than

118
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,839
structured

119
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,560
who's impacted the pacific island

120
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,919
nations people who live and work there

121
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,199
governments

122
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,639
visitors residents companies etc but

123
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,880
people who also come to the region from

124
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,280
outside and for people in australia and

125
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,639
new zealand this is very important

126
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,160
everyone who does business in the

127
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,199
pacific island region is impacted by

128
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,240
this broad issue visitors tourists

129
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,880
partners etc

130
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,800
why should we address this

131
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,560
well in some of the early discussions

132
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,160
that we had with cyber security

133
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,520
practitioners in the pacific region

134
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,400
they called out two significant problems

135
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,440
they recognized that the lack of a

136
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,759
a regional collaborative approach to

137
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,400
cyber security maturity in the pacific

138
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,639
means that they're all vulnerable to

139
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,560
cyber attack

140
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,840
also

141
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,639
this

142
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,840
creates a handbrake on investment if you

143
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,400
like people are unwilling to invest in

144
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,039
the region or to set up business etc

145
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,639
because of that inherent business risk

146
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,160
those are the questions or the problems

147
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,000
that we're trying to address here

148
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,240
the work that we're doing here is going

149
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,479
to produce two things

150
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,039
firstly it'll produce a theoretical

151
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,759
model for how we can build a

152
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,639
collaborative shared cybersecurity

153
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,520
framework for low-income nations using

154
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,160
the pacific islands as a model

155
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,160
but a framework that we can apply to

156
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,400
other areas where we have

157
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,880
small low-income underdeveloped and

158
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,280
under-resourced countries

159
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,360
secondly we'll translate that into a

160
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,120
working toolkit

161
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,280
what we'd like to be able to do is say

162
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,960
to teams that are going into these

163
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,520
countries to do cmms or to do

164
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,160
interventions we like to offer a toolkit

165
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,400
which points to areas that they can

166
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,039
focus on to get the best results

167
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,039
where they can invest their resources in

168
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,960
the most appropriate places to get the

169
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,360
best return both for them and for the

170
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,960
country involved

171
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,160
okay the pacific island region

172
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,720
i'm looking at the 25 member countries

173
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,800
of the pacific islands forum that's a

174
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,039
convenient way for us to put some

175
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,600
boundary around this work

176
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,240
those nations are sorted into three

177
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,039
sub-regions micronesia melanesia and

178
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,560
polynesia

179
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,080
they each have

180
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,600
a lot in common but they have

181
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,319
differences both economically socially

182
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,080
and culturally

183
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,840
within those

184
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,800
within those 18 i say 25 the 18 member

185
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,160
nations

186
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,800
there are a group of particularly

187
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,520
disadvantaged

188
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,400
nations

189
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,759
and they have a status within the

190
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,800
pacific islands forum of sis

191
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,639
small island states

192
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,639
we'll touch on that

193
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,400
a little bit further on

194
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,000
so this is the area that we're working

195
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,919
in uh we're working with a number of

196
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,000
these countries around the initial study

197
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,240
and the initial model and we'll run some

198
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,160
tests and some case studies with some of

199
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,360
those

200
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,280
nations across each of those three

201
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,560
sub-regions

202
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,599
okay gosh i'll talk quickly now

203
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,039
this is the bit that's not quite so

204
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,720
interesting i'm going to run through the

205
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,880
research aim questions and objectives

206
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,520
lots of text no pictures sorry

207
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,360
okay research aims

208
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,120
what i want to do through this research

209
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,440
is i want to understand how low-income

210
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,120
nations

211
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,199
using the pacific islands region how

212
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,440
they can prioritize and align their

213
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,479
cyber security capabilities

214
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,319
within a multi-stakeholder regional

215
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,879
model in other words countries in the

216
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,599
pacific that are under resourced

217
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,840
at the beginning of their learning curve

218
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,759
with low maturity and low

219
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,479
capabilities how do they select the

220
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,160
services that they want to invest in and

221
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,840
develop for themselves

222
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,520
how do they choose the services that

223
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,319
they want to manage themselves

224
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,720
the services that they want to

225
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,479
put into a shared model across the

226
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,759
region the who do they want to

227
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,919
collaborate with and which services

228
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,319
don't matter to them and not a priority

229
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,840
okay so we want to understand those

230
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,440
the questions that i want to ask are

231
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,159
three how do the pacific island nations

232
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,919
choose the services that they want to

233
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,000
set up for themselves given their

234
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,479
circumstances in a multi-stakeholder

235
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,958
regional framework

236
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,279
how are those choices impacted by a set

237
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,360
of national drivers

238
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,360
national policies

239
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,200
national issues around investment

240
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,080
capability maturity etc

241
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,160
and how are those choices impacted by

242
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,320
the way that they engage within their

243
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,839
region

244
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,080
some of these nations um

245
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,920
have

246
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,399
kiribati might have 10 000 people across

247
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,399
a number of islands spread over hundreds

248
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,160
of kilometers

249
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,800
how do they engage with a region where

250
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,200
they have very poor infrastructure

251
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,480
that's the challenge that we've got to

252
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
try and solve

253
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,959
the objectives here okay we want to come

254
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,360
up with a conceptual model a theoretical

255
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
framework for how a group of small

256
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,680
low-income nations can collaborate

257
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,720
across a regional framework

258
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,560
we want to understand how those cert

259
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,959
services are distributed at the moment

260
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,360
across the asia-pacific region which is

261
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,519
a bit broader we want to look at how

262
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,200
countries in asia

263
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,440
are doing this and whether we can learn

264
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,920
from that

265
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,839
we want to look at the impacts of

266
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,480
national drivers policy drivers

267
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,200
government priorities etc and also

268
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,040
regional approach what does a regional

269
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
approach look like with regional

270
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,640
priorities and

271
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,399
etc

272
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,440
okay and the initial conceptual model

273
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,360
this is i like this it's a bit more

274
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,440
interesting the foundation for our

275
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,920
conceptual model is built on

276
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,760
three things

277
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,160
three pillars i call them the foreman

278
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,800
function so the a regional framework

279
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,399
will be built on

280
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,959
uh the policy priorities of the member

281
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,880
nations i find this really interesting

282
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,200
because it means that

283
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
a pacific island nation

284
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,000
uh will invest or participate in a

285
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,760
regional framework

286
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,399
based on its national priorities it'll

287
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,399
put its national interests first and

288
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,200
foremost it's looking for self-reliance

289
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,360
and it will invest in things that matter

290
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,120
most to it first

291
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,440
now the way it chooses to do that

292
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,519
will impact on what a regional framework

293
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,120
looks like

294
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,360
a country like the fiji

295
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,320
which is relatively well off

296
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,160
will inve will take a different approach

297
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,240
to a regional engagement to

298
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,640
kiribati or palau

299
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,320
the federated states of micronesia

300
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,079
domestic priorities will override the

301
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,000
regional priorities

302
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,480
so the countries will will be involved

303
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,560
in a regional framework with their own

304
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,880
interests first and then the regional

305
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,880
interests will always come second

306
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,320
because they just don't have the

307
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,160
resources to do otherwise

308
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
but they will they'll collaborate on

309
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,880
issues of shared interest

310
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,959
so the countries recognize they don't

311
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,720
have the resources to do everything

312
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,839
themselves

313
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,360
they'll do the things that are most

314
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,839
important for themselves

315
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,360
and then they'll work with regional

316
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,360
partners on the issues where they have

317
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,959
shared interests that's a really

318
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,560
important thing

319
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,959
previously we've seen with interventions

320
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,200
etc that have not worked as well as we'd

321
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,240
like

322
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,880
that we we put a

323
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,880
one-size-fits-all approach and we say

324
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,120
we're going to put this solution in

325
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,600
place for these countries everyone will

326
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,519
have it the same

327
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,120
hasn't worked

328
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,560
the countries will look for their own

329
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,560
interests first and then they'll share

330
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,399
and collaborate with things where they

331
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,240
have shared interests

332
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,360
okay

333
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,959
i've touched on this

334
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,880
i'll skip past this

335
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,760
slide

336
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,600
all right i'll talk quickly

337
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,760
the conceptual model the foundations are

338
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,480
will have a network of affiliated

339
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,760
independent national certs

340
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,440
the capabilities of those searches will

341
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,839
be aligned to their national interests

342
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,360
first and foremost and they'll

343
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,040
collaborate on other interests where

344
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,920
they have

345
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,880
shared

346
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,399
interests

347
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,800
there's a role for external partners

348
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,639
ngos etc universities and so on to

349
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,440
provide support that targets

350
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
the national priorities

351
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,680
so a country like

352
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,639
tonga

353
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,040
will look for material support to invest

354
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,440
in a particular issue

355
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,920
that meets its domestic priorities and

356
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,839
there's a role for

357
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,560
first itu or for other groups to support

358
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,800
that

359
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,839
that support shouldn't just be given

360
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:04,959
because

361
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,839
we want to be altruistic

362
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,760
the support should be given based on

363
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,480
sound solid planning and internal

364
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,920
governance

365
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,360
what's really important to me is that

366
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,959
those four points

367
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,399
came from pacific island practitioners

368
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,560
so pacific island practitioners came to

369
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,639
me in fact a gentleman in kiribati and

370
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,839
said don't just give us money

371
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,480
because we've seen this in the past what

372
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,279
we need is money that helps us deliver

373
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,040
particular things

374
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,360
based on solid planning and solid

375
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,279
governance

376
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,160
which

377
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,320
to me is really really interesting

378
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,040
okay the original the initial conceptual

379
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,399
model here

380
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,120
that i'm putting forward has three key

381
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,320
themes

382
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,959
what it says is that countries will

383
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,199
participate in a regional framework

384
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,800
they'll work together

385
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,079
based on

386
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,839
a set of national

387
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,959
drivers

388
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,040
national issues that matter

389
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,279
regional issues that matter

390
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,199
and global issues

391
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,360
the global issues we see tend to set

392
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,000
best practice

393
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,880
you must have a functioning judiciary

394
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,800
you must have

395
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,079
a

396
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,399
stable society these global best

397
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,160
practices

398
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,160
the areas that i'm focusing on over the

399
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,839
next couple of years are around those

400
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,800
regional and national drivers because

401
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,639
they're the ones where you get slight

402
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,199
differences between countries in those

403
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,079
sub-regions and countries themselves

404
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,040
they have with their different

405
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,360
priorities

406
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,680
okay

407
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,639
when i look at the three themes the

408
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,519
national regional and global issues

409
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,120
they're linked together you'll see this

410
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,480
on the next slide by a couple of

411
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,920
enablers

412
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,839
and we'll talk through those

413
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,760
okay

414
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,399
the picture up on here is the initial

415
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,480
model that i'm putting forward the three

416
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,839
circles i won't go through all the

417
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,320
details the three circles represent the

418
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,360
three sets of influences

419
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,199
the national from the bottom right the

420
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,440
national drivers through the regional

421
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,360
engagement and to the global best

422
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,279
practices at the top

423
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,279
the little overlap areas are the

424
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,519
enablers if i look at national

425
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,279
governance

426
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,120
what that tells me is that's a set of

427
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,000
issues that link the way that a national

428
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,480
government chooses to engage with global

429
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,000
best practices

430
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,240
the way that the national governance

431
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,880
issues how closely a national cert is

432
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,240
aligned to

433
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,000
the federal government

434
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,399
practices and funding and so on

435
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,560
those governance issues impact how it

436
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,440
chooses to adopt best practices versus

437
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,199
how it chooses to work by itself

438
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,320
the second enabler aligned certs

439
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,120
that tells me

440
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,040
that represents a group of certs that

441
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
work in a regional environment that

442
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,519
engage regionally with global best

443
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,880
practices

444
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,880
so certs working within the pacific

445
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,800
islands region

446
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,880
will work with global best practices in

447
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,639
a certain way that they'll work out

448
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,880
themselves that's what the aligned certs

449
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,160
enabler is

450
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,079
the one that sits at the heart of my

451
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,079
research for the next few years is the

452
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,120
one in red which is the services

453
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,199
and this is where i'm looking at what

454
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,240
are the national influences

455
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,560
whether they're internal architecture

456
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,240
internal governance

457
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,079
critical infrastructure

458
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,000
and capability maturity

459
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,839
how do they impact the way that a

460
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,399
government engages with the region

461
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,399
and chooses the services that it wants

462
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,079
to deliver

463
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,920
the services that kiribati will choose

464
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,199
to deliver

465
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,880
will be different to the services that

466
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,199
tonga or papua new guinea

467
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,759
will choose to deliver why because those

468
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,759
national drivers are different they're

469
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,600
in different places with their critical

470
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,279
infrastructure ownership

471
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,720
they're in different places with their

472
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,199
capability maturity

473
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,800
and they're able to engage with that

474
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,119
regional framework in different ways

475
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,520
the bid at the center the cert services

476
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,880
sits at the heart

477
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,000
the two questions that i'm answering

478
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,839
how do those regional how does the

479
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,599
regional engagement

480
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,640
impact the way that certs operate

481
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,720
in a collaborative framework

482
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,359
and how do the certs national drivers

483
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,199
impact the way that it engages

484
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,480
nationally

485
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,039
regionally

486
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,600
okay i'm not going to talk through all

487
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,760
the intricate details of this but what i

488
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,520
want to say here is that this is the

489
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,520
theoretical framework that sits behind

490
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,440
the model

491
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,039
i mentioned at the start that i'm not a

492
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,960
technologist i don't pretend to be

493
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,799
what i'm talking about here is using an

494
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,640
activity theory

495
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,919
um to model the way that a cert

496
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,559
operates within a regional environment

497
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,840
by looking at

498
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,360
um the national governments the cert

499
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,440
services the global best practices the

500
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,840
regional framework the national drivers

501
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,160
those six points on that triangle

502
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,720
represent six influences that all

503
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,480
collaborate in a multi-dimensional

504
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,880
multi-layered approach that we capture

505
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,520
using activity theory specifically i'm

506
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,360
going to be using cultural historical

507
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,480
activity theory which comes out of the

508
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,200
1920s psycholog psychology work that was

509
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,960
put forward by a russian chap called

510
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,400
vygotsky

511
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,799
and it sits it puts forward a number of

512
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,120
propositions about how we create

513
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,840
knowledge and how we learn

514
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,160
we don't just create knowledge and learn

515
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,840
things by by reading a book

516
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,039
the book helps us but what we learn is

517
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,640
influenced by

518
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,160
the cultural background that we come

519
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,440
from

520
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,200
what's important to us the rules that

521
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,240
society put on us etc

522
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,559
all of this matters because all of those

523
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,640
six points work together in this

524
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,120
multi-dimensional framework

525
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,840
to decide or to demonstrate how the

526
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,480
national cert will choose to operate and

527
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,640
put forward services based on all of

528
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,240
these other issues that we've spoken

529
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,559
about

530
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,840
so the

531
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,520
on the model there i've got listed a

532
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,760
couple of contradictions

533
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,840
contradictions here are not problems

534
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,880
contradictions here are opportunities to

535
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,840
expand and to change the model

536
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,919
so part of the work here this is based

537
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,400
on a dialectic materialist ontology

538
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
which is put forward by marx and hegel

539
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,640
what it means is that all of these

540
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,400
issues are constantly in tension

541
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,240
and it means that if we look at those

542
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,640
issues that are in tension we can fi

543
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,280
under tension we can find opportunities

544
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,160
for

545
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,520
improvement and growth

546
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,000
and that's the objective here how do the

547
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,320
bottom left-hand triangle point there

548
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,799
how do those national drivers impact the

549
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,360
cert services there's a point of tension

550
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,280
there because different countries do it

551
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,520
differently

552
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,200
how does the regional framework that

553
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,960
regional community impact the search

554
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,200
services there's a point of of

555
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,600
contradiction there a point of tension

556
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
that we can focus on and understand

557
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,600
better

558
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,080
if we do that across different countries

559
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,159
we get this uh model where we have

560
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,960
different organizations overlapping

561
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,200
the bit in the middle the circles in the

562
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,720
middle are the really interesting part

563
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,039
because that's the shared model

564
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,559
across the region

565
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,760
each country represented by

566
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,840
the interactive triangle

567
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,919
where they overlap that's the area of

568
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,360
shared interest

569
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,440
shared services they're the search

570
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,760
services they choose to collaborate on

571
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,679
versus the services that they choose not

572
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,120
to

573
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,880
so the model that i'm putting forward

574
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,200
looks at all of these components how

575
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,960
they interact how they overlap

576
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,240
the end objective here

577
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,240
is that by understanding how each of

578
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,440
these

579
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,240
small countries works and provides

580
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,799
how they feed into this model

581
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,600
we can understand which areas when they

582
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,320
change when they're under tension

583
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,840
if we can change those through

584
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,600
intervention or through investment or

585
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,000
whatever we change the bit in the middle

586
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,039
the shared collaborative space

587
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,919
if we change the way that samoa chooses

588
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,520
to invest in

589
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,159
threat detection

590
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,840
then we change the way that it

591
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,919
collaborates across the region in the

592
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,760
middle there because it brings a

593
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,520
different set of knowledge and a

594
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,440
different set of expectations and

595
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,159
priorities and skill set maturity etc

596
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,360
okay

597
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,720
i'm nearly done

598
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,880
the first study we did over the last six

599
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,919
months

600
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,320
was to test this initial model and to

601
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,559
see you know rather than just being

602
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,760
academic does it kind of make sense

603
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,039
like does it

604
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,039
does it resonate so we've spoken to a

605
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,720
number of people

606
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,640
from 10 participations from really from

607
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,280
around the world to say does this kind

608
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,918
of work

609
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,240
mostly it does

610
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,760
there are some bits that we've we're

611
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,679
stepping away from and there are some

612
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,520
bits that will focus on

613
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,360
with more intensity some bits that

614
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,840
matter more

615
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,919
we know that

616
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,840
all of these countries are interested in

617
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,919
key services threat detection incident

618
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,159
response forensic analysis advisory

619
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,400
service community awareness was a really

620
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,320
interesting one all of them see

621
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,159
themselves as having a role to play in

622
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,640
building community awareness

623
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,720
the key themes that these countries all

624
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,080
put forward

625
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,720
trust is an enabler of success

626
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,840
they want to focus on people not

627
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,520
technology national certs have a role in

628
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,559
raising community awareness

629
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,240
national certs they want to support

630
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,039
national priorities and areas of shared

631
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,640
regional interest

632
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,039
and partners have a role in helping to

633
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,840
build cyber resilience across the region

634
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,440
these are the key themes that the

635
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,360
participants of the first study put

636
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,280
forward so what does that mean for the

637
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,799
model

638
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,840
when we update this

639
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,919
i'm looking at the highlighted bits

640
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:22,880
because

641
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,559
that's the really interesting part for

642
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,720
the next couple of years the highlighted

643
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,039
bits tell us that at a global level

644
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,440
everyone's interested in international

645
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,960
norms

646
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,720
and we heard wendy talk this morning

647
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,960
about international norms

648
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,080
as being

649
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,480
the ex they set standards of behavior or

650
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,720
interaction that we expect

651
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,799
what this model tells us and the

652
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,480
theoretical background is that norms are

653
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,080
not fixed

654
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,880
norms represent a point in time

655
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,880
and they can be expected to change over

656
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,480
time

657
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,279
so

658
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,440
i want to explore that a little bit more

659
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,360
at a regional level everyone was

660
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,120
interested in how they integrate with

661
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,919
other

662
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,200
teams

663
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,480
whether we can have structured

664
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,559
integration or organic integration

665
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,480
etcetera

666
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,640
so we'll focus on that more

667
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,559
at the national level what was really

668
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,159
really interesting was capability

669
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,279
maturity

670
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,360
all of the participate participants are

671
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
focused on capability maturity and

672
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,840
building the core capabilities

673
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,600
we don't have an answer about how to do

674
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,840
that but it's an area that all of these

675
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,000
pacific island nations are looking for

676
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,279
support to do and by extension i expect

677
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,279
that other low-income nations in other

678
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,120
areas around the world will have a

679
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,840
similar view

680
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,960
finally what this means is that my first

681
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,600
question how do the the pacific island

682
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,679
nations choose the cert services that

683
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,360
they want to support

684
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,799
versus the services they're not

685
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:49,919
interested in

686
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,919
versus the services they want to share

687
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,000
across the region

688
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,960
is

689
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,720
remains relevant and will focus on that

690
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,919
the question around national drivers

691
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,520
remains relevant

692
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,360
all of the participants talked about

693
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,840
that that mattered to them

694
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,440
the third question around how they

695
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,760
engage regionally and how that impacts

696
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,279
the services

697
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,760
wasn't quite so interesting to them

698
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,440
so we'll keep that in the study but it's

699
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,520
not an area that we'll focus on i'm just

700
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,640
not convinced

701
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,919
there's the appetite for that

702
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,559
the way that we're doing this final

703
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,600
slide

704
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,000
we've built the initial conceptual model

705
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,520
through looking at previous research

706
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,480
around the world previous literature etc

707
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,559
we've completed this first study just to

708
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,279
validate it see if it makes sense

709
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,600
the next step which we're starting

710
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
now and will run over the next six

711
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,000
months to two years will be a series of

712
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,360
case studies with pacific island nations

713
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,440
i mentioned earlier those three regions

714
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,080
and the the small island states

715
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,919
will be working with a nation from each

716
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,840
of those three island are those three

717
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,559
regional areas polynesia micronesia

718
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,480
melanesia

719
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,880
but we'll also work with one nation from

720
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,559
that sis group

721
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,799
these are the particularly disadvantaged

722
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,039
nations who will have their own really

723
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,000
unique perspective

724
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,919
another thing that wendy said this

725
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,600
morning resonated with me and this was

726
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,799
this idea that we have like a a social

727
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,880
contract contract

728
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,640
when we're dealing with these

729
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,520
really poor countries that's paramount

730
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,400
abs absolutely important

731
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,159
so that's where we are now we've put

732
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,480
forward the initial conceptual model

733
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,400
we think that there's a lot of

734
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,559
opportunity to identify areas for

735
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,679
investment for focused intervention

736
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,159
rather than a vanilla approach to all

737
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,360
nations

738
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,360
this model will help us see for each

739
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,840
nation what matters to them and where we

740
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,000
should be focusing and how that fits

741
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,159
together into a regional framework that

742
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,880
makes sense

743
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,799
i'll skip past this slide there's too

744
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,679
much detail and i'm out of time

745
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,240
so finally once again i'm tony adams

746
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,480
from monash university in melbourne

747
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,679
australia

748
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,360
thanks for your time thanks for so many

749
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,960
people attending way more than i

750
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,760
expected and i'm very grateful thank you

751
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,559
thank you tony

752
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,799
so

753
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,840
do you have any questions to

754
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,080
uh for tom

755
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,600
yes please

756
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,158
go ahead

757
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,720
it's working

758
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,840
yeah uh ted norman from

759
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,880
cccs um

760
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,559
as you're bringing up wendy i'm thinking

761
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,159
the same thing as i'm going through this

762
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,799
but how applicable is this to some of

763
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,158
the things she was bringing up about

764
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,520
businesses organizations that are

765
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,279
are also poor

766
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,240
um

767
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,960
the federations of healthcare or other

768
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,559
types of things which are similar to the

769
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,679
groupings that you've done with

770
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:56,960
countries

771
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,399
do you contemplate the same thing when

772
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,159
you're listening to a speech

773
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,600
or in some of the research that you're

774
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,520
doing yeah

775
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,200
i was really impressed by what wendy

776
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
said this morning

777
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,679
when i came here i was thinking about

778
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,840
applying the model to

779
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,200
countries

780
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,799
with partners being you know vendors or

781
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,840
universities or etc

782
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,600
but over the last couple of hours and in

783
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,960
answer to your question i'm also

784
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,559
thinking about applying the model to

785
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,320
partners themselves and our partner

786
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,679
could be

787
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,480
a network of providers

788
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,240
my focus is on the countries but a

789
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,200
network of of service providers working

790
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,120
together in a region that's really

791
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,520
interesting and i i absolutely think

792
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,480
that i would

793
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,320
i should be applying this sort of

794
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,440
thinking in that sense so

795
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,000
yes the answer is yes

796
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,880
coming

797
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,399
coming from the national cesar

798
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,279
perspective i mean we have to support

799
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,200
a lot of those kind of organizations in

800
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
a country and yeah we're also thinking

801
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,960
of you know

802
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,240
you know how do we support other

803
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,399
countries so yeah how do you under how

804
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,240
do you identify what they actually want

805
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,399
or and what's going to add value like

806
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,600
rather than just

807
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,880
throwing your money and time at

808
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,880
everything what are the key things that

809
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,360
they need that you can add most value to

810
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,039
that's what i'm interested in and where

811
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,240
can we find

812
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,679
the progress in your research

813
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,120
i don't want to sound like i'm selling

814
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,520
myself but

815
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,080
i have some um an init an initial paper

816
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,320
that i'm happy to share um

817
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,320
i should make it available i i don't

818
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,559
know how but we'll find a way okay

819
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,440
thanks happy to share it

820
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,679
new zealand um thanks for the talk and

821
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,679
your interest in the pacific um i'm sure

822
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,679
you're aware that there's the existing

823
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,120
pixon

824
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,760
network which is made up of pacific

825
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,039
island nations including australia and

826
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,600
new zealand yeah um so i'm just sort of

827
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,679
curious as to what you think

828
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,080
you could add to that which is a

829
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,640
a good collaboration of pacific nations

830
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,080
at the moment where we're sharing

831
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,480
knowledge and information and how this

832
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,880
would add to that so what it's a really

833
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,039
good question and i've spoken

834
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,919
with adley and with clay as well um

835
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,760
what i'm trying to do is put a

836
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,000
theoretical framework around this so the

837
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,320
work that paxon's already doing and that

838
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,240
engagement

839
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,399
i want to put structure around that and

840
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,960
prove that it makes sense

841
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,200
so that

842
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,600
certain new zealand in particular

843
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,200
does brilliant work partnering with

844
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,279
pacific island nations

845
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,159
but i want to understand and explore

846
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,600
what they do

847
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,960
and

848
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,880
put some structure around that so that

849
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,720
you can step back and go yeah that's the

850
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,039
model and that's what we do and we can

851
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,000
see that this changes and etc so i want

852
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,399
to put some uh structure around it and

853
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,159
offer that then as a model

854
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,600
for other parts of the world that have

855
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,399
got a similar issue cool let's let's

856
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,200
stay in touch yeah definitely

857
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,240
thank you

858
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,440
it's a very interesting uh investigation

859
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,600
that that you are running

860
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,880
um

861
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,200
and i think that a framework for

862
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,440
everybody for all the islands

863
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,240
and with different techniques it should

864
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,960
not be so easy to

865
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,159
to design but i think that they will be

866
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,200
benefit with with a framework to follow

867
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,880
and it's very important to talk uh to

868
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,519
have the same languages at least and set

869
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,840
a line basis to in order to exchange

870
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,240
information and to collaborate otherwise

871
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,360
everybody is doing whatever and

872
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,200
it's hard to do

873
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,919
okay thank you and please uh

874
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:58,799
