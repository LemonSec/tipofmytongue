21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,360

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,040
saturday the chief technology officer

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,200
from germany from st paris brings me up

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,520

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,439
if i don't answer the phone he might

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,439
screw me up next week if i answer the

33
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,119
phone that might be my weekend i'm going

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,520
to screw up i answered the phone

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,960
it was actually

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,600
a partner of ours has contacted them

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,119
it's a customer

38
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,439
not of ours we've never heard of him and

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,320
actually on friday they were attacked

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,799
their active directory was destroyed

41
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,040
it's completely taken down

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,840
every backup of the active directory on

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,000
premise

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,520
destructed

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,880
how do you go about

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,320
this is a threat

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,560
which is actual from which is actual

48
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,360
today

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,200
when we have a look at disaster recovery

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,079
plans normally they were for physical

51
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,920
events that are happening volcanoes

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,119
earthquakes

53
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,280
then they moved into terrorism

54
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,399
today

55
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,360
disaster recovery should be covering

56
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,680
cyber weaponization

57
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,360
if your iad goes down your

58
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,719
infrastructure

59
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,560
is probably going to be

60
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,679
a cyber attack mere shipping

61
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,120
the olympic uh the olympic games 2018

62
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,120
all signs it's coming

63
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,200
and it's coming faster than we want my

64
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,040
name is callum phil solutions architect

65
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,360
by sam perez really pleased to be here

66
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,280
we're also downstairs if i don't get any

67
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,000
time ransomware can kind of suck us in

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,560
and i could hit the end of the time i'm

69
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,160
downstairs i'm happy to take on any

70
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,760
discussion any questions or answers give

71
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,040
you a demo of our products how they're

72
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,800
working no problems

73
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,560
protecting the digital enterprise what

74
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,319
does that mean for you

75
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,280
the risk of the enterprise they're

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,080
changing even more i can remember back

77
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,840
when i was doing client management we

78
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,120
were talking about bring your own

79
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,519
devices hey how cool i can bring my

80
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,959
tablet to work

81
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,720
who's talking about bringing a tablet to

82
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,640
work today who's talking about going to

83
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,160
work we all want to work from home now

84
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,000
that's what the user is expecting isn't

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,680
it or it's not maybe not what they're

86
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,080
spending expecting they want two days in

87
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,360
the office maybe three days at home

88
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,040
maybe the other way around but it's

89
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,120
changing again right the boundaries are

90
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,360
changing where are our users where do we

91
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,959
need to concentrate our efforts to

92
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,480
protect

93
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,640
then we have cloud applications wow

94
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,640
cloud using someone else's computer

95
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,720
great one okay but these are things

96
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,159
we've all got to think about how are we

97
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,760
going to authenticate to cloud

98
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,000
applications that have been used by our

99
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,239
by our users who might be just about

100
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,040
anywhere in the whole world now

101
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,840
scattered hybrid

102
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
identities everyone many organizations

103
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,840
got an active directory some people

104
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,640
might be using federation services octa

105
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,120
as a federation service some people

106
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,120
definitely going to be moving into azure

107
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,040
active directory some of you might have

108
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,200
said okay microsoft go away let's have a

109
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
look at google aw um let's have a look

110
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,680
at google and let's have a look at aws

111
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,680
there's just so many places where these

112
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,920
identities can exist from an

113
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,159
administrator perspective

114
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,480
we don't want identities being scattered

115
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,080
everywhere when someone leaves the

116
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,920
company how many services have you got

117
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,680
to check up before the identity of this

118
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,519
person who's now left the company is

119
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,200
actually being

120
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,080
completely deleted

121
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,879
and we've got ransomware attacks

122
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,798
it gets a little murky when we start

123
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,358
talking about cyber espionage it's not

124
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,519
just your normal teams your county teams

125
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,520
or whatever without working out there

126
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,120
we've also got state actors

127
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,680
state actors definitely using all these

128
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,240
ransomware malware denial attacks

129
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,000
whatever where attacks there's just so

130
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,080
many of them and it's not just not

131
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,560
certain hacker groups it's state actors

132
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
what does this mean

133
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,400
you know your active directory by many

134
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,080
organizations what's the active

135
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,240
directory that's the server sitting in

136
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,560
the corner collecting the dust nobody

137
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,720
knows what it's doing it's just it's a

138
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
server it's like the air that we breathe

139
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,400
it's like the food that we drink that we

140
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,440
eat the

141
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,880
the liquors that we drink it's just

142
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,080
something we've always done you know

143
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,000
active director is just there it's just

144
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,160
always been there man i mean think about

145
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,840
it 22 years of active directory 22 years

146
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,160
a product of microsoft has managed and

147
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,919
who would have thought that today year

148
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,919
2022 we're still talking about a

149
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,919
technology that was designed 22 years

150
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,360
ago

151
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,280
and let's just stay on this type of

152
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,880
let's just stay on this train of thought

153
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,280
right who would have thought

154
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,199
which developers who were developing

155
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,600
active directory 22 years ago

156
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,080
which one of them had the insights today

157
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,759
the threats that the

158
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,919
capabilities and everything that could

159
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,400
happen to an active directory fact is

160
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
nobody who was developing active

161
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,919
directory back then

162
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,759
could have known about the risk that

163
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,800
we're gonna be under today

164
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,880
and i think if anyone says well i don't

165
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,720
want to listen to calum but i want the

166
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,160
takeaways i'll tell you what the

167
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,160
takeaway is for today your active

168
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,759
directory is not as protected as you

169
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,120
think it is

170
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,440
it's just too damn easy to take the

171
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,600
whole infrastructure down

172
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,120
you don't believe me

173
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,120
well i look forward to talking about

174
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,160
mask

175
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,479
very shortly

176
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,080
it's not just the security companies

177
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,240
talking about your identities now by the

178
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,160
way it seems to be every security

179
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,400
company is now talking about identity as

180
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,000
if it's something new no it's not we

181
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,680
just talked about active directory has

182
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,880
been around for 22 years

183
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,520
microsoft says identity is the new

184
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,680
control plane

185
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,639
you have to concentrate on your identity

186
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,360
then when we have a look at analysts

187
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,440
identity is central to providing

188
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,840
appropriate accurate and secure access

189
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,000
to data services and systems that's from

190
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,039
gartner

191
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,639
and foster they're saying something

192
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,080
pretty similar as well

193
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
identity is a core building block of a

194
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,400
robust zero trust security ecosystem and

195
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,319
infrastructure

196
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,599
damn buzzword bingo said it zero trust

197
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,840
damn i wanted to avoid that believe me

198
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,199
i'm gonna try and avoid all this

199
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,720
password bingo

200
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,840
let's move

201
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,360
on hybrid what does hybrid mean

202
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,960
let's do a little reverse who's got an

203
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,720
active directory in our organization

204
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,080
just put your hands up quickly there's

205
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,759
no prizes i've got all the prizes on the

206
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,599
stand stand one right okay that was a

207
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,720
lot of hands

208
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,680
who's putting a hand up who's got a zoo

209
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,639
active directory

210
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,199
great one

211
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,800
who hasn't got a clue what idea and

212
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
other active director is

213
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,240
he probably might be in the wrong room

214
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,479
oh no hands okay great one i love it

215
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,880
love it so hybrid we have what we're

216
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
seeing is your active directory is still

217
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,919
the central point of your identities

218
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,000
when identities get created it's

219
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,120
probably going to be in your active

220
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,880
directory they might think it might come

221
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,000
from some human resources tool but

222
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,280
they're being pumped into active

223
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,520
directory

224
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,680
now we're saying no microsoft opened up

225
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,520
a whole new kind of worms

226
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,960
and we're moving into the cloud with the

227
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,199
identities

228
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,759
but what's at the center what's at the

229
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,680
center of your infrastructure it's your

230
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,720
active directory

231
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,919
if your active directory goes down

232
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,479
you've got a kind of a backup password

233
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,599
directory

234
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,080
but it's not a replacement for active

235
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,199
directory

236
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,720
and we see

237
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,639
very few companies

238
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,639
who have moved 100

239
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,599
into azure active directory

240
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,759
what does that mean though active

241
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,120
directory is central to hybrid identity

242
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,039
it doesn't matter what sort of services

243
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,719
you've used we've been talking about our

244
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,559
users scattered around all around the

245
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,760
globe

246
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,440
might be you want to use some other

247
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,919
services octagee suite they might be

248
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,519
they're going to go to azure active

249
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,440
directory pick up the identities from

250
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,399
this

251
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,800
but your users they want to use other

252
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,839
services box salesforce aws office drive

253
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,360
365.

254
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,120
there's so many compelling reasons why

255
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,600
your organization must be thinking about

256
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,000
the move into using azure active

257
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,320
directory

258
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
but think about one of the sentences i

259
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,760
said at the start

260
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,480
by lots of organizations the active

261
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,160
directory server

262
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,720
is the server sitting in the corner

263
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,320
collecting dust

264
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,240
and that's unfortunately where we are

265
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,120
today so this server collecting dust has

266
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,519
been even more important today because

267
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,000
it's actually giving you identities

268
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,320
to azure active directory

269
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,480
it is the center one block if you play

270
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,000
with lego that's your first block

271
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
active directory is a cyber crime target

272
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,640
if any of you guys really want to earn

273
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,320
some real money maybe we've picked the

274
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,480
wrong job maybe we should be in it but

275
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,160
maybe we should have been working as an

276
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,880
attacker as a ransomware attacker have

277
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,120
you seen some of the amounts that these

278
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,880
ransomware attackers the narwhal

279
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,279
attackers what they're asking for

280
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,959
700 750 bitcoin i'll take it yeah way

281
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,920
better sign where does i know for this

282
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,360
two and a half million

283
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,079
rob sign up

284
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,720
there's just so many cyber attacks are

285
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,120
happening it's getting quite hard to

286
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,600
track it all down and what's being um

287
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,519
infiltrated

288
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,880
so much money

289
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,079
but what i'd like to point out here

290
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,880
every 11 seconds

291
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,440
an attack is happening so in the 11

292
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,880
seconds that i've been walking up and

293
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,320
down here now just showing this one

294
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,399
screen some somebody might have just

295
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,959
earned 750 bitcoins

296
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,640
and there's me working for my money on

297
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,399
the stage talking to you guys well won't

298
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,560
be

299
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,640
ad is in the attacker in the attacker's

300
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,079
core says

301
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,600
doesn't matter what sort of attacks

302
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,880
we're looking at

303
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,519
the ad is somehow involved the ad must

304
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,279
be involved because it doesn't matter if

305
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,120
you want to infiltrate data what do you

306
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,959
need an account you need an account that

307
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,800
has access to the data

308
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,360
what a better way to find the account

309
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,200
needed to access the data than your

310
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,680
active directory why are they saying

311
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,480
it's the king's tasty or kingdom because

312
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,600
the active directory is one massive

313
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,399
information of data if i want to know

314
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,000
about permissions i want to find out

315
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,519
about identities which ones are worth

316
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,279
hacking i'm just going to

317
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,920
use the active directory so here we can

318
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,399
see several attacks where the active

319
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,600
directory is being used in attack

320
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,079
maybe even left in a

321
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,720
unusable state when the attackers were

322
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,720
finished

323
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,040
and over here cassia

324
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,120
huffingham zero logon print nightmare

325
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,160
god the list goes on

326
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,600
active directory solarwinds hafnium the

327
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,760
solar winds wow what a massive attack

328
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,000
right

329
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,000
in fact the

330
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,920
solar winds attack

331
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,760
was quite unique

332
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,920
normally what we see is the bad actors

333
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,519
they're coming from the internet and

334
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,480
getting onto your local on-premise

335
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,480
with solarwinds the supply retainer

336
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
track it was a reverse attack to

337
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,959
everything we had already known before

338
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,880
because of the software of solarwinds

339
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,120
the attackers got onto the active

340
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,440
directory on premise

341
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,040
from the on premise

342
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,600
they moved into the cloud

343
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,200
many of you have probably heard about a

344
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,880
golden ticket attack

345
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,600
this is the first time we saw the golden

346
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,519
salmon attack

347
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,760
the golden samuel attack the attackers

348
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,360
they could give themselves a ticket

349
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,639
doesn't matter where they are in the

350
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,600
world every federated service

351
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,839
they could have got access to

352
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,839
it's the first time we've seen it

353
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,480
hafnium zero day exploits they're being

354
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,320
used quite a lot by the way the solar

355
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
winds we're expecting is the russians

356
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,000
it's no one's putting their hand up at

357
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,639
the end and hafnium the zero day

358
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,560
exploits we exchange servers being

359
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,680
misused

360
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,680
permissions again being gained

361
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,600
this is expected to come from the china

362
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,480
side

363
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,320
as i said it's based up it's not just

364
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,440
your normal hacker groups your

365
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
well-known hacking groups

366
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,880
state aided hacking

367
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
it doesn't matter which account uh or

368
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,360
which attacks we talk about now

369
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,320
the active directory played a very big

370
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,680
part in these attacks

371
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,279
does anyone recognize this picture

372
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,680
if somebody does recognize it someone's

373
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,440
got their hand up oh yeah

374
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,079
i do hope it was just from maybe a bit

375
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,760
of news or something or a picture on

376
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,920
twitter i hope it wasn't something you

377
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,160
had to turn on your laptop for and you

378
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,480
got greeted by this picture

379
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,279
i'm on petra

380
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,720
non-petra a very big company got hit by

381
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,680
this

382
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,519
a very big company

383
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,600
let's talk about the company

384
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,839
before i start talking about maersk may

385
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:52,560
i

386
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,440
may i really stress out at this stage

387
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,920
i am very thankful to ms for the

388
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,240
openness about how they were attacked

389
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,680
what happened

390
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,399
why

391
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,560
because we can all learn from it other

392
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,880
organizations can learn about well how

393
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,800
should we have done things in fact andy

394
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,279
powell has even done an hour interview

395
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,920
on spotify talking about the mistakes

396
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,600
that mayors made

397
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,040
if they could go back in time and

398
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,399
correct something what would they

399
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,279
correct

400
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,160
i think this is a very valuable talk

401
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,279
that he gave

402
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,920
to give you insight about the mistakes

403
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,040
of other con

404
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,279
companies

405
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,199
and it's very interesting at maisline

406
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,639
what happened

407
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,399
this is the world's biggest shipping

408
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,399
company

409
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,000
however

410
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,560
within seven minutes

411
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,399
146 domain controllers

412
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,800
wiped out

413
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
there was actually only one domain

414
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,120
controller left

415
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,920
but

416
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,079
it was in a country that just had a

417
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:56,959
power

418
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,720
disruption that was the reason why it

419
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,199
was turned off

420
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,040
so mere shipping they lost 146 domain

421
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,880
controllers everything is encrypted to

422
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,399
get anything on that server it was

423
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,320
unusable in this state if you just went

424
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,000
and turned on you get a blue screen

425
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,720
that's unusable nothing is exist anymore

426
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,040
may shipping had to get domain

427
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,720
controllers up and running why do we

428
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,920
need the domain controllers up and

429
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,839
running well every service that's

430
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,000
connected to your domain controllers is

431
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,639
not usable until your active directory

432
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,800
is working

433
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,120
so when you get hit by ransomware denial

434
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,600
where whatever it's called

435
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,959
you're going to be very concentrating

436
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,320
getting your active directory up and

437
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,440
running

438
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,600
without active directory

439
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,320
hardly nothing works even at mere

440
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,440
shipping

441
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,279
they've got their big lorries to the to

442
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,480
the ports

443
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,639
the doors were even controlled by active

444
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,160
directory they had to type in a number

445
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,839
press a button and it's checking all the

446
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,800
information didn't work anymore so no no

447
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,320
laws coming in no lawyers coming out and

448
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,920
can't open the doors

449
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,399
they resulted to using pencils the

450
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,240
world's biggest shipping companies they

451
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
had no idea what's in the containers

452
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,040
because that's all digital probably in

453
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,199
some excel sheet somewhere right

454
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,160
you can't use it anymore

455
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,680
seven minutes 146 domain controllers

456
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,959
gone

457
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,320
55 000 extra servers devices

458
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,360
corn

459
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,279
critical applications all gone

460
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,279
imagine just for

461
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,759
just for 10 seconds

462
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,839
monday you go to work nine o'clock

463
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,240
management's all outside

464
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,240
hair on fire

465
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,680
if there's a table there there's some

466
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,959
manager he's going to be banging his

467
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,920
fist when we come in online again

468
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,680
you get the information aed is

469
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,320
compromised

470
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,959
nothing's available

471
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,800
how do you recover

472
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,639
can you recover

473
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,920
what questions have you got to ask

474
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,440
yourself to be able to recover from such

475
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,199
a scenario

476
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,119
once again

477
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,520
i am very thankful for mesline for the

478
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,919
very openness that they've given to talk

479
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,079
about this attack that helps security

480
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,799
companies like us like you guys many of

481
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,000
us

482
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,079
and it also helps other organizations

483
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,959
learn about the mistakes made before the

484
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,280
attack

485
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,720
so you go to work monday morning nine

486
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,120
o'clock hair on fire wolf everything's

487
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,600
encrypted nothing's working

488
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,520
where do you start

489
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,240
can you recover

490
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,760
i think it's pretty bad statistics what

491
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,840
we're actually reading here

492
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,880
33 said well you know well we've got a

493
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,200
plan it looks pretty good on paper yep

494
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,120
that's fine that's good

495
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,559
disaster plan yep check done

496
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,880
have you done a disaster plan

497
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,480
what about testing the disaster plan

498
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,440
one question that we do get asked or

499
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,960
that i actually ask our customers is

500
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,799
where do you store this disaster plan

501
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,280
oh and then that's box

502
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,039
is that the nas box that's connected to

503
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,760
active directory yes it is well okay

504
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,799
it's a start but if your 80 goes down

505
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,880
what's going to happen our 80's never

506
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,840
gone

507
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,000
down okay i actually had i actually had

508
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,600
new life i had that on the question i

509
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,918
had a 100 try not to laugh

510
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,080
the thing is

511
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,280
when you're talking about active

512
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,840
directory disaster plans recovering

513
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,000
lots of companies get really nervous

514
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,080
when they when we start talking about

515
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,919
disaster recovery and active directory

516
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,080
we recommend to our customers that they

517
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,840
go through the process

518
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,720
once every quarter we also offer

519
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,520
guidance where to store backups where to

520
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,679
resort to disaster plan i'll give you

521
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,679
another takeaway right now

522
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,520
do not store your disaster plans or any

523
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,120
data that you may need in case of a

524
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,760
disaster on any device that is connected

525
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,160
to active directory

526
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,760
it's just a no go and it's never going

527
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,160
to work

528
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,600
so the crisis is going to strike and i

529
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,000
can guarantee you the crisis will strike

530
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,440
it's going to hit the next company it's

531
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,640
going to hit the next company it's going

532
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,880
to hit the next company how long till it

533
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,000
hits your organization

534
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
what kind of what kind of questions do

535
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,960
you need to ask before the crisis

536
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,720
strikes

537
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,240
as i've told you

538
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,000
or since saturday i've been in so

539
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,799
involved in an incidence response

540
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,799
the very first communication we had to

541
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,080
be the customer

542
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,000
the customer didn't even know his name

543
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,280
anymore

544
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,840
they are really that much sinking in

545
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,039
panic

546
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,840
this is the end of the company

547
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,000
they didn't even know exactly

548
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,320
what risk they've been put out to they

549
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,840
didn't even know exactly how many

550
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,200
systems have been affected and the

551
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,799
customer and we're talking even

552
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,159
management level

553
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,960
very very very nervous in fact the very

554
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,760
first

555
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,320
something like 35 minutes

556
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,159
we were calming just the customer down

557
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,240
just to get him rationally thinking

558
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,360
again

559
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,960
and again thinking about your

560
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,159
organization

561
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,640
how would your organization react when

562
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,760
suddenly you cannot work anymore

563
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,440
so there's a lot of questions your

564
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
company's got to start organizations has

565
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,799
got to start

566
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,880
if you're a sizeo great one you're in a

567
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,679
good position to start mobilizing your

568
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,080
teams getting some answers for yourself

569
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,880
so you can understand the risks

570
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,039
so what kind of what kind of questions

571
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,039
do you need to be asking yourself

572
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,360
critical applications what applications

573
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,120
are so critical to our to our

574
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,840
organization

575
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,840
microsoft has written

576
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,880
a document called the forest microsoft

577
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,720
files recovery document

578
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,600
it's a quite nice document by the way

579
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,799
it's dry it's very complex about manual

580
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,640
steps needed to recover your active

581
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,159
directory

582
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,559
i can recommend it to anybody who's

583
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,799
working as an administrator for a domain

584
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,158
controller however

585
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,400
if your ad has just been encrypted by

586
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,760
attackers

587
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,240
you have never tried a fast recovery

588
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,440
manually

589
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,080
you haven't even seen this document even

590
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,840
worse you saved this document on the nas

591
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,480
box connected to ad right but it's okay

592
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,000
web pages you've got to love them you

593
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,960
can always get to the info

594
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,000
then maybe you will be overwhelmed by

595
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,159
this document

596
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,120
it is

597
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,159
pretty complex document

598
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,280
90 pages long of 90 pages long

599
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,760
very dry manual recovery steps reactive

600
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,120
directory

601
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,039
if anyone has any difficulties find it

602
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,720
come down to me stand one i'll show you

603
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,320
the link i can send it to you whatever

604
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,360
you guys need

605
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,039
no problems

606
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,320
so there's a whole load of there's a

607
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,840
whole load of questions you need to ask

608
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,600
yourself

609
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,039
one of the questions i would like to

610
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,840
point out as well have you tested your

611
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,159
procedure

612
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,400
what is your organization going to do in

613
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,559
case of an attack

614
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,840
who's going to take over what role

615
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,200
not worried about your sharepoint team

616
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,640
they can't do anything until you active

617
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,159
directions back up and running again

618
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,880
your first is going to be getting your

619
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,600
active directory up and running

620
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,480
mesh shipping needed nine days to get

621
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,960
the active directory back up and running

622
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,760
although they had a running copy

623
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,440
by the way this server is a pretty

624
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,000
famous server now actually because they

625
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,320
actually flew it the next day from

626
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,679
somewhere in south africa i believe it

627
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,720
was in ghana in africa where it was flew

628
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,039
first class to great britain so they

629
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,120
could start the restore process so they

630
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,039
had one domain controller up and running

631
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,840
and they still needed nine days to get

632
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,440
active directory up and running so we

633
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,360
could start thinking about all the other

634
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,520
services

635
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,280
by the way these are very compressed

636
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,400
states about the steps needed

637
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
to recover your active directory

638
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,200
microsoft 90 pages semperius kind of

639
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,960
compromised it to 28 steps

640
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,039
we follow the nist cycle

641
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,120
identify the risk protest the service

642
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,840
detect the attack responding to attacks

643
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,400
and recovering from the attack

644
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,919
just going to fly through these products

645
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,200
at the moment because you come to come

646
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,880
downstairs and have a chat with me

647
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,440

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,200
your what does your active directory

649
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,880

active directory

663

we are looking for indicators of uh

665
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,679
indicators of exposures ways

configuration errors ways that an

667
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,159
attacker might misuse to try to gain

668
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,279
access to your active directory

your active directory for every change

739
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,000
that's been made also being enabled

740
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
giving you the capabilities of undoing

741
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,240
any change made in the active directory

742
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,000
it's not as if you get attacked at nine

743
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,760
o'clock in the morning and at ten past

744
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,159
nine the attackers are finished many of

745
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,559
these attack attacks

746
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,520
they've taken weeks if not months

747
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,279
months where an attacker has been trying

748
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,279
to change things in active directory

749
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,200
trying to get information trying to get

750
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,399
more privileges

751
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,399
if companies had the monitoring tool

752
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,320
seeing every change made in active

753
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,600
directory

754
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,440
many of these attacks could have been

755
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,039
stopped before is a big issue

756
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,440
the second tool active directory forest

757
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,520
recovery

758
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,559
we back up your active directory we save

759
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,880
the backups on the servers that are on

760
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,520
your dc's on a distribution point we

761
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,120
also recommend that you use

762
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,360
indestructible storage

763
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,600
storage right once read many times

764
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,679
we also recommend that for on your

765
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,200
on-premise backups do not use adjoined

766
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,840
storage boxes

767
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,960
simple how many companies have a

768
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,320
non-domain joint storage capability

769
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,200
what we've seen in the last experience

770
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,679
not many but that's where your dc backup

771
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,360
should be landing

772
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,440
because the hackers they're going to

773
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,600
encrypt not just active directory not

774
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,840
just your data but also they're going to

775
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,720
try and just destroy your backups

776
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,039
without active directory

777
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,440
you have nothing without advice we are

778
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,799

779
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,120

here with you today

807
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,279
i'm getting scared now

808
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,720
yeah one

809
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,279
small question uh two questions in fact

810
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,039
uh first question is

811
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,640
similar kind of protection is required

812
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,039
for ldap implementation also because

813
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,880
many organizations are not on 80 they

814
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,720
may be having ldap and similar attacks

815
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,640
are happening there also that is number

816
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
one question number let me answer this

817
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,880
question yeah so at the moment we do

818
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,039
support active directory we are looking

819
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,520
into other identity providers um you've

820
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,080
got your octa you've got um

821
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,440
aws google but it is at the moment we do

822
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,039
support active directory we're also

823
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,600
monitoring azure active directory um but

824
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,200
that's what we have at the moment we do

825
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,600
not have any ldap but i can't say that's

826
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,000
not on the um drawing boards for maybe

827
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,679
something we do at the end of the year

828
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,120
we'd have to chase up on the product

829
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,039
management team okay

830
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,039
from the attack perspective

831
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,120
the attacker compromises the privileged

832
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,559
account and then does the actual

833
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,399
directory modifications how do you

834
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,919
distinguish between this is the actual

835
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,600
administrator doing or the attacker

836
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,480
doing because the activity is similar

837
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,159
very good very good

838
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,600
question so basically how do we

839
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
distinguish about a domain administrator

840
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,360
and any other account basically our

841
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,960
product cannot do this

842
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,039
but what we offer is the monitoring

843
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,960
doesn't matter who made a change in the

844
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,120
active directory we will always be able

845
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,200
