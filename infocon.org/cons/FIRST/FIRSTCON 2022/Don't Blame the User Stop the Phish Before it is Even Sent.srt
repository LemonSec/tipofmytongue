2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,000

i want to remember you that the current

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,040
session will be a tlp-wide

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,640
and

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,640
to present the session name don't blame

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,640
the user stop the fish before it's even

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,520
sent

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,439
let me to introduce

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,000
hooth the best

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,420
thank you thank you

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,479
[Applause]

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,680
so hello everyone welcome to this talk

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,520
in which i will be talking about how we

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,079
can actually avoid having to blame the

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,160
user and

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,800
stop the fish before it is even sent

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,559
well before we dive fully into it i

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,320
think it kind can be useful to get to

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,719
know who i am i am vote advanced i'm

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,559
actually a founder of compound c

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,960
compound c is just a company that is

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,559
still in the build-up phase so you won't

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,000
find it anywhere on the internet yet

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,840
it's quite new

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,000
because i recently stopped from two

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,840
years working at nvizo as a red team

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,479
operator and after that i also worked

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,720
for as a penetration tester before that

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,840
i worked as a penetration tester at ui

31
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,320
and like if there is one thing that you

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,720
guys should remember about me is that

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,040
i'm on the offensive side like i like to

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,799
be the hacker itself

35
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,759
and i'm gonna explain you guys today

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,200
actually how to make my job a lot harder

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,520
and it's a bit ironical but it will make

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,000
me harder it will make the job for me

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,960
harder

40
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,200
and i'm going to do that in

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,280
i'm going to explain it in different

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,280
scenarios and i will guide you through

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,759
the whole phase of how i set up phishing

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,240
campaigns and how at each phase you

45
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,720
could actually start blocking me and i

46
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,200
will first show you how i set up a

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,360
campaign so before i am sending it how i

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,840
set up the infrastructure etc how i buy

49
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,320
the domain how i set up more

50
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,640
infrastructure related to it and then

51
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,200
how you can actually like in the next

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,920
phase how i will be sending the campaign

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,399
and how you can block me on there

54
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,680
now

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,239
as this is a blue teaming conference

56
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,480
mostly i will be really bringing the

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,959
purple approach to this so in the slide

58
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,640
deck you will see two different kind of

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,640
slides first you will see the red

60
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,319
teaming one and then you will see the

61
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,080
blue team in one so in red teaming i

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,400
will explain how i do things and in the

63
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,160
blue teaming how you can actually block

64
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,520
me on that

65
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,920
alright so for this

66
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,760
presentation i actually set up a whole

67
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,040
demo

68
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,280
and i set up like a fake company called

69
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,519
blueperfect.net which is like a

70
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,560
fictitious company like selling water

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,440
bottles or something similar and

72
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,360
the problem was that like demo gods were

73
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,760
not very merciful on me the

74
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,840
yesterday my cloudflare banned my

75
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,800
account

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,560
so

77
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,280
so uh today like i will um try to get to

78
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,200
know like show you most of the topics

79
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,560
that i want to show you with the

80
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,640
screenshots that i still have normally

81
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,239
i'm in the work of getting my account

82
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,319
unbanned again so all the techniques

83
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,760
that i will show you today you will

84
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,239
actually be able to

85
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,000
use them and try it out on all the

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,519
domains that i will be showing you today

87
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,360
because they have actually been set up

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,159
with the things that i'm telling you

89
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,879
all right let's first start if i'm going

90
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,959
on a red team

91
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,480
activity and i want to emulate an

92
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,519
adversary i have kind of an idea of the

93
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,840
scenario that i want to use first things

94
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,239
first i need to have a domain that i can

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,519
use for the full engagement and this is

96
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,239
how i will be choosing a domain if i

97
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,040
want to target blueperfect.net

98
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,480
as a domain

99
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,319
or like as a company there are different

100
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,879
techniques they can actually use to

101
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,959
choose a very good domain

102
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,760
there are different like fancy namings

103
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,480
for

104
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,120
like altering the original domain one is

105
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,439
typo squatting combo squatting and

106
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,560
doppelganger domain and all of these

107
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,120
could potentially be fake ones i really

108
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,879
like the the type of squatting ones

109
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,040
because those like are very hard to see

110
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,439
with the eye what actually is wrong with

111
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,159
them i like a quick tip like none of

112
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,680
these are uh

113
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,879
is the actual one they're all like fake

114
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,920
um

115
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,959
and

116
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,720
like that that's that's a really good

117
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,120
one so also i use combo squatting in

118
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,320
which i will be using like uh just the

119
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,919
regular domain but add something in

120
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,400
front of it for example blue perfect

121
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,960
europe.net it's a domain that i can

122
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,160
fully uh use and it still seems like

123
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,320
very legit for an end user inspecting

124
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,800
the url which they are always told to do

125
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,759
right

126
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,040
and then we also have doppelganger

127
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,639
domaining in which like i will see

128
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,520
how

129
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,160
what the different subdomains are of the

130
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,479
the different uh or like the legit

131
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,360
subdomains of blueperfect.net and then i

132
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,360
will just paste them together in for

133
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,320
example gyro blueperfect.net

134
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,639
and this is how i will actually start

135
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,479
buying my domain

136
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,720
now this is only like a first step and

137
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,039
probably some of you already know that

138
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,440
these can actually like be very hard on

139
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,320
me and you can detect that very early on

140
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,840
and there are several tools that

141
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,080
actually detect like different domains

142
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,280
being registered and that

143
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,600
that that will alert you if a domain

144
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,360
that might be suspicious specifically

145
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,280
for your company that you will get an

146
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,479
alert

147
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,880
here in this slide i actually

148
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,240
put the

149
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,400
example of dns twister which is an open

150
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,120
source software and you can just go to

151
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,479
dnstwister.report i think it is and

152
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,080
there you can type in your domain and

153
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,320
then see you will get a list of all the

154
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,720
domains that have been like altered in

155
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
some kind of form that have been

156
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,240
registered and if you go to the second

157
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,160
tab like to the available tab you will

158
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,560
see all kinds of different domains that

159
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,800
have been altered in some way that might

160
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,440
be used to target your environment so it

161
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
might already be a very good idea to

162
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,840
just take a list of those domains and

163
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,080
block them straight away because chances

164
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,560
of them being used for legitimate

165
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,600
reasons are close to none

166
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,919
all right and if you want to have like a

167
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,319
more uh automated version of this there

168
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,479
are several paying tools i listed some

169
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,400
of them below i don't have any

170
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,199
experience like using any of these so i

171
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,520
will leave that up to you on

172
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,840
how you can implement those

173
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,120
now

174
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,880
as a red teamer i

175
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,120
kind of know that probably like i

176
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,039
searched through linkedin i try to see

177
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,759
if there are any job descriptions

178
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,240
saying that your company might use any

179
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,479
of those services shown in the the last

180
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,360
page

181
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,479
and

182
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,960
i try to avoid those by all means i

183
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,160
don't want to set up the whole

184
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,199
infrastructure send my mail to know okay

185
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,199
you actually already got me at the first

186
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,360
part where i bought a domain

187
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,440
and before and because i want to like

188
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,000
and anticipate that i'm gonna buy a

189
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,400
domain which is completely digit which

190
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,240
for you does not have any reference to

191
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,319
for example blue perfect

192
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,000
and an example would be

193
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,840
registrationportal.com

194
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,840
would be

195
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,360
conference2020.com or online file share

196
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,400
if i want to send like a malicious

197
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,880
malicious excel document or something

198
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,000
and

199
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,560
of course like those can seem a bit more

200
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,280
weird and to add a bit more to the to

201
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,680
the legitimacy is i will add a subdomain

202
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,680
for example blue perfect to make it

203
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,520
legit for the user actually inspecting

204
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
it so that they see the domain see it

205
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,440
doesn't have any spelling mistakes right

206
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,520
it might be legit

207
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,639
but

208
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,560
that is how i do it

209
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,960
and you can actually already block me on

210
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,880
that part as well

211
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,680
if

212
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,280
you if i am registering a domain and i

213
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,000
am uh like i have set it up you you

214
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,520
can't so for example i bought

215
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,599
registrationportal.com

216
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,479
and you try to detect me

217
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,599
the

218
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,240
if i set up the ssl encryption for it

219
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,160
all the subdomains for which dssl has

220
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,759
been set will be reflected in

221
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,080
certificate transparency logs

222
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,639
and senses is a very powerful tool to

223
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,080
actually go through these certificate

224
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,039
transparency logs and try to find

225
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,280
names with blue perfectly reflected in

226
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,800
this so if you would do that for

227
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,840
blueperfect.net you would actually find

228
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,039
like the one at the bottom that is

229
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,400
highlighted and that is the

230
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,400
blueperfect.fileportalcloud.com

231
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,280
and that is actually one of the

232
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,360
malicious

233
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,360
domains that i have but that i have

234
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,760
bought set up and this might already be

235
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,080
a very strong indicator oh this domain

236
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,479
is malicious so let's just block it

237
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,760
straight away all right

238
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,080
as an adversary of course i can also

239
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,680
anticipate on you like monitoring these

240
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,839
certificates certificate transparency

241
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,800
logs and what i will do personally then

242
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,880
i really like to use cloudflare because

243
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,279
cloudflare really gives you the wildcard

244
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,160
ssl certificates so if you would go and

245
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,640
look for your um look for your company

246
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,720
in the certificate transparency logs you

247
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,000
will not see it reflected in the

248
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,839
subdomains because the only thing that

249
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,760
they is reflect this is the wild card

250
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,560
certificate so this way i can actually

251
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,279
use a domain that is very legit looks

252
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,600
very legit but is still remaining under

253
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,279
the radar

254
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,399
now

255
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,440
let's say

256
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,480
you found my domain i um like with the

257
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,080
previous example of the wildcard

258
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,279
certificates

259
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,399
i

260
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,480
think you can already like catch maybe

261
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,800
50 of the red teamings out there like

262
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,640
this is the wildcard certificate is

263
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,000
something that i only learned like half

264
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,200
a year ago

265
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,880
and before that like we could have been

266
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,839
caught thousands of times on that so it

267
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,680
might be a very powerful technique for

268
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,640
you to implement in in your organization

269
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,959
but let's say i didn't do that and you

270
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,399
found my domain so for example

271
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,839
fileportalcloud.com you found it in the

272
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,680
certificates

273
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,240
and very powerful thing to do next is to

274
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,320
actually see how can i use this domain

275
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,640
and pivot to other thread infrastructure

276
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,600
out there

277
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,760
straight infrastructure that might be

278
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,760
related to the initial domain that i

279
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,040
have

280
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,240
and you can use make use of me being a

281
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,839
lazy ass

282
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,079
as a red team we have to set up like a

283
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,120
lot a lot of domains and we try to be

284
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,959
efficient and

285
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,800
being trying to be efficient also as it

286
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,440
compromises because i'm going to reuse

287
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,000
servers i'm going to reuse

288
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,880
recategorization templates i'm going to

289
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,839
reuse domain names and all those things

290
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,279
make that because there are some

291
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,440
similarities between two that you can

292
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,240
actually

293
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,440
nicely correlate in between and those

294
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,079
correlations can come from ip addresses

295
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,560
can go from us database we can go from

296
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,959
html hashes that you can search online

297
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,560
and it can come from image hashes that

298
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,880
you also can correlate together

299
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,000
and in this example i have used

300
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,200
the the graph functionality of virus

301
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,720
total

302
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,959
it's actually a very powerful tool to

303
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,519
correlate uh different domains together

304
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,680
so in this slide i have

305
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,920
entered fileportalcloud.com

306
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,399
and then virusturtle would automatically

307
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,880
give me a lot of the different um the

308
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,079
different uh notes correlated to it and

309
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,160
we can see there we have like the ip

310
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,079
address here of the united states and

311
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,920
maybe if we would double click that

312
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,160
virustotal automatically get all the

313
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,959
related notes from that part

314
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,440
and then brings us to here and the funny

315
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,959
thing is like

316
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,160
new

317
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,079
new domains are popping up because they

318
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,800
have once historically for example been

319
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,360
pointed to the same ip address as

320
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,120
fileportalcloud.com

321
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,279
has been and this way you can actually

322
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,440
start like correlating a lot of these

323
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,760
different domains to each other

324
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,040
now

325
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,440
i as an adversary again anticipate on

326
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,880
that like a bit of the cat and mouse

327
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,040
game right as a return teamer i will

328
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,360
anticipate on that and will try to break

329
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,360
that initial ip dns

330
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,800
correlation by always using a unique ip

331
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,399
or using a

332
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,959
unique dns name or try to blend in with

333
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,399
the masses all right if i am for example

334
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,839
in uh if i'm for example in cloudflare

335
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,839
you would see an ip address from

336
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,519
cloudflare but there are thousands and

337
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,279
thousands of different domains connected

338
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,000
to that same ip address and i basically

339
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,760
become like a needle in the haystack and

340
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,320
it will be really hard for you to like

341
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,560
weed those out

342
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,360
now

343
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,920
don't be sad like it's still possible to

344
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,120
to make other correlations of my

345
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,519
of my domains and that is actually by

346
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,240
using the pages that have been in front

347
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,760
of it and

348
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,000
correlate those together now this is the

349
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,959
part that actually got fully broken with

350
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,560
my cloudflare

351
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,600
abandoning so here i included uh a

352
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,639
screenshot from uh brand defense.io

353
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,040
they have a very good source on thread

354
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,720
hunting these

355
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,160
these kind of fishing pages so i

356
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,920
definitely recommend you to check these

357
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,880
out

358
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,800
all right and what they actually do is

359
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,360
they go and they take the hash of a

360
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,200
phishing page that they found like from

361
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,600
for example the favicon dot

362
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,560
ico

363
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,560
and they will search that in a service

364
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,720
like showdown to see which other

365
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,800
services are actually which other web

366
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,560
pages are actually

367
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,079
showing these

368
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,519
in the front

369
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,920
and this way you can actually detect

370
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,079
more domains that might be suspicious or

371
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,480
targeted your company a very good idea

372
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,639
might be to just use your own favicon

373
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,360
for example from blooper blueperfect.net

374
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,000
and then see if it pops up on any weird

375
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
domains which probably is very

376
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,399
suspicious to the company

377
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,120
you can also do this with images

378
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,120
full html hashes and servers like

379
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,880
urlscan.io and it's also possible if you

380
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,440
use the business version of virustotal

381
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,160
like the intelligence version and with

382
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,560
that you can also search on hashes and

383
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,880
correlate different domain domains to

384
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,959
each other but that is paid version and

385
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,240
these versions are for free

386
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,639
all right but like as an attacker then i

387
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,360
also try to anticipate that again

388
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,320
and

389
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,160
like this is the part where for me as an

390
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,760
attacker the cost of setting up a

391
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,760
fishing campaign against you and trying

392
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,440
to be fully upset

393
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,399
becomes incredibly hard if i want to

394
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,600
avoid you correlating based on icons on

395
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,279
images then it would actually have to

396
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,000
obfuscate a full html file i would have

397
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,839
to obfuscate images

398
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,160
i would have to try to

399
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,000
create the i have to try to create um

400
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,240
like templates which have been used like

401
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,720
thousands of time again and just to be

402
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,240
unique and blend in with the masters

403
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,040
again and you can feel the cost

404
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,800
for me setting up

405
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,279
a complete uh phishing campaign is

406
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,120
incredibly difficult and that is what we

407
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,519
want to get to right make my life

408
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,680
as hard as possible

409
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,040
now

410
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,199
let's say

411
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,560
you didn't detect my domains right so i

412
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,360
had everything fully proof

413
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,600
i did everything ops like safe such that

414
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,680
like a correlation or just detection of

415
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,199
one of my domains

416
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,279
was almost not possible

417
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,000
it's not too late like if i go and click

418
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,519
the send button there are still

419
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,120
different things that you can actually

420
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,839
do

421
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,279
to

422
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,000
block me on that now one of those is

423
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,399
reputation based filtering it's also one

424
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,040
of these things that like make my life

425
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,079
so incredibly more harder just the cost

426
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,079
of making an attacking against a company

427
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,240
using reputation based filtering is a

428
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,240
lot higher instead than just doing a

429
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,680
regular one

430
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,399
so

431
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,320
very like um

432
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,240
these are two servers that i come often

433
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,560
across in in companies that i'm testing

434
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,480
and it's like for example blue coat or

435
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,079
talus from cisco and these will go and

436
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,639
scan the internet and then for every

437
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,480
domain that they find they will actually

438
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,720
paste a reputation and a category on

439
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,120
there and that means that if i just set

440
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,399
up my domain

441
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,360
and i did everything like i should and

442
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,320
i send my email to you

443
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,240
then it will get into the reputation

444
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,920
based filtering and it will see oh this

445
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,320
domain is less than 30 days old oh this

446
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,920
domain is

447
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,519
not it doesn't have a category it's

448
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,759
unknown so it's probably suspicious we

449
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,800
block it

450
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,880
and then again my whole effort of

451
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,800
setting everything up like the whole

452
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,920
walkthrough

453
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,839
done for nothing

454
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,000
and this can be done on different things

455
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,920
by these vendors it can be done on ip

456
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,720
reputation domain reputation also the

457
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,800
domain age so and

458
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,000
so also the mail server reputation but

459
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,880
also on content wise so these are a lot

460
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,639
a lot of different things that as a red

461
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,399
teamer i have to take into account

462
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,120
trying to bypass these

463
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,079
and if i want to like bypass these this

464
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,000
again a lot more that i have to take

465
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,480
into account if i'm gonna look and i

466
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,600
want to get

467
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,559
like a good ip reputation then i will

468
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,400
use your tools that you might use to

469
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,119
analyze it and i will actually

470
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,119
see does this ip address have a bad

471
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,280
reputation for example it has been used

472
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,359
by a different one and if that is from a

473
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,280
cloud vendor i can just simply shut down

474
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,000
my vm get a new one and then it will be

475
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,959
okay

476
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,400
well if you are um if i want to do it

477
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,319
another way and i want to just get like

478
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,480
an ip address a high reputation ap

479
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,559
address straight away i can actually use

480
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,400
cloudflare and cloudflare will provide

481
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,720
me with an ip address there are so many

482
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,400
requests going there that has a higher

483
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,039
reputation and i can just make use of

484
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,880
that straight away

485
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
and then also like for the domain

486
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,200
reputation that one is a bit harder i

487
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,600
actually have to buy my domain like a

488
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
lot in advance best is like if i have it

489
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,679
for over a year and i um need to set it

490
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,039
up with like a fake template for example

491
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,919
uh like a copy of the blue perfect uh

492
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,720
site and then try to get that domain

493
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,960
categorized and aged on time by one of

494
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,280
these vendors but that can be a very

495
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,840
troublesome process like i still

496
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,799
remember like one year ago it was very

497
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,039
easy you just bought a domain you let it

498
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,880
be there you didn't touch it and then

499
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,880
once you had an assessment you would go

500
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,520
there you would set up your domain and

501
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,000
you would paste like a quick server next

502
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,320
to it did the categorization service

503
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,120
would paste a category in yet and once

504
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,799
it was done we just

505
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,160
take the server down and start

506
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,840
developing our fish

507
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,200
well last year i i cried several times

508
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,160
the

509
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,640
it was blue coat and uh also talos

510
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,600
intelligence they started to um

511
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,799
like monitor several times so it would

512
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,960
scan the first time paste the category

513
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,200
but then if i would be going further and

514
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,039
i would take down the server they would

515
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,240
see it and they would market the

516
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,080
suspicions again and it would not get it

517
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,559
categorized anymore so then i had to

518
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,360
restart the whole process over again so

519
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,320
again the cost for me getting very high

520
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,000
um maybe

521
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,160
one thing that you should be like aware

522
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,640
of is that like a trick i really like to

523
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,799
use a lot of the times is that you have

524
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,960
these top-level domains which are not

525
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,160
actually top-level domains for example

526
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,039
i could buy a domain that has

527
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,360
com like.eu.com a lot of these services

528
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,320
will then look for uh like the top level

529
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,840
domain and they would just see okay the

530
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,080
top level domain is dot com

531
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,120
well actually

532
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,679
and then the domain is eu so they would

533
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,679
come and check for the age of the domain

534
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,240
and instead of looking at

535
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,039
blueperfect.eu.com they only looked at

536
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,280
the last part and they see okay the age

537
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,559
is 26 years and the technology the

538
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,960
categorization is tech and then as an

539
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,600
attacker i'm like sweet

540
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,480
and

541
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,840
so that's a trick that i really like to

542
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,600
use so you should also be aware of that

543
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,400
and

544
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,720
another thing that we might try to do is

545
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,799
buy expired domains i'm not a really big

546
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,400
fan of that because it's really hard to

547
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,559
get an expired domain that doesn't look

548
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,320
like that doesn't look fishy all the

549
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,799
expired domains either look fishy or

550
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,960
like don't have a category to attach to

551
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,080
it anymore

552
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,000
and i will also try to aim for like

553
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,120
financial category or military or health

554
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,880
because in some

555
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,320
not all of them but then some best

556
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,480
practices is actually stated for these

557
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,200
deep level packet inspections softwares

558
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,039
that you should exclude these categories

559
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,480
because they might contain very

560
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,799
sensitive information and that is of

561
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,360
course like we want to be excluded as

562
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,400
well right

563
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,960
so we will try and blend in with there

564
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,159
as well

565
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,280
now

566
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,919
we also have the mail server reputation

567
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,600
and that is something i will not even

568
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,919
try to set up my own server that's just

569
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,559
guaranteed to be landed in the spam and

570
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,280
for that i just can easily use these

571
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,039
services like

572
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,760
sand grits or mail gun that have a high

573
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,840
reputation on their own as well and that

574
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,559
they can just use them and also like

575
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,159
just as a last one i need to be very

576
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,080
aware of the content if my mails that

577
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080
i'm sending have like a very fishy

578
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
content a fishy feel to it

579
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,000
that will bring the reputation down

580
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,400
quite drastically and i have to start

581
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,159
overall again because it just went

582
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,080
straight into the the

583
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,720
spam folder

584
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,120
now there are already three steps that

585
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,200
we went through so the first one would

586
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,400
be like

587
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,799
you detecting me to

588
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,760
block the to to you detecting me buying

589
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,159
a malicious domain the second would be

590
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,039
to

591
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,559
from that domain you could pivot to

592
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,880
other domains and then potentially like

593
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,960
burn my whole in trade infrastructure

594
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,200
already from the first go and then the

595
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,120
third one is that you would detect me

596
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,559
during the launch

597
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,000
through

598
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,400
reputation based services

599
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,360
and

600
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,960
let's say i

601
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,280
i was very advanced i took a lot of time

602
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,840
in my my setup and i could bypass all of

603
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,200
those steps

604
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,360
then it's still not too late

605
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,480
if you as an attacker could like it

606
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,240
could do a lot of endpoint hardening to

607
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,919
make an execution of for example a

608
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,880
maldoc document for me virtually

609
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,360
impossible if you would set up macro

610
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,960
execution hardening and then i'm

611
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,360
thinking about mark of the web with

612
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,000
which is now default by microsoft but

613
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
also if you would enforce like signed

614
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,640
macros that only side micros can run if

615
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,320
you would be using app locker like a

616
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,159
good configuration in conv in

617
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,559
combination with exploit guard if you

618
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,320
would have a service that does file

619
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,080
filtering such that not all documents

620
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,480
can be downloaded from the internet or

621
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,039
if you have like a very decent edr

622
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,640
solution

623
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,440
then i can do everything like right from

624
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,840
the setup but in the end i will just go

625
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,000
there and cry in a corner because like

626
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,640
for me it's really hard to to bypass all

627
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,240
of these protections

628
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,799
and that is like if you want to make it

629
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,280
for me virtually impossible i strongly

630
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,919
recommend to implement these in your

631
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,320
organization

632
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,280
and this is of course like a lot of the

633
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,080
cat and mouse game that you've seen now

634
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,720
from me and i really like i wish for you

635
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,280
to make my life as hard as possible as a

636
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,720
red team okay and uh then

637
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,799
that this uh so that is really the main

638
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,520
topic that i wanted to give uh to you so

639
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,760
don't always blame the user there are a

640
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,559
lot a lot of things that we as an as a

641
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,080
company can actually already do to

642
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,799
protect our valuable users to so that

643
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,640
they it doesn't even matter if they

644
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,840
clicked the link or not we got them

645
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,760
covered all right that's my talk thank

646
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,158
you guys

647
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,120
thank you thank you all for the

648
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,440
nice point of view let me say

649
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,679
you say right we never

650
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,840
at least maybe

651
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,000
not every time we have to blame the user

652
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,080
but let me say in the last point you

653
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,720
speak about the input endpoint we can

654
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,120
prevent the point if the user is inside

655
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,720
our organization

656
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,960
but it is a customer as example for the

657
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,039
bank for the financial services

658
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,279
yes in the first case you speak about

659
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,400
all the

660
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,760
uh

661
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,000
cyber squatting or squatting

662
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,360
and you can prevent it but maybe our alf

663
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,279
all the phishing that we receive

664
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,200
because helpful phishing are

665
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,039
nothing related with keyword on the

666
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,799
domain or something so you cannot

667
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,360
prevent it in that case we have to blame

668
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,400
the user

669
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,320
maybe we have also to destroy the user

670
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,440
device me to use the paper but

671
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,600
let me say if someone else have some

672
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,440
question for hood

673
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,799
on the stage you have to go to the

674
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,679

[Music]

678
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,000
thank you for very interesting talkwood

679
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,840
i was wondering throughout the talk

680
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,360
you're more and more talking about

681
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,679
defend against the red team yeah what

682
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,919
guarantee do you have the techniques

683
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,440
that you're employing

684
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,960
are actually the ones we try to block

685
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,440
that's a good point the

686
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,440
well as a red team we try to stay as

687
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,600
close to like real attackers of course

688
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,200
as possible

689
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,000
but the real attackers can often like do

690
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,600
things that we are not allowed to do for

691
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,159
example compromise a web server online

692
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,000
so these techniques that we try to do is

693
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,559
like to get as close as possible

694
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,320
i can't give any guarantees that we are

695
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,720
like exactly the same we do it's we do

696
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,440
we try our best

697
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,679
there is someone else for wood

698
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,919
