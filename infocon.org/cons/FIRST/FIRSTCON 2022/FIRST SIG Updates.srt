1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,519
morning everyone i'm tracy bills from

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,440
the first board of directors and i have

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,280
the pleasure this morning of

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,360
facilitating the updates from the

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,279
special interest groups

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,880
so first up this morning is the cvss sig

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,119
dave dugal

8
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,200
thank you everyone and uh welcome to a

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,280
wicked early morning on the last day of

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,640
the sig so

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,399
i will go as quickly as possible as long

12
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,960
as i know which button to push so uh

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,440
as you may or may not have heard cvss is

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,200
the common vulnerability scoring system

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,480
and we've been through several

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,879
iterations from uh back in the days when

17
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,160
we just thought it was a pretty cool

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,520
idea to uh now having version 4.0 being

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,559
worked

20
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,719
so the the major high-level

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,480
accomplishments for 4-0 are uh based on

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,080
feedback from

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,920
30 members that attend every week for

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,960
several years so after 3 000 hours of

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,640
person hours of effort we've come up

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,479
with a finer granularity for base

27
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,000
metrics which is

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
something that has been asked for

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,080
as you know cvss goes from 0 to 10 and

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,680
sometimes there are bucketizations so

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,200
we're trying to add a little more

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,000
fluidity to those 99 values

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,840
we've added attack requirements uh

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,240
enhanced user interaction

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,159
sometimes there's a

36
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,280
an easy way to fool a

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,880
user and sometimes it's a difficult way

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,560
so now we have a little more granularity

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,759
there

40
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,280
everybody loves scopes so this is going

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,040
to cause a tear to into everyone's eye

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,720
but we've decided to remove scope and

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,119
instead remove that lossy compression

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,040
and increase the confidentiality

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,280
integrity and availability to the

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,880
vulnerable and impacted components so

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,200
that that should help a little bit

48
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,680
in being able to convey and surprisingly

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,520
have juniper and cisco actually agree on

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,560
scoring

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,399
um there's also

52
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,920
temporal has always been this sort of

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,320
concept of time but really it's threat

54
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,200
so what we've done is replace temporal

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,280
with the threat metrics and also there

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,360
have been a couple of um metrics that

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
are always the same almost always the

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,080
same value usually uh evil vendor won't

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,599
come out with an advisory until we

60
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,680
already have a fix so we already know

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,319
what the fixed state is and we also know

62
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,599
that it's pretty confident if we're

63
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,959
going to publish an advisory that

64
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,080
there's uh that there's it's confirmed

65
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,760
so we've we've boiled that down to

66
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,360
exploit maturity that actually works

67
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,280
pretty pretty well with the concepts

68
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,200
like epss where um you have a threat

69
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,720
based on exploit maturity um and then

70
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,519
the new thing is uh supplemental metrics

71
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,840
there are a lot of so

72
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,480
the the base metrics are the intrinsic

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,160
characteristics of a vulnerability

74
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,840
supplemental metrics give the the kind

75
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,680
of the just-in-time additional

76
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,200
information that may or may not be

77
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,400
required

78
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,920
to make a decision on whether to patch

79
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,680
because at the end of the day you want

80
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,400
patch priority among many things so

81
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,920
we've added supplemental metrics

82
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,640
automatable recovery value density

83
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,159
vulnerability response effort and

84
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,239
provider urgency i could spend a half

85
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,319
hour on each of those and at 10 o'clock

86
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,920
i probably will

87
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,080
but it does quite align to another

88
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,599
four-letter

89
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,080
acronym ssvc so some of those things you

90
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,000
may have seen in the ssvc presentation

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,159
they do align precisely with that it's

92
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,239
decision tree

93
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,760
and finally

94
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,959
those of us who've been around for a

95
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,120
while believe that sun workstations and

96
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,720
and juniper routers around the world but

97
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,080
in fact there's this whole other part of

98
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,680
the world called ot operational

99
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,840
technology ics

100
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,879
these things keep us alive so we have

101
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,640
tipped our hat toward that by adding

102
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,400
additional safety metrics that will

103
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,319
allow people in the ot world that can

104
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,799
decide whether a plc may keep a fish

105
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,040
tank too cold or you know cause a

106
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,360
nuclear power plant to get too warm um

107
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,319
to score those types of things as well

108
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,560
we also have overarching messages none

109
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,040
of these are are quite new to anyone who

110
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,319
has

111
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,040
seen any blog posts on cvss

112
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,519
we have technical severity in cvss we do

113
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,560
not imply or infer risk

114
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,959
we are going to help people after you've

115
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,840
had enough nvd lookups to find out that

116
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,079
there's v2 and vt v3 scores for just

117
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,279
about everything you really don't want

118
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,959
three scores for everything now so we're

119
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,639
going to have some guidance on how to

120
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,160
migrate from three to four it's a less

121
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,400
of a step change than two to three

122
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,160
um and basically give

123
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,720
um more importance on uh the education

124
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,360
it's quite important to get cvss right

125
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,080
anyone with a blog post or a godaddy

126
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,479
domain can create a cvss score for just

127
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,479
about anything but authoritative scores

128
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,320
that are accurate and aligned with nvd

129
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,240
are important i think training is is

130
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,280
part of the

131
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,720
the

132
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,639
solution to that and of course the final

133
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,600
thing is

134
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,520
everybody loves grabbing cvss base

135
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,720
scores putting him into an excel

136
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,479
spreadsheet sorting by technical

137
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,919
severity and patching the top first

138
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,600
that's not the way it's supposed to work

139
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,759
there's something called bte based uh

140
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,600
threat and environmental that we now

141
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,479
have

142
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,639
and we're targeting the public preview

143
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,120
for december 2022

144
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,759
and i think that's my last one oh oh and

145
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,600
then if you trust bitly links there's a

146
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,800
bit.lee cvss v4 dash calculator url that

147
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,000
you can go in and see what we were

148
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,919
thinking for the last couple of years

149
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,280
and hover over things it doesn't

150
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,880
actually create the calculator score

151
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,639
because we're working with nist on the

152
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,199
math but for the most part that's um

153
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,120
that's one way to start seeing what

154
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,800
we're looking at and also give us

155
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,560
feedback about whether we're completely

156
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,520
off base or uh or close to the mark

157
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,330
thank you

158
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:44,769
[Applause]

159
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
thank you dave next

160
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,440
james will give us an update on both the

161
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,840
cti sig and the msrc

162
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,160
thank you so uh it's been another busy

163
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,919
year for the cyber threat intelligence

164
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,360
sig

165
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,000
i guess a lot of us in first do cyber

166
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,360
threat intelligence on some level uh and

167
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,880
this is uh

168
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,639
we we've been doing a lot of work over

169
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,080
the course of a year

170
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,240
focusing some of the conversations

171
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,639
around cyber threat intelligence

172
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,440
the goal of our sig is to create a

173
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,160
common set of definitions that allow us

174
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,960
to

175
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,880
have useful discussion about cyber

176
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,639
threat intelligence i think there's

177
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,520
probably

178
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,960
a lot of people in the world that say

179
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
you know we own the definition for it

180
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,800
our goal is to um the sig doesn't

181
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,479
necessarily isn't the global authority

182
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,000
on cyber threat intelligence but we want

183
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,680
to create a common

184
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,880
language that we can use to discuss it

185
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,599
and we actually started in 2018 in the

186
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,680
annual conference in kuala lumpur

187
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,639
and

188
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,120
probably one of our main products is a

189
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,000
common body of knowledge so this is

190
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,280
something we publish on the first

191
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,840
website it's a curriculum and a set of

192
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,039
resources

193
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,520
that anyone can use

194
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,599
to mature their cyber threat

195
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,680
intelligence program

196
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,639
today

197
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,080
we have 191 subscribe members

198
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,400
and we have quite a few of those showing

199
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,319
up every couple of weeks to our sig

200
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,880
meetings

201
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,440
so um

202
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,039
the mission and goal of the cyber threat

203
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,039
intelligence

204
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,280
sig is to promote the benefits of doing

205
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,960
cyber threat intelligence to make sure

206
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,440
it actually has use and has outcomes

207
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,160
that are are good for organizations

208
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,759
we've really spent a lot of time on that

209
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,000
common body of knowledge

210
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,120
and there's

211
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,840
resources tools data sources best

212
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,800
practices and methods there

213
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,879
we work with the

214
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,280
first team on various events so either

215
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,759
online or

216
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,199
in november in in person in berlin

217
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,680
our goal is not to be

218
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,319
a sharing environment i think first is

219
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,080
actually a very effective sharing

220
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,520
environment we have some wonderful

221
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,800
projects like

222
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,240
misp

223
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,479
and we also you know the first teams

224
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,240
themselves have an entire set of

225
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,199
mechanisms for sharing data but what we

226
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,039
talk about are best practices and

227
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,759
content so we stay out of the sharing

228
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,879
side of that

229
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,120
at the moment

230
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,720
uh our membership has been growing

231
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,360
consistently over time so uh this this

232
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,560
year we even managed to grow four

233
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,279
percent even in a in a pandemic a couple

234
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,760
of years that's been going really well

235
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,200
um if you want to find out more about

236
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,599
the sig there's a link up the top there

237
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,120
i guess these slides will be available

238
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,640
afterwards

239
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,959
the way we work with our members is we

240
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,120
realize that we've got to design a sig

241
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,839
for busy people everyone is busy

242
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,440
you can choose as to how you want to

243
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,360
participate you can either be a reviewer

244
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,320
a contributor or a curator and when you

245
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,720
sign up you get asked how you'd like to

246
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,760
engage

247
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,720
and that allows us to determine uh how

248
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,440
best to use your time

249
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,920
so in 22 we've been busy as ever

250
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,080
so we've got an update

251
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,920
to the curriculum that went out and

252
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,160
version three of that will be released

253
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,040
later this year

254
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,080
there's a lot of deliverables so we've

255
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,040
we've

256
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,800
released sections of the curriculum to

257
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,000
talk about a very simple maturity model

258
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,440
that people can use

259
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,279
we've been doing some work on threat

260
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,640
modelling so

261
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,240
we've got about five or six different

262
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,760
threat modeling techniques we've been

263
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,880
evaluating we've got some real examples

264
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,720
of those

265
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,880
and then we've got some

266
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,600
we have some presentation materials that

267
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,640
anybody

268
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,880
who would be interested can repurpose

269
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,800
for their own

270
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,640
use so we've just released a

271
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,800
a business stakeholder presentation

272
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,640
trying to help people put the business

273
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,200
case together for running a cyber threat

274
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,880
intelligence program

275
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,279
big thanks to everybody who worked very

276
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,760
hard on that the whole sig

277
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,360
got involved in putting that together

278
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,360
um i just wanted to give a shout out to

279
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,640
my co-chair uh adrian henrik uh agent

280
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,079
from your

281
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,279
hand up uh from lac uh without adrian we

282
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,640
would not be able to do uh even a tenth

283
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,200
of this adrian has made an enormous

284
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,880
contribution to

285
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,240
uh to the sig and uh it would not run

286
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,480
without his help so a big shout out to

287
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,839
my my co-chair

288
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,240
um if you're interested in science

289
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,360
threat intelligence come along to the uh

290
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,959
the symposium in berlin in november i've

291
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,640
got a great program coming together for

292
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,200
that and we'll shortly be announcing uh

293
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,760
that that program uh soon so really

294
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,440
excited about that it's going to be

295
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,120
first in-person threat intelligence

296
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,600
event for some time

297
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,399
um we will continue our

298
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,800
during 22 we we did a bunch of standard

299
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,480
bodies works we've got a thing called

300
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,480
the mega list which is basically a big

301
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,760
old list of links to resources and tools

302
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,880
we've done some work on in fact rick

303
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,279
very got very closely involved with

304
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,399
creating a new taxonomy for misp around

305
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,640
operational technology and

306
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,320
critical infrastructure

307
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,720
and then we've also uh this year had an

308
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,959
opportunity to work with mitre on

309
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,360
introducing some new techniques as well

310
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,800
i believe their approach to accepting

311
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,320
techniques recently updated as well

312
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,160
which is quite exciting so we're looking

313
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,600
forward to working on that with the

314
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,360
mitre team too

315
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,920
in terms of new projects so we're trying

316
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,760
to convert

317
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,519
some of our existing content into new

318
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,000
languages if you are interested in cyber

319
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,920
threat intelligence or an affluent in

320
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,240
both english and another language we

321
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,800
want to hear from you uh we want to get

322
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,440
your help uh getting this content

323
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,240
internationalised

324
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,399
we're also working on

325
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,360
some

326
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,839
we're looking at how we

327
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,360
improve the

328
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,680
the platform we use to promote products

329
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,160
and tools

330
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,680
and i mentioned some of the other

331
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,440
projects that we did earlier as well

332
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,720
so what's next so this year for the cci

333
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,480
sig we're going to keep we really do

334
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,560
want more members we we're we're trying

335
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,880
to find better ways of engaging

336
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,360
busy first members so we're keep an eye

337
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,560
out for some of those things this year

338
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,760
we're going to be

339
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,519
contacting folks to

340
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,440
try and get more

341
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
lightweight participation and benefit

342
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
from from that as well as our more

343
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,480
committed

344
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,600
members

345
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,440
um you're going to see a fourth version

346
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,399
of the

347
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,680
curriculum

348
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,360
with some additional chapters to fill

349
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,519
more of our gaps

350
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,040
and just keep an eye out yeah come to

351
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,720
the berlin in november

352
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,800
and we'll certainly be having some works

353
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,959
of workshops and training

354
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,320
coming up as well

355
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,000
we're also working on a new project

356
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,800
around table top exercises

357
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,959
in cyber threat intelligence so

358
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,480
some of our members

359
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,320
are putting something together around

360
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,680
that

361
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,200
we're going to be reviewing our work

362
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,800
plan

363
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,880
in our next meeting for

364
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,000
2023 so if you can come along to that

365
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,920
you're very welcome if you want to join

366
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,639
the sig please go on to the first

367
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,440
website there's a request to join button

368
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,240
there

369
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,690
thank you very much

370
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:38,000
[Applause]

371
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,680
so we're just swapping over

372
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,360
presentations so

373
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,839
i'm also one of the co-chairs for the uh

374
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:47,279
multi-stakeholder ransomware

375
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,040
sig as well so i'm i'm pleased to share

376
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,720
that with barry green

377
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,279
from akamai iron leverage who i'm sure

378
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,639
many of you will know

379
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,519
and uh i i help out too

380
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,920
um if you want to learn more about the

381
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,160
multi-stakeholder around tomosig

382
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,000
obviously listen to this but we've

383
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,160
got a link up there

384
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,839
to our broader

385
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,399
objectives and plan

386
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,120
so

387
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,279
what is the multi-stakeholder ransomware

388
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,399
sig well

389
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,279
the point is that ransomware

390
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,760
or combating ransomware takes a village

391
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,519
it is not a problem

392
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,560
that a single group of people will solve

393
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,320
on their own it's something that's got

394
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,199
to be

395
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,760
addressed through coordination

396
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,920
so the multi-stakeholder

397
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,199
part of this

398
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,800
is about coordinating and trying to

399
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,199
collaborate with other people who have a

400
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,160
stake in trying to resolve this problem

401
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,240
and at a minimum that includes uh

402
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,720
organizations like law enforcement

403
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,160
insurers policy makers governments but

404
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,079
from a first perspective you know

405
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,720
national certs c certs p certs all play

406
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,760
a role

407
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,720
so

408
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,360
we created a sig and it got created this

409
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,120
year to foster

410
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,720
collective action

411
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,639
against ransomware

412
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,440
now really importantly we do not want to

413
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,160
reinvent the wheel so the intent of this

414
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,959
sig

415
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,079
is to

416
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,920
collaborate with others working in this

417
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,800
space

418
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,199
and try and uh take actions that are

419
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,399
additive

420
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,360
to combating ransomware i think if we

421
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,279
you know we recognize we're not the only

422
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,680
group looking at this and we want to

423
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,480
help

424
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,839
others by collaborating

425
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,079
there are three main goals

426
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,720
one is to measure

427
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,279
how ransomware is evolving i think it's

428
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,720
hard to know

429
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,440
uh what's going on in real terms

430
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,000
without real data and

431
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,240
iron's been

432
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,920
kicked off a really great project

433
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,199
looking at

434
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,000
real

435
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,320
metrics based on real data so we're

436
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,000
looking at things like

437
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,160
um payments to

438
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,839
bitcoin addresses

439
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,399
and measuring how many of those payments

440
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,240
are made and where they're made

441
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,120
to give us a a broader picture on how

442
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,160
ransomware is currently evolved evolving

443
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,920
i really encourage you to come and have

444
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,680
a look at that it's a really interesting

445
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,839
data set and tells us some very real

446
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,240
things about how ransomware is evolving

447
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,639
the intent is for these resources to be

448
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,399
published to all first members i think

449
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,000
we've got a small group with this to

450
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,320
start with and we'll be uh broadening

451
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,639
that out over time

452
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,800
um we're also trying to collect together

453
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,560
resources we want to learn about what

454
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,399
other work people are doing and try and

455
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,320
collect that resources list together so

456
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,480
again we can share those with first

457
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,440
members so we've started that work uh it

458
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,800
is ongoing

459
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
but we've got quite a quite a few

460
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,720
contributions already and there's more

461
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,560
to come

462
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,639
and thirdly we want to listen

463
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,600
so

464
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,839
part of the point of multi-stakeholder

465
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,920
work is to

466
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,279
listen to people from different

467
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,360
backgrounds and disciplines it's really

468
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,519
interesting the role that things like

469
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,720
insurers play the role that

470
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,439
law enforcement can play and

471
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,319
the the role that organizations can play

472
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,280
in either encouraging or discouraging

473
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,359
ransomware

474
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,000
so we really want to support response

475
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,319
mitigation remediation investigation and

476
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,599
prevention

477
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,599
and uh we had to make a decision we

478
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,919
could either serve the world uh we could

479
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,840
focus a little bit more so we've decided

480
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,960
as a sig

481
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,520
to focus our efforts on producing

482
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,000
products that are interesting to the

483
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,880
first community

484
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,039
i've just got a this this doesn't even

485
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,480
remotely do the vast amount of data that

486
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,360
we've

487
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,440
managed to pull together justice but um

488
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,400
this is a one of the outputs that

489
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,559
we've got so we've got um we're looking

490
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,440
at ransomware amount of money paid by

491
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,760
ransomware groups over time

492
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,280
and what's really interesting if you

493
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,600
compare this to another graph which is

494
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,000
uh the the number of payments the number

495
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,360
of payments has stayed

496
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,799
largely similar or reasonably stable but

497
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,200
the size of those payments are going uh

498
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,600
much higher so this runs it's

499
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,840
interesting we still see data

500
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,679
on on um

501
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,679
ransomware groups who've been around

502
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,080
since the sort of the mid 2015

503
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,480
area so there's quite a large data set

504
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,840
that can tell you about how ransoms uh

505
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,120
and there's some really interesting

506
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,840
findings from that

507
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,000
so far so good so we've been meeting

508
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,600
every couple of weeks

509
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,039
since about the back end of last year um

510
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,799
what's been going well is we've been

511
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,360
getting sort of regular news updates on

512
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,520
recent examples uh latest group

513
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,880
behaviors

514
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,280
we usually spend 10 15 20 minutes of

515
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,840
that of every meeting revising those

516
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,240
we've invited speakers from

517
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,919
all over both the cyber security

518
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,000
industry but also from law enforcement

519
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,880
and other areas to come and speak

520
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,720
so we can understand their perspectives

521
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,720
better

522
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,480
we continue to move forward the data

523
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,120
project and that's been evolving uh

524
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,200
nicely more on that to come

525
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,120
and we've been talking about how we grow

526
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,679
as a community as well

527
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,120
like other sigs we have a slack

528
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,559
community

529
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,080
we're putting together some best

530
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,160
practice guide proposals

531
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,520
so we're just talking about the outlines

532
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,039
of those at the moment and we're

533
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,919
thinking about how we approach uh policy

534
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,280
i think those are areas that we'd like

535
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,320
to focus on in 2023

536
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,280
so we want to mature that data project

537
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,679
and try and get get the data out more

538
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,400
broadly but also invite more people to

539
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,720
contribute data to that data set we've

540
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,559
got some interesting ideas about how to

541
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,520
do that

542
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,080
we want to better define the problem so

543
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,080
we can support the evidence of what

544
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,240
collective actions will be most

545
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,760
effective

546
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,080
and we really want to think about rather

547
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,240
than sort of attacking a single group or

548
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,720
going for it think about broad systemic

549
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
changes that we can make through our

550
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,039
membership of first that might help with

551
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,960
the reduction of harm from this problem

552
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,640
that affects all of us as first members

553
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,440
so

554
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,520
yeah one of our founding objectives is

555
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,039
to produce deliverables that would

556
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,640
support policy makers and other

557
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,000
stakeholders

558
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,559
to take effective action i think this

559
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,159
year that's an area we would really like

560
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,760
to progress uh further

561
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,240
so that's about it you can find out more

562
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,400
on that link there and if you're

563

564
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,960

577
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,720
okay

578
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
okay

579
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,240
well

580
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,480
uh i remember that we started the

581
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,039
discussion of establishment of

582
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:37,919
uh

583
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,559
and space for us to discuss for us

584
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,280
academics and people that that works in

585
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,840
in reigns and universities

586
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,760
we decided to establish uh

587
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,600
as a specific sig in 2018. it was in

588
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,200
kuala lumpur

589
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,640
but we started this discussion in 2017.

590
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,960
um well this is a

591
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,159
a forum and a space that uh the idea is

592
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,799
to brings together people who has

593
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,840
uh who works in

594
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,520
in security and css specifically

595
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,679
or also are part of the first community

596
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,400
that acts in academic sector academic

597
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,440
and research sector

598
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,280
we understood

599
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,960
that we have

600
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,799
we could share

601
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,120
information and that we have a similar

602
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,320
challenges

603
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,679
similar

604
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,400
problems and especially that we can

605
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,159
share a

606
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,200
especially we can share solutions to

607
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,760
those to those problems and how we

608
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,039
overcame

609
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,120
for those challenges

610
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,039
uh

611
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,520
currently we are almost 60 members

612
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,960
yesterday we had uh one of our meetings

613
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,600
uh our face-to-face meetings um some

614
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,000
people came to us and and they were they

615
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,600
told us that they are interested in

616
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,679
joining the group

617
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,640
um

618
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,880
well

619
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,120
yes

620
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,240
okay

621
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,080
thank you

622
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,960
so

623
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,840
well we started having

624
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,520
we started having

625
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,039
face-to-face meetings only but

626
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,760
not only because of the pandemi but also

627
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,039
because we we realized that we needed to

628
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,280
to to keep a

629
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,360
more regular communication along the

630
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,600
year so we started some virtual meetings

631
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,640
uh

632
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,320
as i said we started in 2018

633
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,400
and um

634
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,440
this is a timeline of our uh

635
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,039
meetings along the all these

636
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,840
all these years

637
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,880
now

638
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,240
rather it's going to give you more

639
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,559
details on our working groups

640
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,000
and especially how you uh to join

641
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,159
or to apply if you are interested in

642
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,200
joining thank you

643
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,880
thank you nina

644
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,520
in 2020 uh to some extent we had a bit

645
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,200
of an uh

646
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,039
what do you call it an ex

647
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,679
existential uh crisis and said well now

648
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,360
we can't meet face to face anymore and

649
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,159
uh

650
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,559
our sig uh traditionally is mainly there

651
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,320
to network with one another to come

652
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,919
together to share some experiences hear

653
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,520
some interesting talks and go home and

654
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,080
apply what you've learned come back a

655
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,880
few months later you know repeat

656
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,679
and

657
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,440
we said well maybe there's more that we

658
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,039
should be doing

659
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,039
we ran a survey in 2020 with the speak

660
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,960
and said where would you like

661
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,520
us to focus on we also realized that uh

662
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,919
especially during the pandemic

663
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,039
people were very time constrained and if

664
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,480
sick activities were not part of their

665
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,320
primary day-to-day work then it

666
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,720
generally didn't happen so

667
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,559
we try to align our activities as

668
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,159
closely as possible for people really

669
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,760
need and are doing on a day-to-day basis

670
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,000
without duplicating the effort done by

671
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,159
other groups

672
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,799
so the list that you see is the outcomes

673
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,840
of that

674
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,880
and

675
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,559
as a result we established two working

676
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,240
groups that are active at the moment a

677
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,919
cti working group and an incident

678
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,000
response coordination working group

679
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,240
and the working groups needed to form

680
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,159
their own descriptions goals schedule

681
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,880
their meetings they have select channels

682
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,679
and it's generally made up of a subgroup

683
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,840
of the sig that's really interested in

684
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,399
that area

685
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,520
the cyber threat intelligence working

686
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,600
group its purpose is to identify good

687
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,919
practice for using ctr within academia

688
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,679
or research and education

689
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,000
they ran a server within the working

690
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,039
group

691
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,000
to determine who's using cti to what

692
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,200
extent

693
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,600
which tools are being used and

694
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,440
with the goal of moving towards

695
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,840
this stage of sharing information

696
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,080
between us not necessarily acting as the

697
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,320
conduit for that but facilitating it

698
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,799
in future the working groups going to to

699
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,400
have more meetings analyze the

700
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,640
questionnaires uh send it to broader

701
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,679
audience

702
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,640
and then see okay how can we work with

703
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,880
the likes of the cti sig which i found

704
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,240
very interesting and

705
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
improve the

706
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,760
cti

707
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,440
by and for research and education

708
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,200
our second working group focuses on

709
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,600
incident response coordination

710
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
its purpose is to improve and facilitate

711
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,159
the cross organization incident response

712
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,559
by collecting and disseminating relevant

713
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,760
information again it's not an

714
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,640
operational group so you're not going to

715
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,120
the idea is not to be a

716
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,360
forum or body that can coordinate

717
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,039
incident response within the research

718
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,799
and education community there are other

719
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,200
more suitable forms for that but to

720
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,480
establish

721
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,400
lines of communication hot topics of

722
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,039
interest and

723
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,480
one of the

724
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,120
areas that we've realized needed some

725
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,520
attention is this context database if

726
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,960
i'm looking for somebody at a pacific

727
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,360
university or a specific nren

728
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,279
aside from the

729
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,520
first members list aside from trusted

730
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,360
introducing things if i don't find the

731
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,320
information there were enough

732
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,000
information where can we go and can we

733
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,440
combine these also if you say we've just

734
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,000
got one place that we need to go when we

735
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
urgently need to reach out and contact

736
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,120
another team

737
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,520
there's also lots of opportunity for

738
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,279
building those

739
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,039
let's call it the informal connections

740
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,279
that are often most valuable in

741
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,799
responding to incidents when time is of

742
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,279
the essence

743
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,960
there are advantages to starting with an

744
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,640
a

745
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,399
and second letter being a c we top at

746
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,600
the top of the sig list so it's

747
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,120
generally quite easy to find us from the

748
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,960
sixth page um our sig is

749
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,559
uh open

750
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,559
we do not specifically require sig

751
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,559
members to be members of first that we

752
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,919
do encourage it and we are focused on

753
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,520
universities um enrins etc so

754
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,600
it generally makes the most sense to be

755
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,480
from an academic institute or related

756
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,080
institute at least have an interest in

757
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,159
that area

758
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,399
and from the sig page you can get the

759
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,000
the usual request to join button at the

760
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,440
bottom um and feel free to contact

761
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,520
nina or i at our

762
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,120
sig chairs email address for more

763
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,799
information and especially if you'd like

764
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,220
to join thanks

765
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:36,720
[Applause]

766
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,559
thank you next we'll hear from mark

767
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,440
zaychek with the metrics

768
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,039
good morning

769
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,960
uh thank you tracy yeah my name is mark

770
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,559
zach i'm gonna spend just a couple

771
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,360
minutes telling you about the metric sig

772
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,039
if you're not familiar with it

773
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,039
just like all the other sigs we have our

774
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,559
own web page

775
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,480
it tells more description about what the

776
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,200
what our sig is intended to

777
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,159
produce we are one of two sigs that are

778
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,640
listed currently as a discussion

779
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,880
sig not a uh standards or working group

780
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,960
sig uh but basically we're looking to

781
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,799
try to uh

782
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,720
put together information that can help

783
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,600
uh

784
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,840
c-certs or teams to develop

785
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,399
guidance or methods for evaluating their

786
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,679
effectiveness

787
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,480
of their incident management processes

788
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,240
again as a discussion group we have a

789
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,840
couple

790
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,520
products we've developed we're currently

791
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,960
working on some other things which i'll

792
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,440
tell you in just a moment and we also

793
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,840
get together and have webinars a couple

794
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,679
of the webinars have been recorded and

795
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,520
are currently available on the first uh

796
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,720
portal

797
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,080
if you look at the link under that

798
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,960
you'll see a link to those webinars

799
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,559
two of the projects i'll talk about this

800
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,799
morning are the security incident timing

801
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,960
metrics which we've already developed

802
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,559
and i have a couple slides to show you

803
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,039
what those timing metrics are

804
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,720
we're currently also looking at

805
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,399
developing and mapping

806
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,640
different sea search services to some of

807
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,200
the metrics that we've identified and

808
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,960
i'll tell you a little bit about that

809
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,120
too and we're also looking for anyone

810
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,880
who is interested

811
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,039
in presenting a webinar

812
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,480
as we'll schedule those in the coming

813
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,080
year

814
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,760
logan wilkins

815
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,520
francesco desrae and i have been working

816
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,919
on the timing metrics this is one of the

817
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,320
projects that we did record as a webinar

818
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,240
so if you're interested in more detail

819
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,279
about it

820
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,120
there's a it's just short of an hour but

821
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,679
we recorded this a couple years ago

822
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,760
and basically what we've done is come up

823
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,240
with seven kind of discrete moments in

824
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,200
time that happen for

825
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,360
many types of uh computer security

826
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,440
incidents and looking at these different

827
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,440
moments and coming up with uh

828
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,600
definitions for those and the difference

829
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,440
between any two of these

830
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,919
uh multiple moments in time

831
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,720
to use for metrics related purposes

832
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,880
and we're building uh some additional

833
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,640
documentation for these so here's an

834
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,880
example it's a work in progress where

835
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,640
we're coming up with more formal

836
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,880
descriptions of these different uh

837
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,799
timing metrics and how they can be

838
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,399
useful for uh response teams another

839
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,640
project we're currently working on is uh

840
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,919
for those of you who are familiar with

841
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,480
the csearch services framework we're

842
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,880
using that kind of as a model a baseline

843
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,399
to

844
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,799
map those different services functions

845
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,880
and functions the different types of

846
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,039
activities which can then be useful for

847
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,760
uh metrics so we're currently

848
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,240
cattle trying to categorize and catalog

849
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,640
different types of metrics

850
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,200
we're interested if anyone has

851
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,960
we'd like to participate or join the

852
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,640
metrics sig we would welcome your

853
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,480
participation or input

854
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,720
as we're working through this process

855
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,919
and some of the things that we want to

856
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,720
do in follow-up to this particular task

857
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,679
is uh again write more

858
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,840
explicit descriptions about what each of

859
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,240
these different metrics are these could

860
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,960
be useful for a checklist for teams that

861
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,720
are trying to put together uh ways to

862
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,559
assess or evaluate their own

863
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,000
effectiveness in the different parts of

864
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,399
the incident management life cycle and

865
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,120
also identify uh how this may be mapped

866
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,440
to other existing resources that are

867
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,039
already out there

868
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,960
and as i mentioned we have had a number

869
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,039
of different web webinars over the years

870
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,720
two of these are recorded and again you

871
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,559
can view these if you're interested and

872
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,640
we're looking to schedule upcoming

873
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,000
webinars in the future in the coming

874
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,039
year

875
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,120
if you have any interest again you can

876
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,080
go to our the website click on the

877
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,240
join the sig link and would be happy to

878
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,480
have you participate with us

879
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,300
thank you

880
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:49,200
[Applause]

881
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,039
next we'll hear from the malware

882
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,480
analysis sig

883
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,200
andreasson olivier

884
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,480
so good morning everybody

885
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,039
yeah malware analysis i hope the title

886
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,519
speaks for itself we are interesting to

887
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,840
do everything that's related to malware

888
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,679
analysis

889
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,440
and some

890
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,240
words about the sick we have around 35

891
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,919
people some were joined after the sick

892
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,080
meeting this week here at the conference

893
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,600
which is quite nice to see that the

894
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,480
interest in malware analysis still

895
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,039
still up between the teams so we have

896
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,120
meetings every

897
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,120
every other week on friday

898
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,720
that's one of the point we saw at the

899
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,519
meeting here in the at the conference

900
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,919
that we have to look for a better time

901
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,760
slot or for different time slots because

902
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,519
it's very difficult to find one time

903
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,440
slot which suits for

904
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,000
teams all around the world

905
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,080
the attendance is quite low so usually

906
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,240
we are only three to four people but i

907
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,120
think when we can manage to update the

908
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,080
the

909
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,480
the um

910
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,720
how we work together and maybe we have

911
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,039
some shared task list and it would be

912
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,440
easier for other people to join the sick

913
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,919
and help

914
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,560
fulfilling our work so our tools usually

915
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,800
we use the amnesia portal the confluence

916
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,480
portal from

917
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,560
from first and we also have a slack

918
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,239
channel which is

919
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,639
more and more used between the teams and

920
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,199
the mailing list will disappear maybe

921
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,159
within one or two years

922
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,079
so what are our projects we have the

923
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,239
malware analysis framework which is now

924
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,520
ready in a

925
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,879
version

926
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,199
1.0 which will

927
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,520
be published soon then we want to also

928
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,000
update the first web page regarding the

929
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,480
tools there is a quite an outstated list

930
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
of tools which you could use for doing

931
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,119
malware analysis and our goal is to

932
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,000
update this list and maybe also add some

933
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,399
examples how you can use a specific tool

934
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,359
to solve a specific task

935
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,280
and these results should be

936
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,280
published soon we hope that they will be

937
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,240
ready

938
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,119
within two or three months

939
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,720
so what is the malware analysis

940
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,079
framework

941
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,320
a lot of organizations and especially

942
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,160
sister teams are looking for these

943
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,920
capabilities and

944
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,560
good malware analysis are extremely

945
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,200
difficult to find or too expensive

946
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,680
so one of the point is get the most

947
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,680
for your bucks not all teams have the

948
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,839
same budget no not all teams have the

949
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,839
same resources but i think if you ask

950
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,079
the right questions you can then even

951
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,200
find

952
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,520
the answers to these questions

953
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,720
and you can even set up a small malware

954
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,240
lab with uh not a big budget but you can

955
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,520
out there you can already

956
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,599
solve a lot of tasks that you can help

957
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,280
your team or your organizations to

958
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,000
protect itself regard

959
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,320
regarding malware

960
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,000
what are our plans so we want to

961
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,440
increase the number of active

962
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,440
participants as i

963
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,599
said it's quite difficult

964
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,720
regarding the time zones and how we can

965
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,280
work better together then we also want

966
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,079
to

967
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,920
have regular

968
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,240
updates on the deliverers on our

969
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,520
deliverables

970
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,240
and especially want to keep them up to

971
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,160
date because the current

972
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,400
web page from our sig is quite outdated

973
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,200
and the goal is to have an updated page

974
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,240
every

975
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,800
now and then so we can improve also the

976
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,880
quality

977
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,680
okay

978
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,560
thank you for your attention and

979
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,930
enjoy the rest of today

980
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:34,960
[Applause]

981
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,880
next we'll hear from the

982
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,359
ethics sign

983
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,320
good morning um

984
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,200
the ethics sig has been a little bit

985
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,920
dormant the past two years

986
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,520
we

987
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,359
we launched the ethicsfirst.org

988
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,680
page where we listed the the code of

989
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,599
ethics

990
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,680
we had some very positive feedback on

991
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,760
that

992
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,640
and we started to work on an uh an

993
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,200
education kind of document that helps

994
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,440
explain these uh different duties that

995
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,760
have been identified

996
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,079
we've been working on that but um the

997
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,560
the progress stalled a little bit and uh

998
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,599
the the virtu the physical meeting here

999
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,920
has been very helpful in getting things

1000
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,400
going again

1001
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,280
the many of the members met up

1002
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,000
and we have some new energy now to just

1003
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,160
continue work on this

1004
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,040
we have a new co-chair also

1005
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,280
um uh so it's

1006
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,800
the the

1007
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,240
work has been done mostly by uh the the

1008
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,960
group has been led by by sean richardson

1009
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,359
and myself and tom milar is now also

1010
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,520
joining as a co-chair

1011
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,680
the plan is to

1012
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,680
to restart the work

1013
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,119
on the education document

1014
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,359
with a goal to finish that

1015
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,440
at the end of this year

1016
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,880
then

1017
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,880
have some professional editing services

1018
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,520
go over that document uh to finalize it

1019
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,760
and so that we have it uh ready for next

1020
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,520
year's conference

1021
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,680
uh and then we'll see where we can go

1022
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,119
from there maybe

1023
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,760
become dormant for a while while we

1024
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,920
await the response of these documents

1025
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,359
if there's any interest of course you

1026
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,880
can always join

1027
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,359
using the first portal we very much

1028
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,520
welcome new members

1029
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,560
to hear from their experiences to have

1030
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,720
feedback on the document

1031
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,640
or to just to hear that it's been very

1032
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,240
helpful to you

1033
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,479
thanks

1034
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,599
next we'll hear from mary kay with the

1035
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,599
iep

1036
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,640
good morning everyone

1037
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,440
so um i'll be talking and give an update

1038
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,839
on the information exchange policy sig

1039
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,000
um there's three co-chairs myself

1040
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,800
medical ko terry mcdonald and paul

1041
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,200
mckittrick

1042
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,839
the goal of the sig was to create a

1043
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,640
framework to make it easier to automate

1044
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,560
information sharing

1045
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,480
and

1046
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,560
we've also been somewhat dormant for the

1047
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,200
last year and a half but we have renewed

1048
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,040
energy and want to continue some of the

1049
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,599
work that had been started over the last

1050
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,920
couple of years

1051
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,079
so the work that has been completed is

1052
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,400
that we have an iep

1053
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,040
version 2.0

1054
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,119
that was completed in november 2019

1055
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,160
it basically creates a framework where

1056
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,119
you have four different policy types

1057
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,240
for handling information sharing what

1058
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,119
action you can take

1059
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,880
what some of the policies are around

1060
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,119
sharing that's based on the tlp the

1061
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,960
traffic-like protocol

1062
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,240
and then licensing policies

1063
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,119
and so we have created the policies at

1064
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,720
this point in time

1065
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,880
and when we're looking at the work that

1066
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,599
is in progress or that we have been

1067
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,680
meaning to start

1068
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,800
one of the main uh

1069
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,000
projects is to incorporate iep into

1070
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,760
sticks and taxi

1071
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,280
so since six 2.1 has been ratified and

1072
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,040
iep 2.0 has been ratified we wanted to

1073
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,160
start work in getting iep 2.0

1074
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,240
incorporated into sticks 2.2

1075
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,599
we also wanted to promote iep policy use

1076
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,000
and that work has been started

1077
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,680
we have created a couple of uh samples

1078
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,960
iep policy files and they can be found

1079
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,119
in the um

1080
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,240
in the urls listed there

1081
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,400
and basically that's to help create a

1082
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,119
suite of standards to enable

1083
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,839
to reuse iep policy files

1084
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,920
that will cover most of the threat

1085
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,319
intelligence sharing situation in use

1086
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,560
today and obviously that will evolve

1087
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,800
over time

1088
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,280
one of the pieces of work also that has

1089
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,079
had

1090
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,560
considerable discussion and has been of

1091
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,720
interest especially from some of the

1092
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,079
legal folks

1093
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,119
is to also create some standard legal

1094
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,319
language

1095
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,400
to match the policies

1096
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,400
and on and off we've had discussions

1097
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,240
around this but this is work that we'd

1098
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,000
really like to start

1099
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,400
and some of the membership of the sig

1100
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,680
are from from various legal counsel

1101
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,760
much like some other sigs you do not

1102
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,040
have to be a first member to participate

1103
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,119
and so we're hoping that we can start

1104
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,400
that work in parallel as we also try and

1105
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,920
incorporate the iep into the stixx taxi

1106
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,119
standards

1107
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,240
and create some of the the iep policies

1108
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,040
we've also always had

1109
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,960
some thought to

1110
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,599
future work where we want to create

1111
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:28,640
a

1112
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,040
basically a selector website to make it

1113
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,240
easier

1114
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,480
for somebody to figure out which

1115
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,720
licenses do you you know can you

1116
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,480
actually utilize

1117
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,240
um so that

1118
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,200
it will make it easier uh to try and

1119
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,280
figure out what policy is right for you

1120
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,280
when you're actually sharing information

1121
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,839
with a specific entity

1122
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:52,720
and also be able to create some

1123
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,680
mechanism to enable taxi to use the

1124
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,359
requirements from the information

1125
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,560
exchange policy framework to our auto

1126
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,040
enroll new sharing partners so that's

1127
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,359
work that we envision will happen over

1128
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,480
the next year or two

1129
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,599
so we did have a meeting on monday

1130
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,000
and from the participants

1131
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,079
there was definitely a renewed vigor and

1132
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,520
energy

1133
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,520
there was agreement that the work in

1134
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,839
progress should be continued and some of

1135
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,240
the envisioned work to be started should

1136
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,760
should

1137
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,079
should evolve

1138
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,800
there was a discussion that there might

1139
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,960
be some enhancements needed to iep 2.0

1140
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,880
and that's also due to some of the

1141
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,520
changes that are happening in tlp and

1142
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,240
some other considerations as people who

1143
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,000
are sharing information

1144
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,760
have looked at what the framework

1145
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,359
currently

1146
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,280
consists of

1147
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,760
there's also work to coordinate with

1148
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,760
other industry efforts

1149
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,920
and see there's a typo in there ansi

1150
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,520
should have two s's

1151
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,400
but the ansi pap which is a another

1152
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,400
sharing uh policy and there's going to

1153
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,280
be a session today at 10 15 on that so

1154
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,040
we'll find out more information as to

1155
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,640
what exactly that is

1156
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,640
but also work that's being done with the

1157
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,680
apwg is they're creating policies for

1158
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,599
sharing and have created policies for

1159
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,839
sharing and potentially what mog is

1160
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:18,720
doing

1161
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,240
because one of the things that we want

1162
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,640
to make sure of is that

1163
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,480
you know we don't want frameworks that

1164
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,319
are similar but different

1165
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,520
right we want them to all all agree

1166
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,359
so that we don't create more confusion

1167
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,040
in the industry

1168
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,160
so

1169
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,000
anybody that's interested in joining

1170
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,560
this sig also if you go to the first.org

1171
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,640
web page and look to the left panel with

1172
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,319
all the sigs i just click on the iep sig

1173
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,200
and uh and i'll click the join button

1174
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,839
and we would welcome more participation

1175
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,400
another comment i wanted to make is that

1176
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,760
when we when we created the iep 1.0 and

1177
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,200
2.0

1178
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,680
this sig actually the co-chairs decided

1179
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,880
to have two separate meetings on on the

1180
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,599
same day and that was to take into

1181
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,560
account the geographic diversity

1182
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,040
um that created a lot of onus on the

1183
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,119
co-chairs and will probably in the

1184
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,240
future create more consistent uh like

1185
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,040
one meeting for whatever time frame and

1186
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,280
then also start using email or slack

1187
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,400
more

1188
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,550
anyway thank you

1189
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:29,989
[Applause]

1190
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,920
is art here with the vulnerability

1191
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,560
coordination sight

1192
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,280
uh good morning everyone so i'm art

1193
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,480
manion

1194
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,720
at the cert coordination center i am at

1195
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,560
least one of the co-chairs of both of

1196
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,240
these cigs

1197
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,359
this will be fairly short

1198
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:00,400
i'll start with vulnerability

1199
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,480
coordination sig so as you can see we've

1200
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,200
been on a sort of a quasi-hiatus status

1201
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,440
uh before the pandemic even

1202
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,400
um the discussion and the and the

1203
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,839
agreement was

1204
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,240
we were going to keep the sig active we

1205
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,720
meet roughly quarterly

1206
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,240
and have a mailing list just to see if

1207
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,000
there's any activity or anyone wants to

1208
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,160
pick up any new work but

1209
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,280
we felt it worth keeping the cigs open

1210
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,640
but we're not going to hold meetings if

1211
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,319
there's nothing sort of to work on and

1212
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,240
spend anybody's time

1213
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,720
um so the the primary discussion we had

1214
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,160
an in-person meeting this week took

1215
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,599
advantage of the

1216
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,680
of the option here

1217
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,599
and the main question is do the

1218
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,200
membership does the membership want to

1219
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,640
pick up any new work

1220
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,240
and ideas are great we've got a list

1221
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,319
started we had a good discussion

1222
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,680
we'll follow that up with our mailing

1223
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,119
list for folks who are not able to be

1224
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,720
present

1225
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,240
but right interest is great but

1226
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,000
commitment is part of the part of the

1227
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,599
volunteer community effort so we'll see

1228
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,640
where that where that leads us

1229
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,880
and just a summary of some of the topics

1230
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,000
that that

1231
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,680
seem to be maybe the the leading

1232
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,359
contenders for this sig should we pick

1233
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:06,720
up new work

1234
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,160
there's been some discussion about

1235
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,119
national regulation uh and laws that

1236
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,599
impact our our world in coordinated

1237
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,280
vulnerability disclosure

1238
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,680
um there have only become you know more

1239
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,920
and more either direct or indirect

1240
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,000
uh national international

1241
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,599
law and regulation that touch on touch

1242
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:25,359
on cvd

1243
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,240
both positively and perhaps causing some

1244
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,000
bumps

1245
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,800
we've

1246
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,880
this is not a new item but

1247
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,040
there's been discussion of

1248
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,480
in the vulnerability scanning and

1249
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,040
management world a scanner lights up and

1250
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,280
says you have a thing to fix

1251
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,800
and maybe that's not the case after

1252
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,800
further investigation

1253
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,960
this causes a lot of work perhaps an

1254
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,520
efficient use of use of resources

1255
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,960
and we had a discussion which is also

1256
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,119
not a new one but what

1257
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,359
how might we handle uh shall we say

1258
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,440
uncooperative parties

1259
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,079
during a multi-party coordination uh bit

1260
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,839
of work

1261
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,200
the sig's existing work is on the

1262
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,559
first.org website also it's easy to as

1263
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:07,760
others have mentioned you can scroll

1264
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,079
down the left down to the v's

1265
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:11,359
find this sig

1266
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,040
and sign up there

1267
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,440
we welcome all membership

1268
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,280
because this sig has published a

1269
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,720
document

1270
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,880
we do uh follow vr excuse me follow the

1271
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,520
ipr regulation

1272
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,480
because we published published some work

1273
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,319
so i'm going to do the two for one here

1274
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,160
and cover the other v they're both for

1275
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,480
vulnerability of course

1276
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,920
vrdx thing

1277
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,559
um again quasi quasi-dormant um

1278
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,960
even pre-pandemic

1279
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,800
we

1280
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,160
don't don't have any active work and

1281
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,680
don't want to burn each other's time

1282
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,200
doing nothing

1283
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,040
same question is there any interest in

1284
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,800
picking up new work interest and

1285
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,480
commitment

1286
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,520
and again we'll follow up with the

1287
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,119
mailing list for folks who are not not

1288
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,839
present this week

1289
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:03,520
we have a bit of existing work

1290
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,040
we've published a

1291
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,119
vulnerability database catalog this is

1292
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:08,720
now

1293
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,680
three or four years stale

1294
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,200
we've had a couple of requests on and

1295
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,880
off you know will we update it the

1296
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,800
answer so far has been no but we're

1297
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,559
going to have a sig discussion and

1298
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,720
decide what to do with that leave it as

1299
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,960
is update it and maintain it or possibly

1300
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,079
remove it

1301
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,200
a fine idea at the time to list things

1302
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,880
there's some question as to the

1303
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,480
usefulness of maintaining

1304
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,000
maintaining that list in that catalog

1305
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:35,760
there's also a bit of work that keeps

1306
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,480
coming up as potentially useful

1307
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,160
this vxrex vxref excuse me work

1308
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,040
is essentially a way to relate

1309
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,440
between vulnerability identifiers so if

1310
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,160
you have a cve is very common

1311
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,640
and you have a gsd id or a red hat

1312
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,960
security advisory id

1313
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,400
the theory is that it would be great to

1314
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,319
be able to relate those together in the

1315
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:00,319
same way we're not trying to

1316
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,319
create a new id system and claim that

1317
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:03,680
it's the best one in the entire world

1318
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,319
should use just one we don't expect that

1319
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:09,040
can we relate multiple id systems

1320
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,720
together in the same way

1321
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,960
which would enable some information

1322
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,319
transfer

1323
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:16,640
and again scroll down to v it's possible

1324
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,160
to join there

1325
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,000
both of these sigs we have again this

1326
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,319
philosophy of we're not going to

1327
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,839
burn a lot of time unless we have work

1328
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:24,640
to do

1329
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,000
and over the next couple weeks we'll

1330
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,839
have some discussions and

1331
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,680
see if that is the case

1332
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,200
so that's it thank you

1333
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:37,359
[Applause]

1334
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:40,480
so next is the automation sig

1335
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,920
david and

1336
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,920
aaron

1337
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,200
okay

1338
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,000
so this is the next one okay all right

1339
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
so it's uh david is david here

1340
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,920
nope okay

1341
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,160
so

1342
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,440
basically what's the automation sig it's

1343
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,319
a discussion sig um

1344
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,200
on all topics concerning automation

1345
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,079
in the context of incident response

1346
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:25,359
forensics

1347
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:26,960
cyber threat intelligence etc so

1348
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,240
basically everything

1349
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,240
cyber related however

1350
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,520
you know if you take a look at the word

1351
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,040
automation it's rather large

1352
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,839
the first idea here is that we exchange

1353
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,520
uh knowledge

1354
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,920
documented and we can uh especially

1355
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,400
learn a lot from from each other by

1356
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,839
sharing success and the failure stories

1357
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,880
um

1358
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,880
one of the you know most visible

1359
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,440
outcomes of the sig of this new sig

1360
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,280
will be a best practice document on

1361
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,559
automation

1362
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:57,680
so

1363
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,000
listing tools etc

1364
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,359
but also listing processes

1365
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,200
so why

1366
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,280
um in this community

1367
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,720
since years everyone is talking about

1368
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,240
information sharing

1369
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,240
but i believe that you know you cannot

1370
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,079
only share information

1371
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,079
that is very valuable but you also have

1372
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,400
to share the tools to process it

1373
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,880
without the tools you know

1374
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,960
people will just get flooded and

1375
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,440
they will just shut shut off

1376
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,440
and the other reason for automation is

1377
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,880
that many teams see like an overload

1378
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,440
with their themes and their alerts and

1379
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,440
so we have the concept of alert fatigue

1380
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,880
now

1381
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,880
people you know also switch off so we

1382
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,119
need automation for that

1383
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,440
um how did that happen

1384
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,440
at my current workplace we were looking

1385
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,319
at sword tools

1386
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,520
and

1387
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,520
we were pretty much in the same or are

1388
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,400
still in the same same position where

1389
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,640
like like in wendy's keynote um she

1390
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,079
asked like i'm the new see so what

1391
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,640
should i buy right

1392
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,359
or for us more what should we reuse

1393
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,400
maybe existing stuff

1394
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,800
or buy or build

1395
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,960
so the next question was like what do

1396
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,520
others do well that's how the idea came

1397
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,000
up with uh david and benoit

1398
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,440
that we should reach out to the first

1399
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,040
community and ask like what are you

1400
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,079
doing

1401
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:21,599
what are your success stories what are

1402
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,440
your failure stories

1403
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,400
and

1404
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,400
that's how the sake came to be

1405
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,480
i think we started in march this year so

1406
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,559
it's rather new

1407
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,400
yeah

1408
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,559
so here's the mission

1409
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,160
shortened slightly but you can also see

1410
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,599
it on the web page

1411
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:39,760
provide a forum for exchanging of this

1412
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,839
information documenting that knowledge

1413
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:43,839
that we talk about

1414
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:47,680
compile a list of tools for automation

1415
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,280
best practices

1416
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,400
and

1417
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,240
cooperate with similar groups which are

1418
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,319
usually small at talk

1419
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:55,920
especially in our communities there

1420
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,680
there are quite a few developers of

1421
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,680
these tools that's also very interesting

1422
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,400
to cooperate with those groups

1423
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,880
okay so where are we standing um

1424
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,920
we have our document that you can read

1425
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,720
in

1426
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,119
confluence in the wiki space

1427
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,559
of first

1428
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,960
i said we started in march we have

1429
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,599
roughly one call per um

1430
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,640
per month so you know that's at that

1431
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,000
speed yeah

1432
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,720
don't expect a full document yet we have

1433
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,760
um

1434
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,359
but we have a structure where we want to

1435
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,440
go to we have initial chapters

1436
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,079
and yesterday we had a packed room of

1437
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:33,760
people interested in in the automation

1438
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,240
stick so i do hope that we'll get

1439
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,280
some some additional movement here so

1440
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,319
pretty interes

1441
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,960
pretty high level of interest actually

1442
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,000
um

1443
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,280
so here let me jump ahead nope sorry

1444
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,119
that's back

1445
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,960
how do i go back okay

1446
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,839
um okay i had in a different slide i had

1447
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:56,960
um the um the list of the the chapters

1448
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,040
but roughly it revolves around this use

1449
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,359
cases playbooks yeah uh we want to

1450
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:03,359
document the the most relevant playbooks

1451
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,920
or use cases for for automation for in

1452
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,079
our in our community

1453
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:09,920
um so that when you read the document

1454
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,680
you can see okay well i have something

1455
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,319
similar is maybe not exactly the same

1456
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:15,760
but

1457
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,960
it's good enough

1458
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,520
to take a look and learn from the others

1459
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,440
then list of tools and what they can do

1460
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,359
sort of you know the typical evaluation

1461
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:24,880
matrix

1462
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,359
standards which are useful in this area

1463
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,520
like a playbook standard like cacao for

1464
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,839
example

1465
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,920
and then basically have it have two

1466
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,400
chapters one for open source tools where

1467
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,359
the open source tools oops sorry

1468
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:42,880
okay good to wake you up in the morning

1469
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,079
it was by accident

1470
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,400
so how the open source tools implement

1471
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,040
that specific uh playbook

1472
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,200
and uh then we'll reach out to the

1473
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,440
vendors because luckily we have lots of

1474
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,079
vendors in this community uh so we will

1475
00:55:58,079 --> 00:55:59,920
basically reach out to them and say

1476
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,599
how would you implement that in your

1477
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,599
closed source so basically everyone

1478
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:04,880
who's reading that document has a

1479
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,119
comparison and they can they can you

1480
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:09,680
know see how this would work for them

1481
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,760
and then they take that and adapt it

1482
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,040
that's the idea

1483
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,920
so that's pretty much it yeah we want

1484
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,839
your input we need your input especially

1485
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:19,200
on the playbooks

1486
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,720
that would be really really valuable

1487
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:23,839
and

1488
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,640
how to participate the usual way sign up

1489
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,880

00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,599
directly you don't for this seek you

1491
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:32,960
don't have to be a first member because

1492
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,640
we want to reach out to a wider

1493
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,440
community thank you

1494
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,760
okay

1495
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,200
what's the next one

1496
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,200
so

1497
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,040
thank you all for joining the updates

1498
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,400
from the special interest groups

1499
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,119
unfortunately we are out of time uh for

1500
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:53,920
any more uh updates but their slides

1501
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,520
will be on uh the app and there are also

1502
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,799
two video presentations from from two of

1503
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:01,760
the other

1504
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,079
sigs that you can view on the app as

1505
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:05,839
well and if you're looking for a way to

1506
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,160
become involved in the first community

1507
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,640
the uh the cigs are a great way to start

1508
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,400
so please be sure to check them out on

1509
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,690
