43
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,560
pure

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,960

as well as a botnet and malwa networks

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,520
which he likes to disrupt

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,360
and then

51
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,520

d costa yes

53
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,680
dave decosta is the internet spelunker

54
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,560
for the shadow server foundation and has

55
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,360
been involved in the internet security

56
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,000
for over 20 years

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,400
when he's not scanning the internet he

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,400
can find him doing things not online

59
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,840
so

60
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,080
the title is

61
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,160
internet spelunking

62
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,280
ipv6 scanning and device fingerprint

63
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,400
printing

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,360
so the stage is yours okay um hello

65
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,560
everyone

66
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,879
uh it's great to be back giving talks in

67
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,440
person again um the talk is about

68
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,360
internet spelunking so essentially our

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,760
scanning and how we uncover new strange

70
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,319
objects uh exposed on the internet

71
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,560
the talk will be given by two of us uh

72
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,120
uh together with my my colleague uh dave

73
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,560
decoster

74
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,640
um a very quick intro shadow server is a

75
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,560
non-profit uh working to make the

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,879
internet a more secure for all which is

77
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,560
kind of like an ever never-ending task

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,280
it's an american and dutch non-profit

79
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,720
foundation

80
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,959
we've been around for for for

81
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,599
15 years and we our mission is

82
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,760
essentially to

83
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,040
share information with internet

84
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,280
defenders at no cost to mitigate

85
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,120
vulnerable vulnerabilities detect

86
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,840
malicious activity encounter emerging

87
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,280
threats we do this for free we don't

88
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,879
sell anything

89
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,400
we are funded exclusively through

90
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,879
sponsorships grants and donations

91
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,200
and if you are able to support us in any

92
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,120
way we would very much appreciate it if

93
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,200
you like if of course you you like our

94
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,959
work we are about to launch a shadow

95
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,799
server alliance uh of a group of

96
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,799
like-minded organizations

97
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,680
uh as a way to ensuring our future um

98
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,439
stability from the financial perspective

99
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,439
as well so we've been around for a long

100
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,080
time and we are probably the world's

101
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,400
largest provider of free cyber threat

102
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,920
intelligence

103
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,400
we collect a lot of data sets um this is

104
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,560
data sets scanning we scan the internet

105
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,840
and that's really the subject of the

106
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,399
talk but we also sinkhole disrupt a lot

107
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,440
of um

108
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,918
botnet malware or other

109
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,040
uh uh malicious uh cyber crime and some

110
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,560
sometimes state

111
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,360
uh activities with and we disrupt and

112
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,960
take over um

113
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,320
the command control infrastructure

114
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,520
either through

115
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,680
a court order working together with law

116
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,080
enforcement or with industry

117
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,160
we also run vast honeypot sensor

118
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,199
networks

119
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,600
uh in thousands of locations worldwide

120
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,160
uh we run a big malware repository

121
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,240
that's comparable to to any antivirus

122
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,800
vendor with 1.7 billion unique malware

123
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,960
samples by hash and then all in all we

124
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,280
have 12 petabytes of storage

125
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,600
of various types of information that we

126
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,560
collect

127
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,479
and what we do with all of this is that

128
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,000
we share this for free

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,240
with the community so if if you're a

130
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
national c-cert you get the data that we

131
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,560
see every day for your country if you're

132
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,800
internet service provider you get data

133
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,560
for your network network every day if

134
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
you're a corporation or an sme or

135
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,240
university and you signed up with us you

136
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,560
can get our data there for free

137
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,800
um every single day so if you haven't

138
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,479
subscribed to our services please do and

139
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,720
there is no no catch here you really get

140
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,600
data for free and

141
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,440
we hope you do something good with it we

142
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,720
also use the data to support law

143
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,960
enforcement operations like we work

144
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,120
together with the fbi europol

145
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,199
and many other national national

146
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,479
agencies and long-term multi-year cyber

147
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,960
crime analysis and take down

148
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,599
operations

149
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,120
so the focus today is about our scanning

150
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,880
dave will really talk about how we

151
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,800
actually do the scanning and

152
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,440
also uh how we how we got into ipv6

153
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,759
scanning and then at the end i'll just

154
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,680
to wrap up i'll take over and talk a bit

155
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,360
also about how we actually fingerprint

156
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,479
devices

157
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,120
um remotely thanks to all of this um

158
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,840
scanning

159
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,000
so thank you

160
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,880
so on average day we report 149 million

161
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,720
ipa addresses

162
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,479
that are these are unique ip addresses

163
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,080
that we find in our

164
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,440
in our data sets from the from the

165
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,880
scanning so

166
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,840
uh it's not a small number

167
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,600
so to get that number we do

168
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,240
approximately well 107 billion udp

169
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,000
probes 225 billion tcps uh sins and we

170
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,440
perform 407 million full handshakes and

171
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,520
those numbers are probably small but

172
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,600
close enough

173
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,520
so first the ground rules of how we do

174
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,520
our scanning

175
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,880
we make sure that our scans will not

176
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,720
compromise harm or degrade system

177
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,800
performance we always we will always

178
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
always always use the smallest most

179
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,560
minimal packet size possible to get our

180
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,479
results two reasons first of all we

181
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,360
don't want to make a mess of your

182
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,639
firewall and second of all it's more

183
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,599
economical for us to send small packets

184
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,400
and we will test we will never ever ever

185
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,800
ever take a packet or a probe and just

186
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,240
fire it across the internet blindly

187
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,919
we'll always make sure that it's tested

188
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,759
is tested in a uh in a private

189
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,840
environment in a live environment

190
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,840
it will always be tested and before we

191
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,520
even do a full scan we'll do what we

192
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,360
call one shard which is one two fiftieth

193
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,199
of the uh of the internet

194
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,639
and on top of that we will only scan

195
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,720
what is necessary for uh to get the

196
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,639
information that we need to let someone

197
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,479
remediate their system

198
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,680
well so

199
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,599
we also also look for specific ports

200
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,960
used for our criminal criminal

201
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,479
infrastructures which law enforcement

202
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,720
finds useful and our scans will never

203
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,440
ever ever break the u.s laws

204
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,960
that is your red line that we will not

205
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,880
cross

206
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,759
so

207
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,199
how did we get here

208
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,960
no deed goes and punished

209
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,560
we can all thank christian rashford for

210
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,160
publishing a very actually very good

211
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,599
paper um

212
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,680
but the problem is is that this opened

213
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,280
the door for people actually made it

214
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,800
easy for people to realize how to do

215
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,960
reflective ddos scanning

216
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,639
so we started with one of the protocols

217
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,400
out of i think there are 14 on the list

218
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,160
uh we sort of dns because people were

219
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,080
already doing it it was easy for us to

220
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,680
do and the miscreates were already

221
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,240
abusing it

222
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,520
and also allowed us to double check our

223
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,879
work

224
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,520
the first scan that we did it uh was

225
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,160
very bad code it took up 91 hours to

226
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,440
complete we found 16.9 million um dns

227
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,000
servers on port udp 53 and we found one

228
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,199
let's say 12 and a quarter million of

229
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,479
them to be openly recursive and

230
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,879
vulnerable for abuse

231
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,120
uh scan currently takes four hours and

232
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,800
we're down to six million total

233
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,640
responses and we have one point eight

234
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,440
million recursive resolvers that's now

235
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,799
that was a that was reduction of 10

236
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,039
million ips

237
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,640
great it worked

238
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,799
um so after we discovered that you know

239
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,040
this this wasn't just a terrible idea

240
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,959
with uh with a here hold my beer we

241
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,040
could do this uh we got more hardware

242
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,800
more bandwidth we wrote new tools so

243
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,640
that's how we got down to four hours and

244
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,240
we proceeded to implement scans on the

245
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,000
rest of the targets

246
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,320
and everything was great and then

247
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
somebody came along and discovered that

248
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,200
um

249
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,320
poodle

250
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,800
it was a very bad thing and we said we

251
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,880
were asked can you scan for uh do tcp

252
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,720
scans we said sure we can do tcp scans

253
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,480
discover that doing adp scans is a whole

254
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,120
lot easier um udp you know you spray

255
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,399
attack packet out there and you're good

256
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,080
to go and you don't really do much you

257
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,399
decode a pack you decode the packet and

258
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,680
life is happy

259
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,600
since it's tcp you have to do a sin scan

260
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,200
then you have to do a follow-up scan

261
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,120
afterwards and you also have to decode

262
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,640
the https

263
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,440
that's expensive compute wise

264
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,200
but it took us a bit but we were able to

265
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,080
do it

266
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,160
and november 2014 we sent out our first

267
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,760
report uh with

268
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,160
15.5 million ips that were vulnerable to

269
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,519
downgrade attack

270
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,920
nowadays we're down to 2.3 million it's

271
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,040
still big but it's getting better

272
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,959
but you know

273
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,720
we really couldn't let it just sit

274
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,800
because it's only 11 protocols and had a

275
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
very large pile of hardware so well we

276
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,800
added a few more scans

277
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,560
we are currently at 103 uh scans on ipv4

278
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,279
and we're at 10 on ipv6

279
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,120
and yes i realized that oh actually you

280
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,680
can read that

281
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,160
so

282
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,920
to choose our next targets

283
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,720
we

284
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,240
don't just throw it no actually though

285
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,680
sometimes we do we don't usually throw a

286
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,279
dart on a dartboard but

287
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,640
it's usually trying to be topical about

288
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,560
it if it's something that's interesting

289
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,800
uh so it's like one in the days before

290
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,560
netis with the uh net of spot and that

291
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,399
stuff and the amplification attacks

292
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,320
there who chose to do that

293
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,680
or things like

294
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,519
sinful knock where you wind up with the

295
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,440
uh with the nation's z implant or uh

296
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,640
benign certainty on isa kmp we started

297
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,240
looking for things like that

298
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,680
and we also look for legacy protocols

299
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,880
that shouldn't be exposed things like

300
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,040
you know telnet rsh things that just

301
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,480
don't have encryption

302
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,839
and also for current things that

303
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,000
shouldn't be exposed um you know

304
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,079
say mongodb kubernetes mysql uh redis

305
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,760
or the other reason actually it's

306
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,800
probably one of the biggest reasons

307
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,079
that's actually scanned for something is

308
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,160
someone actually asked us someone sent

309
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,519
us an email and said hey

310
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,640
do you know how many of these are out

311
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
there and usually we're a curious bunch

312
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,320
of folks so

313
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,440
we look

314
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,120
and sometimes you find good things

315
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,760
usually we find a lot of bad things

316
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,920
but for some fun facts

317
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,720
with daily repeats we have sent

318
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,600
209 trillion udp probes i updated this

319
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,040
this morning so it's probably pretty

320
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,800
close

321
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,800
221 trillion tcp sins

322
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,160
500 as we performed 508 full protocol

323
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,279
connections that means https uh just a

324
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,760
full full handshake there mongodb

325
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,240
anything anything along those lines and

326
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,640
we have sent

327
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,920
287 billion

328
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,479
services for

329
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,120
remediation apologize advance for the

330
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,079
noise

331
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,079
because well i'm sure i'm at everybody's

332
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,399
firewall if you've seen me that's me if

333
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,000
you're not then someone just look at you

334
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,320
for a little harder

335
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,079
so to get all this done we have a very

336
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,079
large rack of gear we are currently

337
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,000
scanning from 37 servers there's so

338
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,920
they're pancake a combination of pancake

339
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,600
boxes and

340
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,639
and blade servers we have two 10 gigabit

341
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,720
lines that get very rather heavily

342
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,760
abused

343
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,880
and we have five uh ipv4 say five slash

344
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,720
twenty six and one slash twenty four on

345
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,519
ipv4 and we perform scanning from one

346
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,800
one slash 64 ipv6 block

347
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,560
and these are probably the dirtiest

348
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,959
sliders on the net

349
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,360
uh the nodes are assigned 15 ipv4

350
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,920
addresses and 33 ipv6 addresses so that

351
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,920
we can bounce around a bit and we say

352
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,680
bounce strong within constraints

353
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,839
and at least make sure that we don't

354
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,000
that we don't trigger too many ids's

355
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,839
because we hit everything from one ip

356
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,320
the methodology that we use for scanning

357
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,399
the tcp scans are scanned differently

358
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,040
than udp scans our tcp scans are broken

359
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,240
into shards

360
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,920
the shard is one two fiftieths of the

361
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,079
internet and we randomly do a random

362
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,079
seed using zmapp

363
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,959
and uh we use the entire i'll say all uh

364
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,440
all 37 nodes to actually scan from

365
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,600
and those are performed using the using

366
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,240
pretty much open source software our udp

367
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,480
scans are monolithic which makes life

368
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,160
interesting

369
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,079
they are each each scan is run from a

370
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,519
from a single node and is performed

371
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,480
using custom software

372
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,839
oops

373
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,600
for our udp scans our custom software is

374
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,920
something named railgun mainly because

375
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,519
you know you throw one packet in there

376
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,760
and we send it out really fast so it's

377
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,279
designed to say this is designed to send

378
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,519
a single packet randomly really fast to

379
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,519
all 3.4 billion packets and tries to

380
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,600
randomize them as fast as possible is

381
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
tuned for doing small small payloads it

382
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,279
can do large payloads but it gets very

383
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,440
cranky

384
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,560
it will send packets using all 15 ipv

385
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
ipv4 addresses that we have available on

386
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,760
the box

387
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,440
but the only downside is is that it has

388
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,800
very few safety measures if you want to

389
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,399
shoot yourself on the foot it will take

390
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,480
your foot off

391
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,720
uh usually we can scan for the internet

392
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,040
in about four hours for for any given

393
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,120
packet uh something like isa kmp usually

394
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,480
takes about six just because of the

395
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,839
packet size

396
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,199
and it's also highly dependent on the

397
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,480
number of things that actually respond

398
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,399
to us or if somebody decides to detox us

399
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,880
in the middle of a scan then things take

400
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,720
much longer

401
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,120
the tcp scans are done by commodity

402
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,040
tools we do our we do our assignment

403
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,920
jobs using condor which is commonly used

404
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,399
in a in research environments

405
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,240
so we use that to farm up the jobs as

406
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,240
needed to boxes that are idle the actual

407
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,839
scannings are performed by z-map because

408
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,440
it does it does its job quite well very

409
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,839
quickly and we use z-grab or z-grab 2

410
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,600
for the for the back end for most of the

411
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,480
things

412
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,560
and we have a few other tools for doing

413
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,399
uh for doing custom scans just because

414
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,560
things get strange

415
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
or they require multi steps

416
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,560
uh each service takes between 10 minutes

417
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,120
and three hours depending if that's uh

418
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,959
the time is highly dependent depending

419
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,880
on the complexity of the scan things

420
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,279
that don't require uh cryptography like

421
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,440
telnet um sometimes

422
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,480
ftp but those take and human times takes

423
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,639
eight minutes eight minutes and end from

424
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,760
38 boxes and if on machine time it takes

425
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,360
3 hours and 57 minutes which isn't too

426
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,160
bad

427
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
but things with cryptography

428
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,519
the longest scan that we actually have

429
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,040
is https um that is much slower it

430
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,360
requires 2 hours and 29 minutes in human

431
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,279
time which equates to

432
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,519
full to uh say a full two work weeks so

433
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,279
82 hours of machine height

434
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,519
but the reason that https is so slow is

435
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,519
because that it is a uh it is a

436
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,680
combination of a straight up https scan

437
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,760
a uh scan for

438
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,600
say ssl v3

439
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,240
tls version 1.3

440
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,560
we're looking for uh this for export

441
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,079
ciphers using that's what's called the

442
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,360
freak scan

443
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,000
and we're also looking for excel looking

444
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,920
for exchange servers and it's also a

445
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,360
portion of the kubernetes scans that we

446
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,160
do

447
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,880
which is why it's so long

448
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,360
and then after after things are run the

449
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,240
data is all parsed we check for protocol

450
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,399
specificity we send any check to make

451
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,839
sure that nobody's throwing bad data at

452
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,440
us however if somebody decides to spoof

453
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,440
data at us and sends it at

454
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,240
that

455
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,000
in ways that are actually protocol uh

456
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,240
compliant that causes issues sometimes

457
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,480
but we have solutions for that too

458
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,320
everything is normalized and it shipped

459
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,519
off for the data center to get turned

460
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,440
into reports

461
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,480
so

462
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,839
we have frameworks for dealing with

463
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,959
pretty much for ipv scans ipv4 scans

464
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,560
that make it pretty easy for us to spin

465
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,839
things up

466
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,519
everything was going swimmingly until

467
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,560
one day

468
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,320
goes

469
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,040
we have a we want to scan ipv6

470
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,959
and my first response i think

471
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,920
was actually and i quote are you nuts

472
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,639
he says no no no we have an idea

473
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,440
an idea he did have

474
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,560
so after a bunch of research um ipv6 is

475
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
like just like ipv4 there's a lot more

476
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,839
of it but not quite it's a little quirky

477
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,920
um you can't really set it from end to

478
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,320
end so we use uh we use queries and

479
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,600
curated lists where we source them from

480
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,079
ssl ssl certificates hitlist and other

481
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,079
places and we are currently scanning

482
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,519
about 814 million ipv4 ipv6 addresses

483
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,120
that we have determined are fully

484
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,199
actually currently in use

485
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,720
if we would want to actually blindly

486
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,919
scan the ipv6 space um it's highly

487
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,640
unfeasible since ipv6 space is 3.48

488
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,039
times 10 to 38 unique addresses it's

489
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,959
time to scan it would be roughly 2 times

490
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,559
10 to 250 years

491
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,199
way longer than i have patience for

492
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,439
so we use curated lists we're using uh

493
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,119
we're using passive dns records from

494
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,480
some of our partners that share data

495
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,359
with us

496
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,359
and we're using the ipv6 hit list from

497
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,200
the uh from the ipv6 hit list.github.io

498
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
certificate transparency seams sinkholes

499
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,120
and other partners and if you have more

500
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,280
data we'd love it

501
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,000
the

502
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,840
differences are that v4 v6 um you have

503
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
to use a different tool because one

504
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,200
created by the technical university

505
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,720
yeah

506
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
they have a zmap version that does ipv6

507
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,320
it does a great job

508
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,559
z graph and z grab 2 have native ipv6

509
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,400
support which is awesome

510
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,120
but there are other tools out there

511
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,880
yeah they don't exist

512
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,559
it has the uh we suffer the same problem

513
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,760
that every other security vendor has um

514
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,600
where the tooling for uh for instant

515
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,200
responders and defenders just doesn't

516
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,240
exist in ipv6 spaces uh so that's why i

517
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,760
feel if you uh if you have to receive a

518
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,600
report you'll notice that the ipv6 data

519
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,840
does not contain things like uh like the

520
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,799
tls version 1.3 uh scans because

521
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,480
while i can do it i do not have a tool

522
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,600
to do it fast yet

523
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,440
um the other problem problem is that

524
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,600
ipv6 scanning is much slower we have to

525
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,760
do much more general timings than ipv4

526
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,520
we can't just slam pack us out and

527
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,360
hopefully get stuff back

528
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,679
ipv4 we've tested that the

529
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,520
when we're using zmap the

530
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,200
potential packet loss begins at about

531
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,919
half a million packets but we use ipv6

532
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,600
the potential packet loss begins at

533
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,240
about 100 000 packets the reason for

534
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,799
this is just surely the packet size um

535
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,799
the default the minimum packet size you

536
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,840
can actually have an ipv6 is

537
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,520
1280 bytes if you remember correctly

538
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
which is uh substantially larger than

539
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,520
ipv4 so the processing time to actually

540
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,280
send it route it get it back and do

541
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,200
something with it is just causing that

542
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,160
just causes much more overhead

543
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,480
likewise if we're using uh confusing

544
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,039
concurrent senders to actually you know

545
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,120
actually us like splay our splayer scans

546
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,360
and actually do things multiple times at

547
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,080
once ipv4 we can do about 30 we can test

548
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,840
about 35 000 ips a single time ipv6 once

549
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,440
again we have the same problem with the

550
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,880
packet overhead where we start losing

551
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,960
data at about 15 at about 1500

552
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,720
the average number of ips that we could

553
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,039
actually process we can process

554
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,720
roughly a quarter million ips a second

555
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,200
with ipv4 but once again we've we see

556
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
that our speeds are dropped by about

557
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,039
probably a fifth let's say we're talking

558
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,960
to about a fifth to about 58 000 ips per

559
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,000
second

560
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,360
it's doable but

561
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,160
it's

562
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,559
annoying

563
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,840
and the other interesting thing is that

564
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,799
even though they're using different

565
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,919
protocol stacks ipv4 and ipv6 scans do

566
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,600
not like running auth running at the

567
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
same time on the same network interface

568
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,159
your machine will hate you trust me

569
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,240
uh to get around this we have uh we're

570
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,600
actually running routing those on

571
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,000
separate ip addresses and separate vlan

572
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,919
spaces that that route back into the

573
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,720
same network

574
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,520
our current ipv6 scans we're doing ssl

575
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,039
smtp telnet ssh http a couple ports

576
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,280
mysql ftp and postgres

577
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,039
and the responses

578
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,400
are sizeable

579
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,080
the biggest uh the biggest surprise

580
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,360
actually was http and uh

581
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,520
http being so large that one in eight

582
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,600
ips that we actually scan responds with

583
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,720
http

584
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,000
and when we look at the packet header

585
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,159
that the uh the page that we get back a

586
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,600
lot of them actually appear to be just

587
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,000
default pages so the best that we can

588
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,080
figure out is that

589
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,600
people are firewalling themselves from

590
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,280
ipv4 and they don't realize they have

591
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,840
ipv6 services running

592
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,320
mysql is so large there's one there's

593
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,559
one vendor that has a uh

594
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,200
that has a that has mysql up here

595
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,080
apparently uh enabled on every every vps

596
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,679
that they have we're not sure why we've

597
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,760
contacted them and

598
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,960
haven't gotten any answers back

599
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,120
but some other interesting information

600
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,320
observations that we can make from the

601
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,520
ipv6 scans is that with ssl

602
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,600
the things that ipv6 have

603
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,120
much better security on them there's

604
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,120
very very very very few things that

605
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,200
actually have uh the really old ciphers

606
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,080
so

607
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
it's not common that when we run a when

608
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,000
we're in scans for uh for poodle for

609
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,760
poodle that we actually come back and

610
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,840
don't see a single one usually we see

611
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,679
one maybe two maybe three per day but

612
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:34,960
that's it

613
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,600
um on ftp we're actually see greater say

614
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,280
greater adoption of encryption

615
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,440
finally

616
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,960
and my sql the other interesting thing

617
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,400
that we find that with the the one thing

618
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,000
that we find is that 42 percent of the

619
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,200
hosts um that have mysql running

620
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,360
they actually have some variety of acl

621
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,559
or block list

622
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,640
but on four but only four percent of the

623
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,960
same hosts on ipv6 actually have block

624
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,280
lists

625
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,120
as we look we'll get our population

626
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,480
scans we have

627
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,400
with the bulk of the in use we'll say

628
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,240
what's called in use ipv6 is we don't

629
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,000
really know exactly how much there has

630
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,400
actually assigned versus usage but our

631
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,240
best guess is that i say the the bulk of

632
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,080
the ipv6 usage is actually done perform

633
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,320
in the united states followed by denmark

634
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,440
germany and then the netherlands

635
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,880
however if we looked at the things that

636
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,480
are that we consider exposed or

637
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,240
vulnerable leaders still the united

638
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,440
states

639
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,799
not a surprise

640
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,640
but then we switched to netherlands

641
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,760
germany and singapore

642
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,840
but

643
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,360
i'll leave it at

644
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,280
the ipv6 scans we have currently are

645
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,440
small and we would like to make them

646
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,679
like do more if anybody has data they

647
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,120
would like to share it share with us so

648
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,000
we can actually scan the ipv6 space

649
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,400
more we would love to uh we'd love to

650
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,440
have it

651
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,400
and now

652
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,240
peter will tell us what he actually does

653
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,520
with all that data that we actually

654
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,880
collect

655
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,960
yeah thank you so yeah the lesson here i

656
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
guess from the ipv6 is if you think you

657
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,799
run ipv6 and nobody will find you

658
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,640
because it's not possible to scan then

659
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,799
i'm sorry they're wrong if we can find

660
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,080
them then the bad actors can also do so

661
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,080
so all the data that we collect from

662
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,919
from all the scans

663
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,240
uh we actually set on another mission to

664
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,840
try to identify

665
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,600
all the devices that are out there

666
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,120
accessible on the internet and by

667
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,679
devices i mean essentially anything that

668
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,559
is not a a desktop server a web server

669
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,559
we don't we don't focus on that we want

670
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,799
to focus on let's say let's call it iot

671
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,120
but a very light wide definition of iot

672
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,200
where we can get firewalls and

673
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,120
and home routers and all that stuff as

674
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,960
well and the idea is basically that

675
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,880
since we are running these 100 scans and

676
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,240
we have a lot of

677
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,480
um patterns that we can collect right

678
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,440
banners

679
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,000
uh strings um

680
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,159
this kind of information we can actually

681
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,919
match all these responses or try to

682
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,760
match all these responses and see if we

683
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,279
can identify

684
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,360
uh the make and model of a device that

685
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,120
is out there on on the internet and we

686
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,360
try to classify them by type what type

687
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,320
of device is it a router or a nas or an

688
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,880
ip camera or or something else right uh

689
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,120
we try to classify by vendor

690
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,840
model version and assign it to a sector

691
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,600
like is it a consumer device or is it an

692
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,000
industrial device or just just an

693
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,200
enterprise one

694
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,520
so we implemented a scan rule engine so

695
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,039
think of kind of like some kind of like

696
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,600
a snort for all responses coming in

697
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,760
and it basically classifies all the

698
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,840
scanned data from from dave here as he

699
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,679
submitted submits it to the shadow

700
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,039
server back-end api and we plan to have

701
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,640
like tens of thousands of these roles

702
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,039
but because we have limited uh

703
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,799
processing power human processing power

704
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,559
which actually needs to we need humans

705
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,320
to code the rules we have currently

706
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,000
around 1 200 only but it does give a

707
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,480
pretty good overview already of what is

708
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,799
out there in in various places so we

709
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,080
classify currently devices from from 173

710
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,080
vendors and that is basically up to 30

711
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,520
million

712
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,400
devices daily and we started sharing out

713
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,559
um this this information daily also with

714
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,960
the community um the idea being that you

715
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,799
know you should know really what the

716
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,880
devices are in your in your

717
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,880
constituency if you're a c-cert so that

718
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,279
you can respond adequately to any

719
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,000
threats or vulnerabilities uh that are

720
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,520
found in these devices so you can have

721
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,520
like immediate access to to to this

722
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,120
knowledge coming from us without having

723
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
to design a whole new scan all of a

724
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,520
sudden for confluence or or fortinet

725
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,720
firewalls or or or whatever right so we

726
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,880
have actually a gui for this graphic

727
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,039
interface where we can actually code um

728
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,520
code the rules and observe their usage

729
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,320
um

730
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,440
over time

731
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,000
um that makes it pretty easy to to add

732
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,559
new data set new rules either by

733
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,120
uploading essentially bulk

734
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,279
rules or just coding them

735
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,159
coding them manually and we typically

736
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,600
focus on various ssl

737
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,480
certificate attributes um the common

738
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,480
names their organization names there as

739
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,760
well we can we scan http so we can just

740
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,320
look at html body content and search for

741
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,080
search for patterns http server names

742
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,320
cookies snmp sys desk system uh fields

743
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,360
are very good ftp telnet ssh banners are

744
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,279
also are also good at help and

745
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,279
classifying devices and actually many

746
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,799
many more and there's more going to be

747
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,520
coming in as we try to enrich our scans

748
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,520
uh to collect more of the information

749
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,960
that we need such as like following

750
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,360
redirects where you can actually

751
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,120
follow an initial redirect and and

752
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,120
obtain more information

753
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,360
that is relevant uh to to a particular

754
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,039
device where essentially a login screen

755
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,240
quite often there's a redirect to a

756
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,919
login screen for instance so we're

757
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,440
currently missing that but but

758
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,600
essentially well we plan to add it and

759
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,120
i'll enrich our

760
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,240
our our data um as well so the rules are

761
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,679
really really simple it's just a

762
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,840
question it's just a boolean expression

763
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,240
uh where we try to specify various

764
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,120
fields

765
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,400
and then um and then make a statement uh

766
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,480
uh we just maybe basically assign values

767
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,200
to various fields based uh based on this

768
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,679
um boolean boolean expression so for

769
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,480
example uh if we want to identify

770
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,200
irobot roomba vacuum cleaners and there

771
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,760
are actually 400 of these worldwide um

772
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,640
exposed on the internet imagine that

773
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,000
we can actually look at the issuer

774
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,159
common name which starts with

775
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,159
the roomba string issue organization

776
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,240
name is irobot right and we assigned

777
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,679
that this is an iot

778
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,919
tag a device type is a home appliance we

779
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,520
that's the level of granularity that we

780
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,360
do but it's a vacuum cleaner right

781
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,760
device vendor irobot device model roomba

782
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,520
device sector consumer and we build

783
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,720
rules like this sometimes you need

784
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,200
multiple rules for certain devices

785
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,760
um sometimes you just need one rule uh

786
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,440
to catch to catch everything that's

787
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,360
exposed so

788
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,720
essentially it's a kind of like a

789
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,640
never-ending task where you just add

790
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,880
pile on the rules as new devices appear

791
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,840
or new scans up here which give us

792
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,679
new insight so if you're interested in

793
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,919
roomba vacuum cleaners around 400 out

794
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,159
there

795
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,600
around around the world there used to be

796
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,679
700 a year back so it's dropped a bit so

797
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,120
something must have must have changed

798
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,640
but we didn't really look into that in a

799
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,960
lot of detail philips philips huey

800
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,559
devices you know the smart lightning

801
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,679
systems

802
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,840
on on the internet there's actually 5

803
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,640
300 of those smart lightning systems

804
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,559
stuff people use in their homes

805
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,520
um uh exposed on on the internet thanks

806
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,039
to to well that's what we learned from

807
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,399
our scans most

808
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,960
uh most in the us but also quite a bit

809
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,679
in

810
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,480
in in scandinavia um as well i guess

811
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,960
it's dark quite a lot of times so it's

812
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,200
good there um

813
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,120
we also looked at uh many of the

814
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,880
industrial control system devices like

815
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,000
plc's they all they also have classic

816
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,159
internet protocols enabled right so web

817
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,880
servers enabled or snmp enabled this

818
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,880
kind of thing so for instance we're able

819
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,440
to identify 500 devices just based on

820
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,480
their

821
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,320
non-native so this is not based on on

822
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,520
the s7

823
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,520
protocol but simply on on other

824
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,120
protocols that are exposed out there we

825
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,720
actually also started industrial control

826
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,080
system scanning

827
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,080
that enables us to identify many more of

828
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,840
these types of devices but this is just

829
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,880
a stat for for the classic um

830
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,279
hdp or snmp essentially internet

831
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,279
protocols but s7 300 um 500 devices um

832
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,480
exposed

833
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,960
uh outside mostly germany

834
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,760
um united states and and japan as as you

835
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,880
can see here um microtic is is a device

836
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,880
that is the favorite of of uh

837
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,200
of many of us as as many of them are are

838
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,399
typically

839
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,279
um uh are there their favorite targets

840
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,600
of of many of many actors that use them

841
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,440
then for subsequent attacks whether it's

842
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,080
like ddos or or for tunneling to hide

843
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,399
hide their activities behind behind

844
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,799
various proxies so we are currently

845
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,880
introducing more and more scans so also

846
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,799
microtic dedicated scans

847
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,440
and we find every day

848
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,279
over three million uh essentially

849
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,960
exposed micronic devices um with uh most

850
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,279
of these many of these actually being

851
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,360
in in places like brazil

852
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,600
um especially but well also the united

853
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,799
states countries in europe um and and

854
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,440
and asia so that kind of gives us also

855
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,320
an insight into we started also looking

856
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,520
at at um at honeypot data and trying to

857
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,039
match what devices are actually

858
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,559
attacking the honeypot as well so that

859
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,600
we can get a quick overview of of of the

860
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,559
hacking activity going on at ever at

861
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,760
um various points um in in time 14 at

862
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,440
firewalls for instance uh fortinet is

863
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,200
is the most prominent firewall that we

864
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,960
actually detect in in our scans there

865
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,120
are 1.4 million devices

866
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,640
um so basically you know if if you know

867
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,159
where these devices are when there's a

868
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,320
vulnerability in a firewall or vpn

869
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,919
service which is usually pretty critical

870
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,200
of course uh we provide you the data for

871
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,960
your constituency

872
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,720
that basically provides you like pretty

873
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,760
good situational awareness of um

874
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,960
who is uh who is in danger where and uh

875
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,559
well the interesting thing about all of

876
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,320
this is

877
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,679
that you know we can change our way of

878
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,679
thinking about not just the internet as

879
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,279
in open ports or services but

880
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,600
essentially as in devices right and

881
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,600
different countries different networks

882
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,200
have different profiles and devices

883
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,679
based on whoever um they ended up

884
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,440
purchasing from so

885
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,279
uh think of a country's cyber security

886
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,440
as being determined essentially by the

887
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,760
effectiveness of a sales office of a

888
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,960
vendor in a given country and also to

889
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,799
look at some of the vendors like and see

890
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,039
if the amount of devices that they

891
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,760
they've that we can see um actually

892
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,279
correlates even with the location of

893
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,039
sales offices so we had like a u.s

894
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,240
county

895
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,240
breakdown of certain vendors and you can

896
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,519
find that quite often the amount of

897
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,760
devices that are present

898
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,640
in the counties are there's an office of

899
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,799
a vendor there so so this is how you

900
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,320
know the cyber security posture of a

901
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,240
country or your network is can actually

902
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,120
be

903
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,120
um be decided which is which is which is

904
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,559
interesting

905
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,640
in itself so most of the devices we

906
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,279
currently identify by country uh most

907
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,320
are in in in the united states um not

908
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,240
surprisingly canada interestingly brazil

909
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,760
there's a lot of stuff exposed in canada

910
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,480
but probably shouldn't be exposed

911
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,799
um the top vendor we detect is cisco

912
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,320
then huawei microtic is is third then we

913
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,640
have saturn com modems um

914
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,760
fortinet firewalls asus routers

915
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,760
um et cetera et cetera so there'll be

916
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,519
more and more stuff added here over over

917
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,480
time

918
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,919
um the stuff we are doing here is

919
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,760
actually an eu project and if you want

920
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,519
to see more results from from this

921
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,679
project from us and from other other

922
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,720
partners you can visit various.eu

923
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,360
to get more data and

924
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,559
including

925
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,640
data sets that you could actually use uh

926
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,600
for for for for for other work um like

927
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,679
the statistics that i'm presenting

928
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,200
i'm presenting here

929
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,919
um a lot of our work is going to be also

930
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,519
made public it's not just shared

931
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,679
operationally with uh but we're actually

932
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,919
going to release a new dashboard

933
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,000
um which which you can visit you can get

934
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,240
a preview here it's with a password now

935
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,960
but it will be public um shortly so feel

936
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,200
free to take a photo uh

937
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,279
password username alliance

938
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,880
the username is alliance the password is

939
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,960
safe for internet with a capital s and a

940
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,559
capital i

941
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,000
um

942
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,960
the it does contain uh information about

943
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,880
a lot of our other uh data sets uh it's

944
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,320
this is just the first iteration we'll

945
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,399
have some more stuff there uh we don't

946
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,000
have the device information there yet

947
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,720
but we do have the scans including ipv6

948
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,120
scans so you can get basically a live

949
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,519
view of your country and even a region

950
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,640
um within within a country it's not down

951
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,000
to the as level because we don't really

952
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,240
want to make that public but

953
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,320
but you can at least get to the regional

954
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,600
um regional level

955
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,440
finally if you would like to receive

956
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,120
this data for your constituency

957
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,279
everything that we talked about here

958
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,919
you can do that by visiting our website

959
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,240
um going to subscribe to reports in the

960
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,799
top right corner it's free really free

961
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,080
you just have to provide some basic

962
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,399
information about your network

963
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,000
contact us through your

964
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
through your domain uh work domain

965
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
basically um

966
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,159
and and provide us some information that

967
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,639
we can use to verify um whether you

968
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,040
really are the owner of

969
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,199
of of the network that that you say you

970
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,960
are so really easy

971
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,960
uh to to check out

972
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,199
and that's it um we have a lot of slides

973
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,599
as usual uh as an any single server

974
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,960
presentation but i hope it was a pretty

975
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,320
good overview

976
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,760
of of the scanning ipv4 ipv6 and

977
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,199
and the device fingerprinting that we

978
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,230
have introduced so thank you very much

979
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:44,929
[Applause]

980
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,599
hello sir carter from edison

981
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,639
so asking related to

982
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,359
the

983
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,280
i would say the equipment database that

984
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,800
you have collected

985
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,720
this means that you have now a

986
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,960
capability to

987
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,200
[Music]

988
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,720
flash scan

989
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,599
the network the in the whole internet

990
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,560
for example if you find a new

991
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,240
exchange vulnerability

992
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,480
and you want to identify

993
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,040
which versions are out there so you can

994
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,119
do that basically in within

995
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,359
half an hour

996
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,720
maybe

997
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,640
well we could considering that you have

998
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,920
the all the data i mean you don't have

999
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,160
to scan the whole net you just need to

1000
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,240
bring on all the ip addresses you know

1001
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,960
where there has been exchange server or

1002
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,560
yeah so so at a given point in time

1003
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,800
every day we do know where all the

1004
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,720
certain servers are right like exchange

1005
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,359
or or or others right so that makes it

1006
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,000
easier to scan obviously with a hit list

1007
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,520
uh the scanning is not necessarily

1008
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,680
perfect because it's not dedicated just

1009
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,640
to being uh an exchange and in this case

1010
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,839
in your example we actually do have an

1011
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,000
exchange scan but let's say a fortinet

1012
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,440
scan which i used used before we don't

1013
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,040
have a dedicated fortnite scan right so

1014
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,960
we know there are fortinets there but we

1015
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,400
don't necessarily know the version right

1016
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,839
because they are not dedicated so we

1017
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,480
will need to do a subsequent scan to

1018
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,880
more more a deeper scan to try to

1019
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,400
identify the version that is that is

1020
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,040
true however dave can scan the internet

1021
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,200
very very quickly so

1022
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,640
i would say

1023
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,119
if needed we probably could spin up a

1024
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,040
scan if we since we know the population

1025
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,280
if if we know what the um

1026
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,800
if we know what page we're looking for

1027
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,320
to scrape the information probably could

1028
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,320
do it probably

1029
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,800
uh probably an hour to uh with a little

1030
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,240
bit of dev time but it wouldn't be

1031
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,720
wouldn't be too terribly bad to do

1032
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,320
with the death time right yeah it'd take

1033
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,079
a little bit of dev time but it's not

1034
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,320
it's probably not terrible so so do you

1035
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,359
touch your

1036
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,400
normal dedicated scans you anyway anyway

1037
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,440
record the version numbers

1038
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,359
if it's available if it's available yes

1039
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,680
we do

1040
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,119
carlos from the portuguese academic

1041
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,960
season

1042
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,160
well first thank you for the

1043
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,040
presentation the data you send daily on

1044
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,480
a daily basis and i got a bit concerned

1045
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,720
about the slides where you have shown

1046
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,760
that

1047
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,880
you have said

1048
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,680
no

1049
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,240
laws of u.s are being broken

1050
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,400
so

1051
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,000
you are not saying

1052
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,359
no laws of u.s and eu are being broken

1053
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,359
so should we

1054
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,680
worry about this

1055
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,800
um

1056
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,720
we just say we say no laws in the u.s

1057
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,079
being broken because that is where we s

1058
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,200
that's where the scanning cluster is

1059
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,839
hosted uh we take great pains to not

1060
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,400
break any law when possible um i

1061
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,599
shouldn't even say what possible i just

1062
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,920
don't want to break the law there's

1063
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,440
there's there's no point in doing that

1064
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,040
if we are breaking the law then that

1065
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,960
this scan is not worth running yeah so

1066
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,320
just to be clear none of the scans

1067
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,160
involve exploitation of any kind right

1068
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,079
so they are mostly hello scans or if we

1069
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,240
can find a way to grab a version without

1070
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,400
actually or determining if something is

1071
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,079
vulnerable without actually exploiting

1072
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,839
it that's what we do there are certain

1073
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,160
scans which we could do but we never do

1074
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,400
because they would actually

1075
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,800
involve like reading a bit of memory uh

1076
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,920
from a device for example or essentially

1077
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,200
breaching

1078
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,640
essentially

1079
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,400
exploiting a vulnerability right so this

1080
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,800
is this is what we never do right um as

1081
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,880
dave said we scan from the us so we are

1082
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,520
focused on on not breaking us laws but

1083
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,800
to our knowledge we are also not

1084
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,280
breaking any any other european laws

1085
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,880
either and we certainly wouldn't want to

1086
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,280
break any um that that is that is for

1087
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,560
sure right so we have never had a

1088
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,000
problem with it actually the other

1089
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,880
detail i i was boring also is it seems

1090
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,960
that you are doing the scans only from

1091
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,280
one location with two

1092
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,560
10 gig

1093
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,599
links

1094
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,960
so if it's kind of easy

1095
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,359
to attack this location because it's

1096
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,920
just one location so you uh do you have

1097
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,000
any plans to

1098
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,760
in some way

1099
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,400
have diverse locations so the

1100
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,320
the resilience

1101
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,000
goes

1102
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,240
improves it would be interesting to do

1103
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,520
um

1104
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,560
but

1105
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,160
i mean it's definitely possible to do

1106
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,320
but the problem is that uh it requires

1107
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,119
money and a lot of it because the uh the

1108
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,200
the scanning cluster requires a lot of

1109
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,359
uh a lot of metal to actually run

1110
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:10,960
yeah so i mean if somebody would like to

1111
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,800
fund it then definitely

1112
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,200
that's that's that's a fantastic option

1113
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,440
um we do experience ddos attacks but

1114
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,520
it's never really

1115
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,480
been that it's hampered our operations

1116
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,480
uh we do have other types of attacks

1117
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,839
like uh

1118
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,560
udp poisoning where for the udp scans

1119
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,960
that we reach out that we send out uh

1120
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
someone spoofs responses

1121
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,560
and then we end up reporting false

1122
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,480
positives so that's something that does

1123
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,240
happen but that will happen regardless

1124
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,640
of location right so yeah

1125
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,799
that's

1126
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,359
i think

1127
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,760
but i'm just curious uh have you

1128
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,800
considered using asics to offload the

1129
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,160
cpus for either ipv6 scanning something

1130
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,040
else maybe an asic online network or

1131
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,720
something

1132
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,599
no

1133
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,000
we haven't to be honest

1134
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,440
we've just done everything basically

1135
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,240
just on metal and it's worked so far but

1136
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,000
it probably would be not be a bad idea

1137
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,839
to look down that route

1138
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:16,720
well

1139
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,400
if you've done if you've been doing this

1140
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,560
for eight years then you could have

1141
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,040
probably gotten a bit of value out of

1142
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,280
other board asics or programmable basics

1143
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,440
yeah

1144
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,640
thanks yeah thank you

1145
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,119
okay

1146
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,880
let us thank the speakers again

1147
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,079
you thank you and

1148
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,119
please remember uh view the survey in

1149
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,960
your mobile app

1150
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,400
and uh

1151
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,490
that's it for today thank you

1152
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:54,899
[Applause]
