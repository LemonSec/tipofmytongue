1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,720
well

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,000
we uh

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,599
start to reach the end of today

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,360
the week has flown by so quickly i can't

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,720
believe it's thursday sorry tuesday uh

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,240
the few of the proud those of you who

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,400
have hung on to the end we have saved

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,400
perhaps the best for last

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,680
hank chen

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,720
is going to uh introduce himself because

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,400
he's going to probably do a better job

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,359
than i

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,199
as you can tell if you've been in any of

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,960
the sessions that i've been sharing but

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,880
it is my great privilege to introduce

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,040
you and i'm hoping to learn something

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,200
about uh kicking ransomware out of

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,200
critical infrastructure because gosh it

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
sure does not belong there yeah can i

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,520
have one round of applause

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,640
take it away hank okay thank you

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,120
and good afternoon everyone i'm hank

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,239
from tx1 network and i'm here today to

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,199
talk about our mitigation strategy for

25
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,840
ransomware in critical infrastructure

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,640
and

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,600
why is this important because there are

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,080
more and more ransomware targeting ics

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,600
ot environment

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,720
and our goal is try to defend against

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,119
this ransomware attack

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,280
before i start my presentation let me

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,920
tell you a little bit about my colleague

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,840
and i

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,920
and mars is the closer of this

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,119
presentation

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,560
and he is also is my manager and his

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,159
work many focus on icd scandal iot model

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,439
analysis and enterprise security as for

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,640
me i'm a swear researcher of tx1 network

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,920
and my work many focus on mobile

42
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,240
analysis product security and

43
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,960
vulnerability research and i also is a

44
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,479
ctf player okay

45
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,840
and

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,119
so

47
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,680
now let me go through the outline of

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,600
today's presentation

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,719
and

50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,960
in the first part i will review the

51
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,040
ransomware attack in ics ot environment

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,119
in the last year and

53
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,479
we also

54
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,878
have a five key observation from this

55
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,000
attack

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,280
um

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,920
and we also have a definition of ics

58
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,959
reality ransomware which which help us

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,440
to focus on

60
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,879
and we're attacking

61
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,000
ice uh in critical infrastructure

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,400
and in the next part i will show you our

63
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,319
matrix which is based on a

64
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,319
characteristic of these ransomware

65
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,920
attacking

66
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,160
critical infrastructure and also have

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,319
some case studies about their execution

68
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,280
flow

69
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,280
and in the third part i will show you

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,360
our mitigation strategy for run

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,760
somewhere in the ics-ot environment

72
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,200
because there has there are some

73
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,120
difference between

74
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,959
it and ot

75
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,519
and i will give a demonstration on how

76
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,879
this ransomware mechanism

77
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,760
mitigation mechanism work

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,239
at the end of my presentation i will

79
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,480
talk about the concept of

80
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,200
little trust in ot because our

81
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,080
mitigation strategy is a part of

82
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,720
zero charge in ot and we focus on the

83
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,599
endpoint part

84
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,040
so

85
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,200
let me start with the ics thread in

86
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,599
review

87
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,920
and i would like to take you through the

88
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,360
overview of the

89
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,239
attack on ics ot environment in the last

90
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,680
year

91
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,840
and we can

92
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,280
see there are many

93
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,799
ics related attack and some of them or

94
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,879
most of them are ransomware in the last

95
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,159
year as you can see in the first half of

96
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,680
2021

97
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,920
a large number of companies were

98
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,120
attacked by a rebel such as acer and

99
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,159
kasia

100
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,159
and especially acer

101
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,560
which is a taiwan company and serve a

102
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,879
loss of 15 u.s million dollar

103
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,920
in the second half of 2021 we saw a lot

104
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,519
of attack on the company by lock b 2.0

105
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,040
and such as bangkok air or erg

106
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,519
and i will talk about more detail about

107
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,360
this to ransomware later

108
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,639
so after

109
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,959
reviewing the isis trade in the

110
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,918
last year we conclude five key

111
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,960
observations regarding this isis threat

112
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,720
in 2021

113
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,639
and the first one is based on our

114
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,840
statistic

115
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,800
the most active criminal group are in

116
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,320
2021 are

117
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,600
county maze lockbeat rebel and dark side

118
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,840
and the second one is they target the

119
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,360
critical infrastructure and leverage

120
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,639
supply chain attack for example colonial

121
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,240
pipeline attack

122
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
by the dark side and the concealed

123
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,919
supply chain attacked by the reveal

124
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,240
and the third one is the hacker adopt

125
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,759
ras

126
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,840
which means long as the business model

127
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,919
service

128
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,800
with the affiliate program

129
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,199
and the fourth one is the u.s president

130
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,600
also signed an executive order to

131
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,240
improve the national security

132
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,039
and

133
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:15,919
which

134
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,440
benefit the

135
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,840
critical infrastructure

136
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,560
and the fifth one is just like the past

137
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,840
in 2021 there are more vulnerability and

138
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,720
hacker leveraging variability more

139
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,240
ability such as cassia vsa and look for

140
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,560
j

141
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,320
and from the previous slide we saw many

142
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,840
ransomware attack and some key

143
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,479
observation

144
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,479
because an

145
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,800
old environment ot environment is

146
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,880
vulnerable and the impact could be

147
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,520
disastrous so i would like to introduce

148
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,039
our definition

149
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,840
of ics relative ransomware and it can be

150
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,919
categorized as two type

151
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,440
and

152
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,800
if on

153
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,120
and our mitigation strategy will focus

154
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,039
on these two

155
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,759
type of ics relative ransomware

156
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,919
as you can see on the left

157
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,280
um

158
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,400
this category is the ics relationship

159
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,759
we're targeting the ics specification

160
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,039
application and certificate and the

161
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,120
renzo in this category might have some

162
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,360
ics qualities

163
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,240
or

164
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,479
it helps

165
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,000
affect the ics application directory

166
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,639
like use some ics protocol

167
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,880
and the other category

168
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,880
are affect the

169
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,520
industry in the ot

170
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,440
such as medical

171
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,440
traffic water and so on

172
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,400
so after reviewing this ics thread in

173
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,440
the past we know there are many

174
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,400
uh now many ransomware attack targeting

175
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,960
ics ot environment so let's move on the

176
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,400
characteristic

177
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,720
of ransomware that

178
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,120
affect critical infrastructure in this

179
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,840
part i will show you what the behavior

180
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,720
of ics-related ransomware

181
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,520
and how this ransomware work

182
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,759
so you understand why

183
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,560
our mitigation strategy design and

184
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,599
and why

185
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,319
our misintegration strategy work for

186
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,759
preventing this ransomware

187
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,560
so i would like to show you the ics

188
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,680
relative

189
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,599
ransomware matrix

190
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,960
it consists of 16 on different ics

191
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,240
ransomware

192
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,520
and

193
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,720
you can see in the in the this slide

194
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,479
they're just a

195
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,879
first half of the 16th ransomware and

196
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,199
the next half of 16 ransomware well in

197
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,639
the next slide

198
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,960
so the purpose of this matrix is to

199
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,639
analyze the ics relative ransomware

200
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,560
behavior and prevent their attack and we

201
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,440
can successfully successfully defend

202
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,599
against these 16 ransomware by knowing

203
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,840
their behavior so

204
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,080
let's take a look at the matrix

205
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,400
in general ransomware would have most of

206
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,479
behaviors show in the matrix so you

207
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,759
might wonder

208
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,440
why some some

209
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,800
entry is known

210
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,680
and because we only analyze the man pe

211
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,840
file of the ransomware because we want

212
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,840
to protect the endpoint product

213
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,720
so you will see that only a few behavior

214
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,199
will appear

215
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,440
and after further analysis it shows

216
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,000
there are two trends we notice the main

217
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,919
pe file

218
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,399
of the ransomware framework

219
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,799
are more customized and completeness in

220
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,399
a single pe file

221
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,000
for customization

222
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,160
the hacker design ransomware based on

223
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,399
existing configuration and a command

224
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,760
argument such as reveal and for

225
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,160
the hacker decide the ransomware to use

226
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,959
a faster file encryption algorithm

227
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,680
complicate complicated key management

228
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,320
and the domain natural moving such as

229
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,440
dark bit 2.0

230
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,560
and

231
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,000
to

232
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,080
to increase the visibility of ransomware

233
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,480
so that we can better detect them

234
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,320
understanding more detail about

235
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,360
ransomware execution flow will help us a

236
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,519
lot when we try to design the mitigation

237
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,880
strategy

238
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,959
so we pick out some execution flow of

239
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,360
ransomware to let you know

240
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,120
how rinsing will work

241
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,959
and i would like to show you here is the

242
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,640
lock b 2.0 and which is the

243
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,720
most frequent attack in the first

244
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,200
quarter of 2022

245
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,720
and based on our statistic

246
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,880
and we break them down into a step

247
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,600
and in our research we look at each step

248
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,839
and try to figure out the best practice

249
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,760
our mitigation strategy will focus on

250
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,480
some of common behavior of these 16

251
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,600
ransomware such as creating new text

252
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,519
current process and service and

253
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,560
emulating files with this shadow copy

254
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,959
and so on

255
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,200
so let's take a closer look at the

256
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,000
lateral movement of luck b 2.0

257
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,040
the luck bit 2.0 adopt the ad domain

258
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,279
group policy and run an old domain

259
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,200
machine by powershell

260
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,079
although our material strategy is not

261
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,600
currently focused on these techniques

262
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,360
we still have

263
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,680
to keep this in my mind because we'll

264
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,959
talk about it later

265
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,600
and i'd like to tell you more about the

266
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,000
common characteristic this ransomware

267
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,120
would have

268
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,839
for example wannacry which is the most

269
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,160
notorious ransomware in the world and

270
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,000
the most interesting thing about archive

271
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,320
is that it contains multiple files in a

272
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,839
single p file

273
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,920
and these files are for different

274
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,640
functionality again our mitigation

275
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,279
strategy can focus on some of these

276
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,680
common behavior even they are in the

277
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,079
different files

278
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,519
and another notorious reason why is

279
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,040
reveal

280
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,680
in the casino vsa attack

281
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,680
reveal side loading itself as a windows

282
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,480
defender to trick the system

283
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,720
and it has a three layer paper

284
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,720
and configuration encrypted by rc4

285
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,959
this means it is a ransomware which can

286
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,920
be

287
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,079
customized by the attacker

288
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,800
and there are common behavior we just

289
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
saw in the previous slide

290
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,040
so our mitigation strategy can focus on

291
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,279
them

292
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,000
so let's move on to

293
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,160
another resin wheel which is regular

294
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,720
locker the most interesting thing about

295
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,120
ringlocker is that it drop the windows

296
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,000
xpvn and mount the target file system

297
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,399
and then run itself inside the vm to

298
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,160
avoid detection

299
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,480
however we can detect file operation on

300
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,720
the target file system when it starts

301
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,839
encryption

302
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,560
in this case the detection of behavior

303
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,000
might be difficult

304
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,959
so our

305
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,040
mechanism has multiple phase

306
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,320
in case we fail to catch it in the

307
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,040
earlier phase

308
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,760
so after understanding how ransomware

309
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,560
work

310
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,720
and their behavior we conclude the

311
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,519
common attack path of ics reality

312
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,399
ransomware based on miter evaluation

313
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,279
there are seven phase in the ics-related

314
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,680
ransomware attack

315
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,079
and the first one russian attack might

316
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,920
access the

317
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,639
victim system in memory many different

318
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,680
ways such as vision email or downloading

319
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,959
or

320
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,440
vulnerability

321
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,360
and then it will be executed by the

322
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,560
powershell or windows command line

323
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,760
and it will try to discover more service

324
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,240
open in the system

325
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,600
and it also hides itself

326
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,480
or

327
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,279
shut down the antivirus or firewall

328
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,440
and

329
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,079
it will try to infect as many possible

330
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,880
endpoints in the system

331
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,600
and it might still secret data or some

332
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,680
secret information and send it back to

333
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,560
the c2 server

334
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,000
finally

335
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,920
it was down ransomware and this phase is

336
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
what we focus on

337
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,800
and

338
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,319
we will start ransomware here

339
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,800
so according to our matrix

340
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,279
in the previous slide we also sum up

341
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,920
some techniques used in the ics relative

342
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,880
ransomware in terms of defense

343
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,760
some of these behavior are important in

344
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,920
preventing the ransomware attack

345
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,199
the atomic check by the mutex or file

346
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,240
marker

347
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,480
kill the process service which used the

348
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,320
file to be encrypt

349
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,360
nt recovery by deleting shadow copy and

350
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,880
partial encryption and so on

351
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,519
so after fully understanding the

352
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,720
behavior of this ics related ransomware

353
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,680
and their

354
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,920
execution flow now i'm going to talk

355
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,439
about our mitigation strategy

356
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,240
so and before mitigating ransomware with

357
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,920
based on

358
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,800
minor evaluation matrix for ics will

359
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,880
apply some tactics of showing the red

360
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,800
and corresponding techniques showing the

361
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,000
purple to determine the best mitigation

362
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,199
solution

363
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,680
so just to let you know

364
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,480
some techniques which are common when

365
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,120
evaluating ransomware in ics-ot

366
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,000
environment for example data movement

367
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,560
involves remote service technique and it

368
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,959
can help us to determine whether the

369
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,120
ransomware can spread or not

370
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,279
just like lock b 2.0

371
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,920
use domain group policy to spread itself

372
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,639
and through the miter evaluation we gain

373
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,720
a good understanding of the ransomware

374
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,600
attack attacking the ics-ot environment

375
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,839
we can mitigate ransomware by tackling

376
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,800
24 mitigation to protect the icsot

377
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,920
environment

378
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,120
this 24 mitigation can be grouped under

379
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,120
three categories and

380
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,959
there are 12 for the

381
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,279
human policy and

382
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,360
nine for the end point and five for the

383
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,800
network

384
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,199
as we know usually there is no virus

385
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,199
patent update no

386
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,040
network segmentation and no update

387
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,240
system in ics ot environment

388
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,320
however we can adopt this mitigation

389
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,279
technique to enhance our security

390
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,199
for example network segmentation can

391
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,480
help

392
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,880
to isolate the vulnerable network from

393
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,600
public and naval intrusion prevention

394
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,759
can provide the virtual patch for

395
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,360
vulnerable system

396
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,360
and exploit protection

397
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,000
prevent the exploit on the end of

398
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,120
service

399
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,600
software

400
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,199
and usually we can mitigate ransomware

401
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,680
effectively by applying all the

402
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,839
techniques i've just mentioned earlier

403
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,000
however a lot of people don't know if

404
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,399
ransomware attack ics ot environment

405
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,040
mitigation will be much more challenging

406
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,279
there are three reasons

407
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,920
and the first one is compared with it

408
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,800
environment it is hard to update the

409
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,040
latest viral pattern in the ics old

410
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,120
environment because they can stop their

411
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,160
operation and they can take risk to

412
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,560
update the system because it might cause

413
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,240
the system reboot

414
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,160
so the ransomware with new design can

415
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
bypass this pattern

416
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,040
and the second one is the variety of

417
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,600
operating environment of ot is low which

418
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,680
makes it more vulnerable for the same

419
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,560
attack from the ransomware group

420
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,120
and the third one is it is hard to

421
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,360
minimize the impact

422
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,079
because if ransomware caused

423
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,519
operation shutdown in ot it might cause

424
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,079
more critical impacts such as

425
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,399
back out watercolors or even nuclear

426
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,440
accident

427
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,360
for this reason it will be harder to

428
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,480
implement the mitigation and we have to

429
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,439
be careful to implement this strategy in

430
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,559
ics old environment

431
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,959
and despite the challenge we have a

432
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,439
solution to mitigate a ransomware attack

433
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,839
on ics-ot environment based on our

434
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,559
analysis of this ransomware attack

435
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,720
we can overcome the limitation mentioned

436
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,280
in the previous slide we proposed the

437
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,760
practical ransomware mitigation strategy

438
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,400
in the ics world our strategy involves

439
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,240
three phase

440
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,559
and we combine those three phase

441
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,240
and try to complement each shortage

442
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,080
and the first one is non-ransomware

443
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,640
scanning which is based on

444
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,280
malware pattern however the method might

445
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,640
not work because the pattern is old

446
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,960
and the second one is ics related

447
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,240
ransomware pre-detection mechanism

448
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,039
which can improve our ability to detect

449
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,600
ransomware before they stop encryption

450
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,000
however and they still have some false

451
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,480
positive like

452
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,559
run someone might disguise as a normal

453
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,960
ransomware a normal software and a

454
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,520
normal software might be mistaken as a

455
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,360
ransomware

456
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,600
and so we have a third

457
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,400
phase

458
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,480
which is ransomware encryption sequence

459
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,840
detection

460
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,000
and we can prevent the file encryption

461
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,720
on the ics machine this phase is

462
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,280
effective in stopping ransomware but

463
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,480
might slow down the system performance

464
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,760
so after introducing our mitigation

465
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,480
strategy i will introduce each phase in

466
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,440
the following slides and the first phase

467
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,799
is about

468
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,679
most

469
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,000
malware patents and this is common and

470
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,559
well-known method so i will skip this

471
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,760
space here

472
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,520
so and let me tell you more about the

473
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,120
second phase

474
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,280
which is ics related ransomware

475
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,320
pre-detection mechanism

476
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,400
usually a ransomware would have

477
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,440
four most frequent behavior

478
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,000
according to our analyze

479
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,919
we

480
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,280
and they should be detected at this

481
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,840
stage they are process termination file

482
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,320
enumeration mutex creation and shadow

483
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,760
copy deletion

484
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,919
however our demo do not block all of

485
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,880
this behavior because we want to

486
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,080
capture all

487
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,039
in the video

488
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,160
if we

489
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,080
collect more information to verify

490
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,520
ransomware attack

491
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,280
we can stop one of

492
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,679
the malicious behavior to reduce the

493
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,320
impact or even stop reversing where

494
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,799
before they start encryption will spread

495
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,120
so i would like to start show you our

496
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,760
demo of this ransomware predetection

497
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,400
mechanism

498
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,200
in this video you will see uh

499
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,320
the detection of log b 2.0 and

500
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,280
we can identify the suspicious behavior

501
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,679
by analyzing

502
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,320
the process triggered by this behavior

503
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,880
we detect these four behavior by the

504
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,400
kernel driver which is harder to bypass

505
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,120
compare with the user more hooking so

506
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,880
let me start our

507
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,360
demo video

508
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,679
so you can see our driver is recording

509
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,440
malware behavior to detect any

510
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,080
suspicious and log base 2.0 is create

511
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,360
and maybe oh here is create new text it

512
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,000
has been detected

513
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,080
and

514
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,879
after a while

515
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,600
you can see here is a process export and

516
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,480
it will be terminate here and the

517
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,960
terminator process will speed detect

518
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,200
and then is the inner file will speed

519
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,600
detect

520
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,919
and then we capture the child process

521
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,440
created by the log b 2.0

522
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,400
and

523
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
here is the vsa domain created by the

524
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
child process and which is used for

525
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,799
deleted shadow copy and the initial copy

526
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,080
is being

527
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,480
be detected

528
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,320
so at in the end you can see the

529
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,200
wallpaper is changed and rugby 2.0

530
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,240
encrypted entire system

531
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,280
and all of the four behavior i mentioned

532
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,159
earlier was being detected and to be

533
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,360
precise

534
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,840
uh detection you can add more condition

535
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,760
like which process should not be

536
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,000
terminated or which

537
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,080
certain things of shadow copies should

538
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,799
not be deleted

539
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,520
so after having introducing the

540
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,360
pre-detection mechanism

541
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,440
i would like to talk about the last

542
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,960
phase of our

543
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,760
mitigation strategy ransomware encrypts

544
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,159
sequence detection which is the last

545
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,520
defense for defeating ransomware attack

546
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,240
and it is also more precise and

547
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,440
effective

548
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,880
to let you know

549
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,280
how we can detect ransomware in crypt

550
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,760
sequence i will demonstrate how rugby

551
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,480
2.0 does file encryption

552
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,640
we know log b 2.0 adopt the

553
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,200
multi-threading encryption strategy

554
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,760
which means besides the menstruate

555
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,159
there are two types of thread will be

556
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,039
spawn

557
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,120
they are innumerable file thread and

558
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,158
encrypt file thread

559
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,640
and all these threads are designed to

560
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,880
communicate with each other and the

561
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,960
menstrual will first initialize our

562
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,679
completion port which is used for

563
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,000
multi-thread communication

564
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,600
what you see here is a part of

565
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
multi-thread communication of lockbeat

566
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,360
2.0 the mainstream also generates

567
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,520
two thread ports to store enumeration

568
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,520
file thread and encryption file through

569
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,000
and most of ransomware is designed to

570
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,360
create a wireless to avoid system crash

571
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,320
so like we also do these things

572
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,039
so you can see here are the qualities

573
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,720
like being used

574
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,360
and once the immersion files restart it

575
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,679
will check all the files in the system

576
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,039
and it only encrypts the ones is not in

577
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,240
the whitelist

578
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,640
as i mentioned earlier

579
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,799
necessary communication with each other

580
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,760
so

581
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,400
after that the information about which

582
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,640
files have to be equipped will be sent

583
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,559
to the encrypt file stream and here is

584
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,080
the create file

585
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,400
and then it sends the file

586
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,600
by

587
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,520
anti-set information file

588
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,840
so the encryption set the encryption

589
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,640
start after the encryption files receive

590
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,960
this information from the innumerable

591
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,240
file thread

592
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,120
and

593
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,480
when the encryption

594
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,400
is downloaded 2.0

595
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,720
write the encrypt data back to the

596
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,360
target file and rename the file

597
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,760
so to help us decide the mechanism to

598
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,240
defend the system against the ransomware

599
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,440
attack we studied the 16 ics relative

600
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,000
ransomware i showed you before and

601
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,960
analyze all this encryption sequence

602
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,000
it can verify these five

603
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,640
type of file io sequence then we can

604
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,919
confirm

605
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,559
the ransomware is attacking the system

606
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,799
then the mechanism we design can block

607
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,960
it

608
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
and i would like to show you how

609
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,840
block runs

610
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,279
by ransomware in crypt sequence

611
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,080
dictation our design combines the

612
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,400
finding of our analysis and the

613
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,000
reference paper unveil which is a paper

614
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,880
published in unix 2016

615
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,159
and it shows there are three categories

616
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,200
of

617
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,600
file our sequence you can block

618
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,760
and in our mechanism we can block all

619
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,640
file

620
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,360
on our sequence i just

621
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,799
show you the previous slide

622
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,600
so let me sum up our mechanism which can

623
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,080
mitigate three categories of resume

624
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,840
attack they are rinsing with

625
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,640
non-ransomware attack

626
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,919
and variant ransomware attack and the

627
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,760
unknown reservoir attack for

628
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,559
non-resource attack we propose to use

629
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,159
non-resource scanning to defeat

630
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,640
ransomware which is virus patent

631
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,880
and for variant ransomware attack we

632
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,760
propose to use ics relative ransomware

633
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,400
pre-detection mechanism to diff to

634
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,039
detect ransomware

635
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,279
and for unknown resume attack we propose

636
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,520
to use ransomware encrypt sequence

637
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,960
detection to stop ransomware

638
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,080
and

639
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,559
i would like to conclude my presentation

640
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,559
with the goal we will try to accomplish

641
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,760
in our work

642
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,960
it is called otz0 trust which is a

643
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,520
concept to protect mission critical

644
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,720
asset to keep operation running

645
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,559
in ig environment

646
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,720
any logon user could be evil

647
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,440
but in ics-ot environment any critical

648
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,000
asset could be also be evil

649
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,320
this makes the detention more difficult

650
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,120
ics old environment we should verify

651
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,799
network endpoint user asset

652
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,440
or even the supply chain of software

653
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,919
for this reason our mitigation strategy

654
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,120
for ransomware must consist of multiple

655
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,159
phases to increase the accuracy and to

656
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,080
minimize the false

657
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,919
false negative

658
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,559
so in conclusion it is high

659
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,279
to successfully defend against

660
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,000
ransomware attack which you never trust

661
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,960
always verify

662
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,159
and that is the end of my presentation i

663
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,440
just show you

664
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,919
our mitigation strategy for ransomware

665
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,039
in ics-ot environment and it is a part

666
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:41,840
of

667
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,039
ot-0 trust to prevent reservoir in the

668
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,080
endpoint

669
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,000
thank you for your attention and

670
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,200
now i would like to invite any questions

671
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,000
you might have

672
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,960
[Applause]

673
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,039
all right we got mike's out here i know

674
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,520
it's been a long day for some of you but

675
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,799
uh

676
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,480
if you don't ask now i'm afraid you're

677
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,039
gonna have to catch bank later on at the

678
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,480
break

679
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,200
got any questions

680
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
just for now two for one belgian

681
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,919
chocolates for questions

682
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,640
okay okay well um let me ask you this

683
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,399
question

684
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,159
uh you think that

685
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,320
we're going to have solved the ot

686
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,679
problem

687
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,600
10 years from now

688
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,559
um

689
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,559
i think we have to

690
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,760
improve

691
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,880
we have some

692
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,480
progress to solve some 4d problem

693
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,200
for example there's um some

694
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,840
some firm will concern the system

695
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,399
performance and we

696
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,600
do a lot of effort to solve this problem

697
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,640
and

698
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,640
this is a kind of difference between

699
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,760
enterprise

700
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,000
product because they don't care about

701
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,760
the system performance

702
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,080
and the other firmware very clear about

703
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,960
this

704
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,440
so we have progress on this

705
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,760
excellent

706
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,679

709
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,960
according to my calculations we still

710
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,159
have

711
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,799
three more days to be together and to

712
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,440
