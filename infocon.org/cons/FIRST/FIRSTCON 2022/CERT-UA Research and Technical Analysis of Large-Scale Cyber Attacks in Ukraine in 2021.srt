here in dublin

40
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,920
we all read news and uh there was a

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,119
barbarian act of terrorism

42
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,640
with shelling a

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,840
shopping mall

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,439
yesterday

45
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,079
and ukraine unfortunately continues to

46
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,640
be a battlefield for

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,320
conventional war

48
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,640
but not only conventional

49
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
and cyber war as well

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,159
and uh

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,119
we are

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,600
very busy with the combating cyber

53
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,799
threats

54
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,720
we think this

55
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,720
cyber component of hybrid aggression

56
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,160

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,840
half a year

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,720
and

59
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,720
perhaps every case would require a

60
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,760
single presentation

61
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,239
but we will try to fit everything into

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,280
25 minutes and let the space like 10

63

one 1306

150
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,960
incidents and the health of this

151
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,599
incident is a critical or

152
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,080
high level it means that

153
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,240
the attackers

154
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,240

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,120
infrastructures

163
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,000
from the beginning of the year we're now

tracking like 43 actors

165
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,520
the actors presented here are

166
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,960
in number of cyber uh descending order

167
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,880
by number of cyber incident involving by

168
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,280
actor

169
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,840
you can see the armageddon troop at the

170
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,280
top of the list

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,679
and

172
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,199
cobble strike

173
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,080
a little less and

174
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,800
and then and then

175
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,000
the scale of this is a registered

176
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
incident by the critical by the

177
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,080
by the severity

178
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,160
by days of the year

179
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,120
so

180
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,360
at the beginning of the year

181
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,520
this big red

182
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,199
line it's

183
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,879
the 14th

184
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,879
of january

185
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,080
when the large cyber attacks on

186
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,680
a big amount of

187
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,759
government organization was happened

188
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,840
about the sectors

189
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,320
we can see that the most interesting

190
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,839
sector is a government then

191
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,640
uh the uh

192
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,080
the most targeted followed by the

193
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,760
second target is the military

194
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,560
organization who is

195
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,839
ex

196
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,000
increased number of attacks on military

197
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,480
organizations in this year then the

198
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,880
interested in finance sessions finance

199
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,640
sector commercial energy telecom and 80

200
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,600
of course the main types

201
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,959
is fishing

202
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,720
fishing for

203
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,279
account complementation fishing for

204
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,399
melville malware

205
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,040
fish

206
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,839
if malware distribution the dos attacks

207
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,360
the dos attacks are

208
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,480
very popular

209
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,080
again

210
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,440
during the war

211
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,640
and health

212
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,399
just a little compression

213
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,399
at the same period of time

214
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,519
in last year and this year

215
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,279
we can

216
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,120
see much more

217
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,560
incidents that are critical and high

218
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,800
during the same period into 2022 and

219
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,000
incorporation to sunday 2021.

220
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,800
so

221
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,720
as i think

222
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,120
the

223
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,040
russian federation launched a

224
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,200
large-scale cyber war

225
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,040
a month before

226
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,959
the full-scale invasion

227
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:13,920
and

228
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,440
in january 14 i woke up early in the

229
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,800
morning

230
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,440
at 3am am because

231
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,279
my phone began to receive a lot of

232
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,320
message

233
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,519
and

234
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,399
where

235
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,240
when i look at my work messenger

236
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,240
i see this picture and messages that

237
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,920
all government organizations are hacked

238
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,279
so

239
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,240
at 3 a.m i wake up and 4 a.m we

240
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,519
start the meeting with the main actors

241
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,399
of cyber security in ukraine

242
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,760
uh to decide what we need to do

243
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,560
the first what we figure out that all

244
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,959
this organization was a customers of uh

245
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,959
one it service

246
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:03,760
uh

247
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,880
company

248
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,360
that provides them ite services and all

249
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,440
these sites was developed

250
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,760
all these hacked site sites was

251
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,800
developed by this company

252
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,110
so we decided to

253
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,889
[Music]

254
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,839
to include there to our investigation

255
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,000
group includes representatives from

256
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,839
these organizations

257
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,079
the first tip that they gave us was that

258
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,120
site

259
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
was hacked by the

260
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,800
october cms

261
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,399
by the exploit exploiting the

262
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,920
vulnerability in october cms

263
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,040
on which

264
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,399
this website was built

265
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,000
so we

266
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,680
accept this hypothesis and starting to

267
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,480
investigate this incident

268
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,279
but

269
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,079
on the stage when we starting to collect

270
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,200
data

271
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,200
we

272
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
we realized that

273
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,279
the things are more better that only the

274
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,160
face

275
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,279
because some organization tell us that

276
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,760
we can't give you

277
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
copies of the web servers for our

278
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,560
analyze because

279
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,680
it's destroyed it's it's simply deleted

280
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,839
and we need to restore it from backup

281
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,839
of course it's a problem because

282
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,920
many organizations their first

283
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,800
deal in such cyber attacks they need to

284
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,519
restore their infrastructure and then

285
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,560
they

286
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,279
began to work with us to investigate

287
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,639
incident

288
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,360
because top management wants to restore

289
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,560
work

290
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,800
and in some organization we start to

291
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,160
analyze

292
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,200
data

293
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,320
after two or three days after the

294
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,120
incident happens

295
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,920
so

296
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,079
at first point we

297
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,279
we receive

298
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,720
some data from the organizations that

299
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,720
was affected the less

300
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,560
from this 37 organizations it was only

301
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,920
sorry 22 organizations it was only have

302
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,480
a website deface but not

303
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,560
destroyed infrastructure

304
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,480
and start to

305
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,720
analyzing clocks

306
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,320
and yes we see in locks the exploitation

307
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,480
of the

308
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,600
october

309
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,959
cv

310
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,519
october cms cv

311
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,639
but

312
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,839
when we

313
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,160
die a little deeply

314
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
we saw that

315
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,160
the

316
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,360
[Music]

317
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,600
that exploitation uh

318
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
of october cv

319
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,440
october cms cv

320
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,480
was not the reason of the deface

321
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,519
that the actors

322
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,639
deface

323
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,240
size manually

324
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,040
they

325
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,199
connect to the servers through the ssh

326
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,560
create new user

327
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,440
for

328
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,519
with name username

329
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,399
for persistence and delete index index

330
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,000
php file

331
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,800
by hand and we get a file from the

332
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,760
separate server

333
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,959
and on different

334
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,760
organizations different machines it

335
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,120
happens in different time

336
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,639
we send this data to our soc some of the

337
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,120
affected organizations uh was their

338
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,720
clients and we see that

339
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,839
in some organization we get comment was

340
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,199
excluded at

341
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,279
2 24 a.m and some at three or no five so

342
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,279
that was not script they do they it's by

343
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,399
this activity by hand

344
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,720
unfortunately

345
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,199
we can't collect data from this site

346
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,279
because when we start investigation in

347
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:37,160
the morning it was already down

348
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,600
it's about the face

349
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,839
but

350
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,000
on the next day we received uh physical

351
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,040
hard drives of the employees computer of

352
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,120
on one of the big ukrainian government

353
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,320
organization

354

that was destroyed

355
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,360
we recover these disks and

356
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,320
find

357
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,240
a file that's called stage one xz

358
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,839
in the evening

359
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,759
this day microsoft published

360
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,560
a topic

361
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,440
report about the malware targ viper

362
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,720
melville targeting ukraine and call it

363
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,240
whisper which brigade

364
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,240
when we start analyzing

365
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,560
this malware

366
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,199
we call it boot patch

367
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,680
because

368
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,279
after our analysis we

369
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,079
figure out that

370
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,480
this is uh

371
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,120
thanks to god they have a system on this

372
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,880
machine and we

373
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,519
see this impacted command

374
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,480
that

375
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,839
runs this file also we find uh found the

376
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,959
server from which linux server from wish

377
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,559
they runs this in packet commands

378
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,720
and it was the

379
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,880
hackath website

380
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,839
of this organization with the face

381
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,120
and

382
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,919
in some organizations then destroy

383
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,039
networks without wipers

384
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,200
they

385
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,160
connect to the

386
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,440
hypervisors create the users

387
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,679
compromise the admin users it's the

388
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,160
baddest

389
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,640
baddest example

390
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,520
in this organization that was destroyed

391
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,000
all network all virtual network is a

392
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,720
better example of the

393
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,080
network configurations that we see but

394
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,039
because of this as you can see

395
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,640
the destroying of virtual machine

396
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,120
happens at eight o'clock in the morning

397
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,160
so

398
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,559
we already start investigation all know

399
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,960
about this incident

400
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,880
all know that

401
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,679
organization clients of the supply

402
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,120
supply chain

403
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,880
core

404
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,880
the organization

405
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,600
that was attacked first the i.t service

406
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,440
provider

407
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,600
he reported or all their clients about

408
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
the fact of the cyber incident he

409
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,440
reports they reported

410
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,720
like at four o'clock at night

411
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,480
but we see that

412
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,160
they do nothing because of this

413
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,679
they lost

414
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,400
all their infrastructure

415
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,239
something like that

416
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,640
so

417
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,039
after this it was a little bit quiet

418
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,640
after these attacks

419
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,039
uh only we have a big

420
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,919
the dos attacks on the financial sector

421
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,039
in the

422
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,600
uh february 15

423
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,280
where when

424
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,960
because of those banks not working

425
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,400
you can people can you can't use their

426
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,960
mobile banking

427
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,600
but it was a little quiet

428
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,840
but

429
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,880
the day

430
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,320
before the war started

431
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,280
[Music]

432
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,960
with the help of soc we detected

433
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,559
two organizations

434
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,440
where

435
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,679
with in pocket activity

436
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,520
and

437
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,799
we think that

438
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,120
after this impact activity it will be

439
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,520
viper activity

440
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,960
the day before

wire begins with we collect data

442
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,400
uh

443
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,679
turn off some infrastructure for

444

but at

450
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,159
i think

451
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,799
at two o'clock at night

452
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,840
after the

453
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,600
after the speech of the president of

454
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,559
ukraine to the russian

455
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,600
nation

456
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,559
about

457
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,039
that they don't need to start the war

458
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,679
the massive kibber attacks begins and

459
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,760
this organization where we provide

460
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,520
analysis was

461
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,039
wiped

462
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,360
other many organizations was vipered

463
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,360
some of the organizations that viped

464
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,080
at the first cyber attack at 30 or 14

465
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,880
january was wiped again the same deface

466
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,600
at this time

467
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,000
massive the dos attacks provides on the

468
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,919
banks media so people can't open new

469

470
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,000
in three hours after the large doodles

471
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,240
the large cyber attacks begins

472
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,840
begins the invasion of russia

473
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,720
so at this time when

474
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,960
at two o'clock i remember that a few

475
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,960
days even earlier i read the post

476
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,280
that the

477
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,799
usa representative said that the where

478
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,280
the war will begins with large cyber

479
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,559
attacks and at two o'clock in the sense

480
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,799
that

481
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,360
it will be

482
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,520
so

483
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,200
uh

484
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,280
two words about the dos

485
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,600
this is uh what happens when the dos

486
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,360
started uh

487
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,320
at the

489
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,840
this the dos

490
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,320
was covered by emails

491

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,919
government institutions

531
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,520
also we found

532
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,960
the sites

533
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,159
that was

534
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,679
writed

535
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,760
developed with help of wordpress and

536
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,240
the site that was not updated with

537
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,760
without not updated wordpress

538
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,200
was hacked

539
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,640
and

540
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,360
the actors we think that this is the

541
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,720
same actor

542
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,520
that's cyber cyber army of russia bar

543
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,960
hacked this site and tried the

544
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,000
script

545
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,840
where visitors

546
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,520
visit the sites

547
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,840
at the time when they surfing through

548
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,240
the pages

549
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,520
there send a

550
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,559
request to the site in the list

551
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,480
here

552
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,760
and also here not only ukrainian side

553
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,400
but we see some go ua

554
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,039
ukrainian commercial sites and some

555
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,320
other

556
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,039
international sites

557
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,279
the trend of the

558
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,960
2022

559
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,440
in cyber attacks of ukraine is a cyber

560
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,840
attacks with

561
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,480
usage of different vipers

562
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,600
we think

563
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,480
that

564
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,039
all these

565
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,559
campaigns

566
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,520
are provided by one actor

567
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,200
it's sandworm

568
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,320
because

569
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,039
we

570
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,400
investigate

571
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,799
from the beginning the the war we

572
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,400
investigate like

573
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,520
maybe

574
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,679
15 different

575
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,640
incidents in different organization

576
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,880
where

577
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,279
vipre activity was provided

578
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,320
and in all this organization we see the

579
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,679
same tools we see the same

580
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,240
tactics

581
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,840
we see that

582
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,679
in 99

583
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,880
cases

584
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,039
they uses

585
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,440
used

586
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,919
vulnerabilities in public web resources

587
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:06,960
to

588
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,559
initial access

589
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,480
they never use

590
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,279
phishing emails

591
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,679
only

592
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,360
exploitation or of public resources like

593
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,320
exchange server websites vpns

594
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,440
today it goes ago was a funny station

595
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,600
one organization where we

596
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,520
investigate incident

597
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,200
and we

598
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,480
told

599
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,880
tell them that they need to provide too

600
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,120
far for their vpn

601
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,880
and one week ago they decided to

602
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,279
turn off z2fa

603
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,799
on another day when they turned off

604
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,440
the the one of the

605
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,400
users

606
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,279
was

607
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,400
hacked

608
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,279
and

609
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,200
two days after this

610
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,440
after offering to faye the impacted

611
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,279
movement was detected in their network

612
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,520
so

613
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,679
they're looking for the for

614
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,880
their

615
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,600
four victims

616
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,200
and some example for one organization's

617
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
easy hacked simple

618
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,600
people do not update microsoft exchange

619
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,840
server

620
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,240
for persistent in in the network they

621
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,559
create

622
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,320
ssh tunnels and proxy network

623
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,600
they

624
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,440
use stowaway

625
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,799
very often

626
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:37,210
for

627
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,360
[Music]

628
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,600
for these needs

629
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,640
and

630
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,320
in pocket for

631
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,480
lateral movement and command execution

632
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,840
on other servers

633
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,760
after

634
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,760
they collect data

635
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,840
after they

636
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,720
do all things or they need the final

637
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,679
this is

638
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,559
destructive activity to the network is

639
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,720
the final their goal

640
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,760
and

641
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,240
unfortunately

642
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,320
we have many cases

643
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,679
where their

644
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,159
succeed

645
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,799
also this organization

646
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,960
was attacked uh was attack

647
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,240
attacked

648
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,480
there

649
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,919
one of the ukrainian power plant where

650
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,159
we find uh in destroyer 2

651
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,440
it was

652
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,720
interesting

653
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,840
interesting

654
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,279
story

655
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,240
how they move in

656
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,640
but how they moving

657
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,919
how they

658
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,240
have any additional access

659
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,440
access

660
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,520
through the vulnerability exploitation

661
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,679
of their web resources

662
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:10,559
but

663
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,039
in this

664
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,320
case

665
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,439
we find found

666
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,720
different

667
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,640
new wipers wipers created especially for

668
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,399
solaris systems

669
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,799
wipers create especially for linux

670
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,159
systems

671
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,480
and

672
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,159
the viper created especially for

673
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,200
industrial control systems

674
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,679
created

675
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,679
with knowledge of

676
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,919
software that use it

677
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,600
in ukraine

678
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,000
power plants

679
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,719
zero

680
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,320
another

681
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,640
trend is efficient attacks but it's

682
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,919
always trend as you can see this is the

683
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,240
most large

684
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,960
numbers of incidents with the fishing

685
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,000
targeting all

686
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,559
they fish google service they fish

687
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,799
zimbra

688
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,520
they fish government organizations they

689
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,600
create a domains

690
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,320
like post-support bees and on these

691
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,600
damages they create a lot of different

692
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,719
subdomains like here

693
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,200
create many many different fishing pages

694
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,520
for especially for target organization

695
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,039
one new thing that we see

696
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,440
that many of phishing page created on

697
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,720
the legitimate resources

698
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
so

699
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,080
for example we detect some groups like

700
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,200
armageddon and they like to use

701
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,919
domains they hands on dot sight

702
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:06,960
so

703
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,159
we decided on the

704
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,880
firewalls on the

705
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,480
ids ips

706
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,000
block all domains which ends with side

707
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,679
but at this point

708
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:20,559
when

709

lovely week's

713
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,240
etsy

714

ml

716
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,679
software

717
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,200
for example

718
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,480
quickly this is the vulnerability of the

719
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,960
zimbra if i

720
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,640
when exploitation of the vulnerability

721
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,440
uh gives a possibility to

722
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,559
hackers receive a last 5

723
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,120
500 emails that were received by the

victim

725
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,320
and then the

726
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,080
vulnerability

727
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,880
by zimbra also

728
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,559
in which provide

729
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,519
when you

730
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,600
when victim open the letter in the

731
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,440
zimbra web application

732
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,399
uh

733
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,799
the javascript create a forward

734
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,840
forwarding

735
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,880
and forwarding call messages to the some

736
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,519
other email

737
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,240
we also

738
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,840
they use our names for phishing attacks

739
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,799
after our publications

740
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,600
on site the actors like

741
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,880
this is

742
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,360
was fishing emails by the uac

743
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,159
apate29

744
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,919
they used our

745
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,600
label to

746
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,120
spread phishing

747
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,200
you see they write like

748
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,440
you need to scan your computers and

749
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,120
search your way

750
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,320
sell you

scanner.

752
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,200
also popular terms

753
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,679
about the war

754
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,679
information about the military

755
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,320

information about the

757
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,399
chemical attacks

758
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,640
on the ukrainian cities

759
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,440
so

760
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,919
the people is scary

761
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,799
people open open these links open these

762
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,960
are chiefs and get their computers

763
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,960
infected

764
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,919
also

765
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,720
such grouper macdon starting to provide

766
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,120
attacks

767
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,120
on the european institution this is the

768
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,518
attack on

769
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,320
latvian organization where they use

770
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,760
them of the military support of ukraine

771
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,760
and the domains

772
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,640
military ukraine site yeah armageddon

773
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,640
site

774
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,480
but we try to hunt these things

775
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,320
all domes with the

776
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,079
endings of the groups that we detect and

777
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,918
with wars military ukraine gov ua

778
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,760
and trying to block this before

779
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,599
they can

780
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,200
make some bad things with this

781
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,639
also

782
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,879
after one of our publications

783
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,000
the gamma redund group decided to create

784
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,679
a redirect

785
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,040
on their c2 server and

786
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,879
when payload was loaded from c2 server

787
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,079
site redirect there to our site set go

788
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,960
ua after

789
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,480
payload loaded

790
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,960
they connected to our site again at

791
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,760
first point we think oh cool now we can

792
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,400
see the peace of the victims

793
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,440
but

794
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,200
in two days our

795
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,160
ip of our site

796
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,200
was blacklisted by main

797
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,079
most most asp providers of the world and

798
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,280
it causes problems

799
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,280
so

800
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,160
they don't like our work and try to

801
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,280
to

802
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,800
to do bad things to us because

803
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,800
because

804
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,800
and in the last

805
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,520
all these incidents uh all these cyber

806
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,680
attacks all these actors

807
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,400
all all

808
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,000
all these

809
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,599
things

810
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,720
are

811
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,240
registered

812
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,480
are notified we work very closely with

813
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,560
general prosecutor office of ukraine

814
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,200
with state security service service

815
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,280
and all

816
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,760
all these

817
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,640
bad things that they do

818
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,839
we notice

819
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,800
and collect

820
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,359
half year ago the state security service

821
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,960
published information about the

822
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,400
actors

823
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,040
maridon or magdon and

824
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,119
this is their

825
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,280
heads their stuff

826
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,240
and

827
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,760
one thing why

828
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,800
they

829
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,760
their tax on ukraine is so successful

830
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,680
because the half of the members of the

831
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,720
camera don is

832
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,680
members of the state security service of

833
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,800
ukraine

834
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,760
they're situated in crimea and there was

835
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,000
traders and go to the fsb

836
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,240
but

837
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,078
their names are notepads

838
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,280
the lesson learned from this far is that

839
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,160
as i say cyberspace is really the field

840
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,359
of war

841
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,160
the impact

842
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,000
the

843
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,280
number of cyber attacks will grow

844
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,280
yesterday we

845
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,720
provide investigation in one

846
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,359
organization and we find a new caddy

847
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,960
viper

848
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,480
modification

849
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,400
maybe we will post about this later

850
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,240
but

851
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,880
the damage from cyber attacks is

852
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,079
enormous

853
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,240
in the political information and

854
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,680
financial component

855
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,560
we need to change our approach

856
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,520
to responsibility for cyber security

857
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,400
in our country

858
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,119
and

859
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,440
we learn

860
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,680
how

861
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,520
to communicate with

862
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,839
other organizations in question of

863
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,960
incident investigation

864
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,040
and

865
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,079
at this time we very close interact uh

866
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,119
with

867
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,880
certain other third teams around the

868
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,200
world with main cyber security vendors

869
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,599
with government institution independent

870
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,839
researcher volunteers around the world

871
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,720
all of them provide us a big help

872
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,079
and we very appreciate this we were

873
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,640
grateful for this and thank

874
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,000
to all teams to all companies who

875
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,119
support us in this

876
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,960
in this

877
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,920
war

878
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,480
thank you for your attention

879
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,760
uh

880
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,160
thank you very much for this very

881
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,800
interesting presentation and i can add

882
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,359
that of course you can see a lot of

883
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,480
other details on aocs on the website of

884
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,000
cert ua

885
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,240

uh

916
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,560
it was a

917
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,720
very tough beginning of this war and uh

918
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,200
a huge case with the biosex hack

919
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,079
uh

920
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,520
which happened in the first hours for

921
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,000
dean laos to provide full investigation

922
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,160
of this case and uh later statement

923
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,720
which was made by 27 countries regarding

924
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,400
this case and

925
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,440
recognition of russia as a

926
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,400
aggressor in cyberspace

927
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,160
happened because because we were

928
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,800
provided with the

929
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,119
attribution with enough

930
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,760
facts and proofs about this case and in

931
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,720
the this first day for it was very

932
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,040
difficult for us to uh to

933
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,359
re uh provide response and to provide

934
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,079
further investigation and uh i'm telling

935
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,480
this that uh

936
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,319
there was some difficult conditions of

937
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:44,160
course and uh we we needed to

938
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,480
re-engineer our business process insert

939
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,960
and triple sap

940
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,359
in in general so

941
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,599
our servicemen moved to new locations

942
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,680
and we established remote work

943
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,640
concentrating on keeping our people safe

944
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,520
but with regards to resources of course

945
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,280
we feel a

946
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,119
huge support from

947
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,240
other teams from global i.t

948
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,920
providers from governments so this is

949
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,920
this is really available and

950
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,160
it's difficult to underestimate this

951
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,480
help

952
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,720
