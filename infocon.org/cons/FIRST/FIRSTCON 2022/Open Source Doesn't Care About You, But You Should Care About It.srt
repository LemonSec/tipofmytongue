1
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,639
so please keep in mind we'll have a

2
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,040
short q a session after the talk and we

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,520
have microphones lined up there and

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,680
there so if a question please go to the

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,279
microphone

6
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,080
there is also a survey in the app so do

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,920
the speakers a favor and fill out the

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,080
survey in the official first app after

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,720
the talk and if you have any devices on

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,120
you that somehow make noises please be

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,760
so kind and turn them off now

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,840
and now for the first talk of the

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,640
afternoon here is uh crop he's the

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,960
director of security communications at

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,680
intel product assurance and security and

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,480
he's also active in the first pset

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,960
services framework and the lead of the

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,199
open source security foundation

19
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,079
and open source is also a big topic of

20
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,719
his talk he has a very cool presentation

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,840
design he has a lot of cats so everyone

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,159
please give him a wall welcome and the

23
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,000
stage is yours thank you natalie

24
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,439
hey everybody

25
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,560
i'm krobe

26
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,799
uh i do stuff we'll see a little slide

27
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,159
about me in a minute

28
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,600
uh while we're

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,000
thinking about this presentation this

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,520
topic of open source i wanted to pull

31
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,200
the room a little bit

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,360
so who here in the room raise your hand

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,920
if you represent a piecert a product

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,479
security team

35
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,320
okay lower your hands who here

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,720
represents a corporate or computer

37
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,920
security team a c-cert

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,640
okay academic

39
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,479
other

40
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,439
so

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,119
pretty even mix of c-certs and p-certs

42
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,079
i am here representing the open source

43
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,119
ecosystem the maintainer persona

44
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,320
we'll talk about a couple different

45
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,719
personas here in this room piecerts

46
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,759
would be typically a supplier persona

47
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,320
and sea certs you all get to be probably

48
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,240
the consumer persona because you

49
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,159
probably aren't doing the work in

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,160
upstream but you definitely benefit

51
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,720
through products and services

52
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,720
i've had the great fortune to do open

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,560
source security for under a decade

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,680
pretty close

55
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,760
and i've done a bunch of nonsense you

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,440
can see up here

57
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,599
while making this presentation

58
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,000
i was think trying to find a theme i was

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,800
going to hand illustrate each slide and

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,640
i said man that's a lot of work

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,440
and so i'm i had a crappy powerpoint

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,959
presentation deck

63
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,599
and then my cat walked in and started

64
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,720
yelling at me demanding to be fed

65
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,360
and that really inspired me because and

66
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,599
ultimately made the topic open source

67
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,360
doesn't care about you in general the

68
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,120
cat doesn't care too much about you

69
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,200
unless it needs fed or some of its other

70
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,840
needs need attended but you absolutely

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,200
should care about it

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,640
we're going to talk about kind of

73
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,640
understanding your open source problem

74
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,239
we're going to talk about how the open

75
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,200
source ecosystem really works and how

76
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,560
there's some differences with closed

77
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,720
source like if you get software from a

78
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,680
commercial vendor that's typically

79
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,360
going to be closed source software and

80
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,519
they function a little differently

81
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,560
we're going to talk about the open

82
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,400
source threat model and then we're going

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,480
to talk about some solutions because i'm

84
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,720
not just going to complain about stuff i

85
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,319
actually i'm going to help you solve the

86
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,680
problem

87
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,280
so in the room

88
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,440
how many people here know that they use

89
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,239
open source at work

90
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,480
i see some hands not raised

91
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,280
you're

92
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,920
you're fooling yourselves all right

93
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,080
how many people think you know all the

94
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,200
open source you use

95
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,599
right answer

96
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,440
the answer is not everybody knows

97
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,519
everything they use

98
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,120
who here gets an s-bomb from their

99
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,760
suppliers

100
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,440
wicked

101
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,360
zero people alan friedman is out in the

102
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,560
hallway crying right now

103
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,439
so obviously if you don't have an s bomb

104
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,680
you can't use it to try together

105
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,680
uh vulnerability information so you i'm

106
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,360
not able to solve that problem at this

107
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,519
point without having the s-bomb

108
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,159
so let's talk about open source

109
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,519
uh

110
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,200
i worked at red hat for a substantial

111
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,480
part of my career

112
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,680
and i always thought about the

113
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,600
engineering teams as kind of hippie

114
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,798
cowboys

115
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:19,918
they're off

116
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,759
on their own out on the range doing

117
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,440
their own thing

118
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,160
a little strange but generally they mean

119
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,320
well and when you think about developers

120
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,440
developers have a lot of different

121
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,040
motivations there's a lot of different

122
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,320
ways to look and you know

123
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,600
perceive

124
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,759
the open source developer

125
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,280
so we'll talk about there are many

126
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,280
different unique goals of open source

127
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,479
projects

128
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,720
not there is no monolithic the open

129
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,479
source everybody functions a little

130
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,600
differently

131
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,520
some people get into open source and

132
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,600
this is the key reason most people get

133
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,680
into open source is they want need to

134
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,600
solve a problem and they solve that

135
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,320
problem through creative software but

136
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,160
also you have people doing academic

137
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,080
projects at universities they'll get

138
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,840
their mass you know bachelor's master's

139
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,160
doctorate then software engineering so

140
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,960
they'll have projects on open source

141
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
many people do open source because they

142
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,199
want to be build and be part of a

143
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,240
community

144
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,919
it's amazing the

145
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,840
the sense of purpose and well-being you

146
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,960
get in an active nurturing community

147
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,479
a lot of people do open source because

148
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,840
they want to have fun or they're

149
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,440
teaching themselves some new skills

150
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,199
some people want recognition from their

151
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,400
peers i wrote the absolute greatest

152
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,320
encryption algorithm ever look at me i'm

153
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,759
so amazing

154
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,000
other people feel that they because they

155
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
use open source they feel that they

156
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,600
should contribute back to that open

157
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,919
source

158
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,479
some others just generally agree with

159
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,800
the altruistic mission of free and open

160
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,039
source software software that's created

161
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,720
for the public good

162
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,240
but then you have some people that

163
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,000
contribute to that because it's going to

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,520
help their career i'm going to get a

165
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,919
promotion because i have you know x many

166
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,000
projects in github and so many stars and

167
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,199
whatnot

168
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,360
and then the very last category of why

169
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,720
people can

170
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,759
contribute to open source is some people

171
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,680
get paid by their company to do this

172
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,600
work

173
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,680
and that is the reality there's a lot of

174
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,680
different complex motivations some

175
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,120
people may have

176
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120
one or two of these motivations some

177
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,639
could have all

178
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,120
but the open source is not very cut and

179
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,039
dry not very black and white

180
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,639
but one thing if you take nothing else

181
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,120
away from this talk aside from cats are

182
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,080
great

183
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,120
is a substantial amount of commercial

184
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,000
software today uses and is based off of

185
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,520
open source

186
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,680
uh depending on the day of the week and

187
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,400
the study that you read between 80 and

188
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
upwards of 91

189
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,199
of all commercial software has

190
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,000
major components that are free and open

191
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,039
source

192
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,240
and

193
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,039
uh

194
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,960
this xkcd

195
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,840
cartoon very humorously illustrates

196
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
humorous uh the fact that there's a lot

197
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,919
of stuff in your environment and then

198
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,360
there's this one little project that

199
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,680
hasn't been touched since 2003 that you

200
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,560
probably don't know about

201
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,440
so you know my first controversial

202
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,280
statement here you can read it on the

203
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,240
screen

204
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,000
but by using open source software you

205
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,400
are knowingly benefiting from someone

206
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,000
else's work and not paying for it and

207
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,160
that's okay open source again is

208
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,160
generally created for the common good or

209
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,800
to solve a developer's personal problem

210
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,720
but the developer's personal problem and

211
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,880
this altruistic nature

212
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,440
does not service your needs you did not

213
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,680
pay for this there is no contract

214
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,759
between you and the developer in fact if

215
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,680
you read most almost all open source

216
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,319
licenses they state as is

217
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,919
so there is no obligation from the

218
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,840
developer to do anything to their

219
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,599
downstream community

220
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,720
but you know your business

221
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,639
and that's that's fine that's how the

222
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,720
ecosystem works

223
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,240
but you need to understand that these

224
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,319
development these upstream goals don't

225
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,919
necessarily align with your business

226
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,560
objectives and the fact that

227
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,400
they have a release schedule and you

228
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,680
have a different release schedule and

229
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,599
they're out of sync it's not really the

230
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,919
upstream maintainers problem that's your

231
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,080
problem to try to understand and under

232
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,319
make compensating controls to deal with

233
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,400
that

234
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,199
so what does open source do for you i

235
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,800
have a couple things here to tell you

236
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,080
what open source

237
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,039
doesn't do for you

238
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,958
first and foremost open source never

239
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,479
gave you a support contract

240
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,919
upstream maintainers aren't in the

241
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,440
business of supporting your business or

242
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,200
your software

243
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,760
you may pay a commercial vendor for open

244
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,360
source support and that's cool there's a

245
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,519
contract there you have some rights and

246
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,040
they have some obligations there but

247
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,399
upstream does not have that obligation

248
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,480
open source doesn't care that you have

249
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,880
dependency conflicts or you have a

250
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,040
critical system you can't take down to

251
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,360
patch or you can't update to the next

252
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,839
version because of dependency conflicts

253
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,680
that's not there they are there to

254
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,920
create their software and move along

255
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,839
solve their problems and you are able to

256
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,000
benefit from that

257
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,560
open source doesn't care that you gave

258
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,240
your customers a 10-year support

259
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,000
contract

260
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,440
generally

261
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,640
open source is focused on n minus one

262
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,040
versions so they will support the latest

263
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,440
version and the version right behind

264
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,360
that that came out right before it and

265
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,120
that's it that's your expectation from

266
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,800
open source most open source projects

267
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,880
they don't do this long-term support

268
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
there is some other commercial entity

269
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,040
that if you need this they can step in

270
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,120
and try to fill that gap for you or you

271
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,880
need to take that responsibility on

272
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,880
yourself if you need to support a really

273
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,839
long life product

274
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,000
open source also doesn't care that you

275
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,920
can't upgrade the latest version because

276
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,320
that is almost always the fix in open

277
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,240
source upgrade to the next version

278
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,279
please

279
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,040
because i'm not paid to support this i'm

280
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,720
going to support the latest thing so

281
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,160
again it's up to you to figure out how

282
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,440
you're going to protect yourself and

283
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,440
your customers your constituents

284
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,680
and finally open source doesn't know and

285
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,640
open source doesn't care how you cobbled

286
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,440
together your solution in your

287
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,760
environment on your equipment with all

288
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,519
this other software

289
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,959
they don't care they're not there to

290
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,440
support that that is on you your system

291
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,120
integrator or your vendors that are

292
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,079
supporting you so don't ask open source

293
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,959
to help you troubleshoot your amazon

294
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,160
cloud instance of nonsense because they

295
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,240
they don't do that that's up to you to

296
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,480
figure out how to do that

297
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,680
so how open source really works

298
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,120
typically a developer has a a problem

299
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,959
they're trying to solve so they'll

300
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,160
lovingly

301
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,800
develop this awesome thing then they'll

302
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,240
share it with the world you know again

303
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,600
sometimes just for recognition you know

304
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,920
look at me i did this amazing thing or

305
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,200
sometimes it's i want to help a

306
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,519
community or they're just pushing it out

307
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,720
there because they don't they don't want

308
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,399
recognition but they want to generally

309
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,079
help the world

310
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,160
then you know that developer after

311
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,920
they've shared this pride and joy with

312
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,600
the universe they kind of wander off and

313
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,920
do other stuff but then other people

314
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,320
discover this amazing gift that open

315
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,920
source person gave the world they go

316
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,279
this is great

317
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,560
this is this solves my problem except i

318
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,200
need blah blah blah and blah i need all

319
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,120
these additional functions or these

320
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,880
additional features or i need it to

321
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,399
behave differently or i need the screen

322
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,360
to be green not blue

323
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,880
and

324
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,040
the great way how open source should

325
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,760
work is as you find these

326
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,160
personal deficiencies with that software

327
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,839
you're supposed to contribute and give

328
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:46,640
back

329
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,519
hey

330
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,000
you submit a pr or you open an issue

331
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,079
saying i found this problem could be

332
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,160
could you change the behavior to do from

333
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,360
this to that

334
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,360
or better yet best of all here's a patch

335
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,519
to fix this bug i saw on your product

336
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,839
your your software could you please

337
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,600
integrate that into the main branch

338
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,040
that's how open source is supposed to

339
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,560
work

340
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,560
this is how many suppliers treat open

341
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,120
source they see this beautiful project

342
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,720
out there on the internet they don't

343
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,959
have to pay anything they incorporate it

344
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,040
into their products and this is what you

345
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,720
get

346
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,079
so i'll let you

347
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,839
admire that while i take a sip of water

348
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,040
many commercial suppliers do not

349
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,720
participate in the communities of

350
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,040
software that they use

351
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,519
and they all

352
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,519
depending rarely

353
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,839
contribute patches back or any kind of

354
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,959
resources back to help that community

355
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,240
there's a lot of different ways you can

356
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,560
engage with communities to support them

357
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,680
beyond

358
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,079
money

359
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,200
so unfortunately being that open source

360
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,480
is out there and it's beautiful and

361
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,600
delightful

362
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,519
it also can become interesting to

363
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,079
attackers

364
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,959
the all of our source code is fully

365
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,440
publicly viewable which is awesome so

366
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,600
you can take that software

367
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,839
look at it understand exactly what it

368
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,200
does

369
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,880
so can the bad guys unfortunately

370
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,720
it is typically most open source

371
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,240
communities those that aren't like

372
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,200
single contributors tend to be globally

373
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,079
distributed where patches are welcome no

374
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,839
matter what part of the world is no

375
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,360
matter what your

376
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,200
sexual orientation is what nation you

377
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,480
live in we will take patches from

378
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,720
anywhere and there are generally some

379
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,200
rules vetting getting things into the

380
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,920
main branch but open source development

381
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,560
is geographically distributed they are

382
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,920
rarely a

383
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,000
small group of people in one spot that

384
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,959
does this so that's a nice

385
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,040
avenue that attackers could potentially

386
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,720
infiltrate that community because there

387
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,040
isn't these tight controls and tight

388
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,480
circle of trust between these people

389
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,920
because many of the transactions that

390
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,880
open source are done anonymously

391
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,639
uh there are different economic

392
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,320
incentives and feedback loops um so when

393
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,519
you're thinking about enterprise

394
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,760
software attackers

395
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,680
generally want to get in there because

396
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,199
they want to

397
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,839
install ransomware and they want to

398
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,440
threaten you or they want to siphon off

399
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,199
corporate secrets

400
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,120
within open source the motivations for

401
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,760
the attackers are can be very different

402
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,600
and also can be a lot broader think of

403
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,920
things like the solarwinds attack where

404
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,800
a compromised package was able to help

405
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,480
unfortunately get integrated into many

406
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,079
supply chains and that the scope of a

407
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,760
potential attack if you're doing kind of

408
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,160
a poisoning the well type thing

409
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,600
is potentially broader than just

410
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,639
attacking

411
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,440
large bank or government office

412
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,760
and it draws different types of threat

413
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,600
actors

414
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,240
what is almost universally applicable is

415
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,120
that open source projects have a lack of

416
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,600
have a scarcity of resources they might

417
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,839
have limited

418
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,199
development environments they might have

419
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,760
limited peer developers they might not

420
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,800
have access to expensive corporate tools

421
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,160
again because a lot of them don't get

422
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,480
directly paid to do that thing

423
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,920
so that

424
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,120
brings in some problems if you're

425
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,639
looking at software from a more

426
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,639
traditional commercial enterprise they

427
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,800
typically do have you know very well

428
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,959
managed developer environments they have

429
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,399
things like sdlc or they have scanning

430
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,160
and other protections whereas an open

431
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,440
source because it's all out in the

432
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,360
public they don't necessarily have all

433
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,199
these some of them do some some

434
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,680
organizations some projects do sdl very

435
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,079
well and have very tightly controlled ci

436
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,079
cd infrastructure

437
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,759
others don't

438
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,759
and unfortunately and that that kind of

439
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,680
draws into the very last point there's a

440
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,839
real lack of consistency you can't look

441
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,240
at one open source project and directly

442
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,000
compare it to another because there's a

443
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,759
lot of different factors they could have

444
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,600
different skilled developers on each

445
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,759
project they could have different access

446
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,320
to testing infrastructure or tooling

447
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,000
and that is you know the unfortunate

448
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,600
reality of open source is that not

449
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,279
everybody's equal not everyone has

450
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,440
access to all these amazing platforms

451
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,839
and amazing tools

452
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:06,800
so

453
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,639
how security vulnerabilities get

454
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,639
addressed in different communities and

455
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,920
it really depends on the type of

456
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,839
community you're looking at

457
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,839
so if you have

458
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,360
so if you're a supplier you're

459
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,199
potentially downloading thousands of

460
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,360
open source packages if you're a

461
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,279
consumer maybe you are

462
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,120
a build-it shop maybe you're a bank and

463
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,279
you write your own um

464
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,199
online banking platform so you will

465
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,440
actively download and participate in

466
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,560
open source

467
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,079
but there's a lot of different types of

468
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,480
communities within open source the first

469
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,399
model and this is unfortunately

470
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,000
depending on some language ecosystems

471
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,800
a

472
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,360
peer of mine josh bressers is doing

473
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,880
analysis of maven and npm and the go

474
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,759
communities and the overwhelming reality

475
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,240
in those communities is that this single

476
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,440
maintainer

477
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,000
there's one maintainer that does that

478
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,240
software and that's it and these are

479
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,320
millions of packages and when you have

480
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,959
an individual contributor style solution

481
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,720
you're looking at one to two people this

482
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,959
tends to be a passion project

483
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,720
uh you're going to have little to no

484
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,480
process because these folks are doing it

485
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,240
for fun or they have to try to so they

486
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,599
have a quick fix and they throw it out

487
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,119
there to share

488
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,400
there's likely

489
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,199
no formal or secure means of sharing

490
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,199
security related information normally

491
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,520
they might have an email address

492
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,039
they're not going to have access to a

493
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,520
secure jira or bug tracking system

494
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,280
they're not going to use private gitlab

495
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,360
github issues

496
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,919
there's definitely no slas on the review

497
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,080
it's kind of buyer beware you download

498
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,440
the software there's probably not going

499
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,120
to be a lot of expectation on how you

500
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,640
can get support

501
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,760
and

502
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,480
they have minimal if any documented

503
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,400
devsecops practices

504
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,880
if you're lucky you get a man page or a

505
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,480
readme file that kind of describes

506
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,799
things and that's probably as good as

507
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:55,679
you're going to get in some of these

508
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,160
smaller projects and this is a large

509
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,600
percentage of open source software

510
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,880
that's used today

511
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,400
and especially in things like maven and

512
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,240
go and some of the newer more modern

513
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,720
languages

514
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,720
in the middle stands kind of project or

515
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,039
community focused efforts so

516
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,280
this particular piece of software has

517
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,200
been able to capture the interest of

518
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
enough other developers that you have a

519
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,880
group of people doing this you could

520
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,400
have um

521
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,720
half dozen a dozen 20 or so folks

522
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,880
actively contributing to this project

523
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,120
they will have basic processes because

524
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,960
when you're trying to integrate commits

525
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,720
from different developers you just have

526
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,160
to have that process otherwise you get

527
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,600
collisions and everyone's stomping on

528
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,520
each other

529
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,440
they probably will have some type of

530
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,160
page that lists their contacts or like

531
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,400
what the rules of that community is how

532
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,840
to get a hold of them

533
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,440
and they pro they definitely will have

534
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,840
some type of bug review process so as

535
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,440
defects or security vulnerabilities

536
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
reported they'll have a way to triage

537
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,400
that

538
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,640
uh they'll probably have

539
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,760
that guy

540
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,160
or you know sally our devops gal she

541
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,559
manages the ci system they'll have

542
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,160
typically a handful of people that are

543
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,919
focused on some type of

544
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,360
formalized devsec ops practices

545
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,120
and uh they'll definitely will have

546
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,799
documentation because once you have more

547
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,240
than two people you really need to have

548
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,840
this documentation

549
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,600
and it helps so they will share that

550
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,679
with their broader ecosystem

551
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,200
you still should accept best effort

552
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,280
coordination expect best effort

553
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,559
coordination

554
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,400
and they might have cvd practices with

555
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,280
some key either suppliers maybe they

556
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,640
depend on something upstream so they've

557
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,080
made an arrangement to get

558
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,400
pre-notification for example or they may

559
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,000
understand that we have these four or

560
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,679
five downstream projects that depend on

561
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,200
us so we'll notify them but this is not

562
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,120
generally formalized or mature in a lot

563
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,799
of ways

564
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,640
and then the last type of open source

565
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,160
project you can have is like a

566
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,840
foundation level project these are

567
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,679
things like kernel

568
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,120
apache security kubernetes openstack

569
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,559
these large very mature programs with

570
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,400
these types of open source projects

571
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,559
you're going to have a dedicated team of

572
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,039
security people that typically oversee

573
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,039
that project there's going to be

574
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,880
oftentimes many different related

575
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,720
projects i can't remember

576
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,120
the kubernetes team told me last week

577
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,799
how many projects they had underneath

578
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,080
their umbrella and it was in the

579
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,000
hundreds of they're kind of managed

580
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,919
under this umbrella so that's very big

581
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,919
requires a lot of coordination

582
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,120
high maturity style project there

583
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,240
so with that you're going to have

584
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,480
well-developed documentation in process

585
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,520
you're going to have

586
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,360
well-communicated and well-documented

587
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,760
communication channels this is how this

588
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
is our security policy this is how we

589
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,159
want to intake issues these are slas

590
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,400
people can expect for a response and

591
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,679
generally kind of what our patching

592
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,360
methodology is these larger communities

593
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,440
will have all this documented

594
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,600
you'll have dedicated people performing

595
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,840
compose build deployment and security

596
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,600
functions within that project they're

597
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,799
going to have documented release

598
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,960
timelines and they very typically will

599
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,159
have a well thought out cvd process and

600
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,600
will be well integrated with other

601
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,960
communities they depend on or supply

602
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,600
so again there is no one the open source

603
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,360
you'll see any mixture of this so no one

604
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,960
kind of puts a sign up saying you know

605
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,200
we're foundation level or we're an ic

606
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,000
style project

607
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,799
generically oh i have a laser

608
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,880
oh it's a green laser too nice um

609
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,360
generically open source projects will

610
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,480
follow a very simple

611
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,240
ingestion triage and disposition process

612
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,400
some type of somehow some way a security

613
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,799
flaw is discovered somebody reports it

614
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,480
they're going to evaluate it

615
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,080
they're going to do something and it's

616
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,720
generally fixed or won't fix if they fix

617
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,159
it great the patch is thrown out in the

618
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,440
world and the developer moves on with

619
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,120
their life

620
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,840
this whole second half of the screen

621
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,080
second two thirds this is your

622
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,559
downstream suppliers

623
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,480
and what they have to do

624
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,360
to support that change upstream

625
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,360
and the worst situation

626
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,840
is when you get into a won't fix

627
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
scenario with upstream and your

628
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,760
commercial supplier has some type of

629
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,480
long life support plan in place for you

630
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,559
so that becomes an interesting little

631
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,000
exercise in negotiation

632
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,720
upstream

633
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,440
not upstream

634
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,760
so kind of comparing the two when you're

635
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,400
looking at closed versus open source

636
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,520
typically closed source will support is

637
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,440
supported by some corporate entity or

638
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,440
entities and

639
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,039
updates will typically only come for

640
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,360
that one supplier versus open source

641
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,120
where it's supported by the community

642
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,799
update could come from anywhere anyone

643
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,880
that has the interest and ability to

644
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,480
push a patch

645
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,159
potentially can help contribute to fix a

646
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,760
solution

647
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,600
for closed source they're typically

648
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,559
governed by stakeholders regulations

649
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,400
and they have customer demands so

650
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,919
they're going to be reactive to

651
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,840
customers so if you are supplied open

652
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,919
source software by a commercial software

653
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,320
vendor you have ability to influence

654
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,039
their roadmap influence how then

655
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,679
when and why they fix things

656
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,240
versus open source uh there generally is

657
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,039
little or no governance and they they do

658
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,640
open the open source does not have

659
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,880
regulatory oversight they are not

660
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,960
beholden to pci

661
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,480
um gdpr yes um but the generally the

662
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,360
typical regulation things are not

663
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,760
compelling to open source because again

664
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,919
they're not a commercial entity and

665
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,320
generally as i mentioned up here with

666
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,400
number one a lot of times

667
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,679
when you're dealing with people in open

668
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,880
source you don't even get their real

669
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,720
names we use hacker handles or

670
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,919
pseudonyms

671
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,400
very typical in this community so if you

672
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,159
are an organization that

673
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,279
some

674
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,400
nations like to state we will we only

675
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,520
like software created in x or y region

676
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,559
from people from a or b country

677
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,240
you don't have that luxury within open

678
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,559
source just because of that the open

679
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,720
global nature of it

680
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,480
looking at closed source

681
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,159
they generally have a process around

682
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,679
security reports

683
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,080
and communication is not always done in

684
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,000
public

685
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,520
oftentimes with commercial software

686
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,279
you'll see embargoes where there'll be

687
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,440
some type of period where that supplier

688
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
needs to get all their ducks in a row

689
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,279
and release an update

690
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,320
versus

691
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,360
for better or worse open source

692
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,120
almost always the defect tracking

693
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,799
process is open

694
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,159
it's a very mature very large project

695
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,679
that has a private

696
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,520
disclosure process

697
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,360
and

698
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,480
almost

699
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,720
to a fault all open source developers

700
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,799
are when the fix is ready it goes out

701
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,120
the door i'm pushing it immediately

702
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,720
because they're focused on their

703
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,400
downstream in this way they want to get

704
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,640
that fix out to their consumers whereas

705
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,279
commercial entities have a lot of other

706
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,279
uh constraints on them like you know

707
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,279
shareholder value and they can't

708
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,120
necessarily stop everything to release a

709
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,000
patch

710
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,320
this afternoon

711
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,080
when you're looking at

712
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,320
closed source generally those releases

713
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,400
are tied back to some predetermined

714
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,919
release schedule you have a quarterly

715
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,640
release cadence you have patch tuesday

716
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,480
whereas open source is again you know

717
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,919
screw it when it's done it's done it's

718
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,000
going out the door great good luck we

719
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,799
hope you all are happy with the software

720
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,720
around and then five typically with a

721
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,080
commercial vendor they'll try to

722
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,520
orchestrate updates especially if

723
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,960
there's any kind of interdependencies

724
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,320
between vendors

725
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,360
and they're

726
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,960
looking at the open source counterparts

727
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,720
there typically isn't a lot of that

728
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,880
understanding of

729
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,960
who ingests them and who we need to

730
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,480
notify so you're it's going to be much

731
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,880
less coordinated 10 minutes no way

732
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,080
oh man

733
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,559
all right here is a non-exhaustive list

734
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,640
of threats that could happen within an

735
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,440
open source ecosystem

736
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,320
very exciting

737
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,120
because on the internet no one knows

738
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,679
you're a cat

739
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,279
i'll tell you the story behind that in

740
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,279
the future uh so

741
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,480
when you're thinking about how a lot of

742
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,600
commercial suppliers support open source

743
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,000
it's not really great they don't really

744
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
do a ton of effort to help improve that

745
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,440
maintainers

746
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,360
ability to execute and deliver software

747
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,799
more quickly

748
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,720
so how can suppliers work better with

749
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,200
open source first and foremost

750
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,440
it should be the obligation of every

751
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,960
commercial supplier to understand every

752
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,440
piece of software that is delivered in

753
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,600
an offering they supply to someone that

754
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,039
pays money for it

755
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,679
that should be the first thing that any

756
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,520
well-intended company should do is

757
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,840
understanding what i'm ingesting

758
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,840
where i got it from what the rules of

759
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,159
that community are if i need to request

760
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,600
a change

761
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,279
you also need to understand how issues

762
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,720
are worked upstream

763
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,840
some issue some i said some communities

764
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,480
are we only have a public defect tracker

765
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,960
so if a researcher submits a security

766
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,520
vulnerability the world can see it which

767
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,279
as a defender you know the clock starts

768
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,039
ticking right there

769
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,440
others are more minimal more mature more

770
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,200
understanding of their downstores their

771
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,360
downstream ecosystem so they will have

772
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,919
practices that allow them to take some

773
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,760
issues in privately kind of triage it

774
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,279
beforehand before working on a release

775
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,760
suppliers need to understand

776
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,679
how patches are released by that project

777
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,840
is it pushed out on github is it out on

778
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,720
some random aws file system they

779
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,159
understand how that community works

780
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,440
where they're putting their software and

781
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,240
how they can get notified of it

782
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,000
a lot of times advisories are not

783
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,919
something that upstream communities do

784
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:40,960
so the

785
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,880
downstream consumers like suppliers need

786
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,880
to understand how they get notified and

787
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,720
how they need to notify their consumers

788
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,919
so let's talk really quickly about this

789
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,120
thing

790
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,039
who here has heard of log4j

791
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,159
so my perspective

792
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,320
the upstream apache team the security

793
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,159
team while not perfect

794
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,559
did an admirable job they did they

795
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,080
handled this vulnerability to the best

796
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,360
of their ability under the constraints

797
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,279
they were given and they

798
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,679
actually executed pretty well

799
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,080
so on december 10th there was a cve

800
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,279
released

801
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,360
very bad oh cvss 10. ooh scary so the

802
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,520
team within uh

803
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,279
the embargo broke

804
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,640
and they actually

805
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,120
the information got leaked by a vendor

806
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,080
that scraped github commits so somebody

807
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,440
started tweeting there's gonna be a big

808
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,799
apache event

809
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:35,760
so

810
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,080
six hours from that embargo leak the

811
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,559
apache community had the bolton out had

812
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,960
patches ready and it notified their main

813
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,679
downstreams

814
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:46,960
unfortunately

815
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,080
the first fix wasn't complete which is

816
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,520
uh

817
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,120
can be common especially when you're

818
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
working under pressure and the fact that

819
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,440
things went about three or four days

820
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,919
early it was an incomplete fix

821
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,039
so

822
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,200
just four days later the apache team

823
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,520
released a second fix that closed up

824
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,039
that little hole that wasn't addressed

825
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,399
and you'll note

826
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,840
that what wasn't addressed was

827
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,080
non-default configurations so someone

828
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,760
altered the behavior of the software the

829
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,600
developer intended to make it work a

830
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,320
different way and but they generously

831
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,720
released a fix for that

832
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,480
then a couple days later oh there was

833
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,159
another issue so while they were

834
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,919
investigating or mediating this they

835
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,399
released they found more issues as part

836
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,799
of this response and they actually at

837
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,240
the end of the day for this particular

838
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,320
problem there were the two the main

839
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,399
issue the

840
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,279
incomplete fix and then two secondary

841
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,640
cves that were discovered

842
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,320
so to think about this

843
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,760
the reason that they leaked and they

844
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,000
went early is because they had evidence

845
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,480
of active exploit in the wild so they

846
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,919
did for the best interest of their

847
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,919
community released early and

848
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,440
unfortunately it was confusing not

849
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,520
everybody got the message in time

850
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,679
but they were still able to get

851
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,679
everything out within six hours which i

852
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,679
don't know many organizations have that

853
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,720
ability to spit a patch out that quickly

854
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,799
the security team published it within

855
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,039
hours yay

856
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,039
first patch wasn't sufficient

857
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,559
boo

858
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,799
uh orgs working on testing and rolling

859
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,720
out the initial uh integration and

860
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,559
testing of the patches had some rework

861
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,880
to do that's an unavoidable

862
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,799
uh after effect

863
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,640
if you are working with open source

864
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,320
software again the goal is to move

865
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,760
quickly as they can

866
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,600
so they move quickly and sometimes it

867
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,320
requires some rework downstream

868
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,600
and then what was really fun is some

869
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,960
vendors were supplying log4j version one

870
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,440
which was publicly deprecated five years

871
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,799
ago

872
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,760
and then they sent demand letters to the

873
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,919
log4j maintainers demanding them what

874
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,200
are they going to do to fix this

875
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,039
software that they had publicly said

876
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,399
five years ago we're not doing anything

877
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,919
with anymore

878
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,440
not cool

879
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,880
um

880
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,200
so the hope hopefully if you got nothing

881
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,640
else from log4j i'm gonna do questions

882
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,240
here in a minute if you take nothing

883
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,640
else from this you need to ask questions

884
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,480
of your vendors you need to understand

885
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,720
what software they're supplying you and

886
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
some of the practices of how things are

887
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,399
done

888
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,200
so i will my slide should be available

889
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,880
after the fact i'll make sure that they

890
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,080
post it up there but i have some

891
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,840
suggestions and first and foremost the

892
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840
best way you can fix this problem is by

893
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,000
contributing to software that you use

894
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,080
and contributing could be

895
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,679
having engineers participate in the

896
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,080
project fix or bug or two offer to help

897
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,519
do documentation help them with

898
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,919
advisories uh donate tooling so that

899
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,600
they can do this testing that downstream

900
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,519
consumers want

901
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,360
um

902
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,720
all right and there is somebody doing

903
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,080
something about this so the other group

904
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,600
i work a lot with is the open source

905
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,720
security

906
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,519
software foundation

907
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,320
say that fast five times um in response

908
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,240
to the executive order released by the

909
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,720
biden administration last fall the open

910
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,000
source uh

911
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,919
secure software foundation has released

912
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,000
a 10-point plan a mobilization plan on

913
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,440
how the foundation a group of volunteers

914
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,279
will be working on fixing some of these

915
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,720
problems

916
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,679
like

917
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,919
education risk assessment digital

918
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,399
signatures of software getting software

919
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,039
rewritten into memory safe languages

920
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,880
working on sharing data doing code

921
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,200
audits better scanning tools

922
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,240
i get to create an open source cert

923
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,559
yay me

924
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,399
and then you know s-bombs and improve

925
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,399
supply chain security so the industry is

926
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,399
working on this and we need your help if

927
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,919
you are interested in any of these

928
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,559
topics don't hesitate to reach out to

929
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,399
the foundation show up to a working

930
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,559
group meeting it's fully publicly

931
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,640
available everyone's welcome and then as

932
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,120
we're developing uh solutions like

933
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,399
academic scholarships and

934
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,640
s-bombs and pcert you'll be able to

935
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,840
participate and help shape those

936
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,760
solutions so by engaging open source the

937
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,360
right way

938
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,000
it can be pretty cool

939
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,080
so i think we have like three minutes

940
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,360
for questions

941
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,600
so what questions might have i inspired

942
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,799
the group

943
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,960
to have

944
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,760
did you learn a little

945
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,840
so if you have any questions please line

946
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,640
up about microphones and at first give

947
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,559
chris a wrong applause for his awesome

948
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,559
talk

949
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,279
hello uh i'm dog i'm not a programmer so

950
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,279
might be a stupid question

951
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,600
is there any system by which

952
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,640
one entity can in a way sign or approve

953
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,159
a piece of code

954
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,159
published by b entity

955
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,760
so that i can look at the code and i can

956
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,159
see oh entity a which i trust has

957
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,600
approved that code

958
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,519
so there is a project that the

959
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,679
foundation supports called sig store

960
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,440
that is all around

961
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,480
digital

962
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,960
identity of developers and code signing

963
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,480
and so you can get that pedigree in

964
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,399
providence and it's all kind of a

965
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,519
blockchain style repository so that once

966
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,080
that software is signed you can always

967
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,480
check the hash with the main repository

968
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,000
to be able to validate that so yes there

969
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,079
are tools that are coming and that are

970
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,599
um actually they just announced that

971
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,440
kubernetes is moving over to using sig

972
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,520
store so yes there are ways you can do

973
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,560
that

974
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,279
thanks you're welcome

975
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,040
is there a

976
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,359
a listing of open source projects in

977
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,399
danger

978
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,679
should you say

979
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,399
that are focusable undersupported or

980
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,359
where

981
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,679
where there would be a need for it which

982
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,760
are widely used

983
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,159
and where there would be actually a need

984
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,280
for

985
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,639
more support

986
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:43,760
on that

987
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,280
and what is the your opinions on on the

988
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,320
best ways of providing

989
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,440
financial support in into the general

990
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,599
open source security ecosystem is it

991
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,839
through that foundation or are there

992
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,440
other

993
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,079
projects on this area so to your first

994
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,359
question there is no

995
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,119
list of

996
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,760
known at-risk projects but there is the

997
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,040
converse

998
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,720
we partnered the linux foundation

999
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,640
partnered with harvard university and

1000
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,040
they did the harvard census ii so they

1001
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,000
ranked the top

1002
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,560
117

1003
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,920
most used most critical projects and

1004
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,560
that's what openssf is focusing in on to

1005
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,320
try to go in and do

1006
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
one-on-one developer code audits with

1007
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,160
these people trying to get them access

1008
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,880
to tools and whatnot so there isn't an

1009
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,040
at-risk list but there is a list of we

1010
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,359
know that these pieces of software are

1011
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,960
used a lot and we're going to focus in

1012
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,960
on it and then we're also focused on the

1013
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,280
next 10 000 projects where we have a

1014
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,280
project called alpha that's directly

1015
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,359
engaging the top 1 115 and then omega is

1016
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,599
trying to address the 10 000 below with

1017
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,119
what we learn on how to engage those

1018
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,720
projects kind of filtering those

1019
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,200
practices back to the larger ecosystem

1020
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,440
and openssf is one foundation that you

1021
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,760
potentially could partner with and you

1022
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,440
know again contributing doesn't

1023
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,280
necessarily need to be money

1024
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,359
but it could be that helps us get

1025
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,880
contractors or helps us buy tools or get

1026
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,599
moving infrastructure from

1027
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,920
i worked with a guy that had a

1028
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,240
array of raspberry pies underneath his

1029
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,240
desk in the netherlands we were able to

1030
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,599
help get him funding to be able to

1031
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,560
convert that into an aws kubernetes

1032
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,240
cluster so there are a lot of different

1033
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,320
ways so open ssf is one foundation but

1034
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,760
there's a lot of great foundations the

1035
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,920
cncf uh the confidential compute

1036
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,200
consortium

1037
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,640
a lot of different ways but if you have

1038
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,000
specific questions don't hesitate to

1039
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,440
come ask me afterwards

1040
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,280
good we have time for one more question

1041
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,960
did you like the cats

1042
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,079
