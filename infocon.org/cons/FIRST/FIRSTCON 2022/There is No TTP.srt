61
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,200
please help me welcome dr martin sage is

62
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,250
yours thank you

63
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:57,920
[Applause]

64
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,440
do not try

65
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,879
and detect the ttp

66
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,680
that's impossible

67
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,319
instead only try to realize the truth

68
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,239
there is no ttp

69
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,159
ttps

70
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,200
don't

71
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,839
exist

72
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,360
they are abstractions

73
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,599
constructs

74
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,879
that help us

75
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,440
understand

76
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,519
you cannot detect a ttp

77
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,760
you can only detect things that exist

78
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480
furthermore

79
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,200
there is no such thing as a ttp

80
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,319
it's either a tactic

81
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,200
a technique

82
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,560
or a procedure

83
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,239
to make this useful we need to be able

84
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,159
to tell the difference

85
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,000
we need to understand

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,080
what they are

87
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,480
and my opinion is that we

88
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,959
currently don't

89
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,160
know thyself

90
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,960
originally from the oracle of delphi

91
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,560
popularized

92
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,400
by the oracle in the matrix

93
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,440
to know yourself

94
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,919
also means to know your limitations

95
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,440
to know what you don't know

96
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,719
if we think that we know

97
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,360
then we stop searching

98
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,560
we stop asking questions

99
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,199
we do not progress

100
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,400
the only true wisdom

101
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,120
is in knowing you know nothing

102
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,479
this quote is attributed to socrates the

103
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,919
ancient greek philosopher

104
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,639
socrates was a master of annoying people

105
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,440
he would start talking to an expert

106
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,680
he would ask the expert for definitions

107
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,360
of key terms

108
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,759
and then he would keep asking questions

109
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,840
until the expert contradicted himself

110
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,479
thus being annoyed

111
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,240
but socrates goal

112
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,160
was to highlight

113
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,800
what we don't know

114
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,320
and that is my goal today to highlight

115
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,880
what we don't know and i'll start with a

116
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,000
story about myself

117
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,400
i started as a junior threat analyst

118
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,960
back in 2014

119
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,720
one of the first things that i noticed

120
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,680
was people using the term ttps

121
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,199
it seemed important so i tried to

122
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,840
understand what it

123
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,919
was i quickly figured out that

124
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,639
it's an abbreviation for tactics

125
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,160
techniques and procedures

126
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,319
but i didn't understand what each of

127
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,880
those meant

128
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,880
so i started to annoy people

129
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,160
whenever i heard someone say ttp

130
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
i would ask them could you give me an

131
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,560
example of a tactic

132
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,880
an example of a technique

133
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,319
and an example of a procedure

134
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,440
i never got any examples

135
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,039
until

136
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,680
a fellow threat analyst

137
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,840
pointed me in the direction of ryan

138
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,440
stillians ryan stillians published two

139
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,319
blog posts in 2014

140
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,280
one

141
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,360
on the detection maturity level model

142
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,199
and one on ttps

143
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,160
what he did was basically to take david

144
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,160
bianco's pyramid of pain

145
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,199
and then expand the ttp at the top

146
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,960
into tactics techniques and procedures

147
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,520
and he argued

148
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,440
that it's useful to view them separately

149
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,680
but in my opinion

150
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,880
the way ryan stillians defined tactics

151
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,080
techniques

152
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,840
and procedures

153
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,960
didn't make any sense

154
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,360
so i kept searching

155
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,680
then

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,120
in 2018

157
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,720
the big breakthrough happened

158
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,759
i don't have any fancy sound or lighting

159
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,280
effect so i'm going to need your help

160
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,479
try to imagine a choir of angels singing

161
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,240
a pillar of light descending from the

162
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,000
heavens and in the middle of that pillar

163
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,599
mitre attack

164
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,400
adversarial tactics techniques

165
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,359
and common knowledge

166
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,520
this was exactly what i had been looking

167
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,280
for

168
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,599
the knowledge base of my dreams the

169
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,440
framework that i would want to spend the

170
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,520
rest of my life with

171
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,359
so i immediately started using it

172
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,800
but over time

173
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,199
i had this nagging feeling of

174
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,080
missing pieces

175
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,840
of things not being quite right

176
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,760
and i saw

177
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,159
attack being used in ways that didn't

178
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,120
make any sense to me

179
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,958
and now i'm finally able to articulate

180
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:43,839
why

181
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,080
but before i tell you why

182
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,839
i would last i'd like to ask you a

183
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,160
couple of questions with raise of hands

184
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,800
how many of you have used mitre attack

185
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,519
in any way

186
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,120
that's most of you

187
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,600
thank you

188
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,399
how many of you have read the attack

189
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,880
design and philosophy paper

190
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,839
one

191
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:06,800
okay

192
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,279
good but still

193
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,760
fewer than those who use the fact if you

194
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,080
use attack in any way i strongly

195
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,120
recommend that you read it

196
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,519
it's really good and it clears up a lot

197
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,720
of the misconceptions and

198
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,880
misunderstandings about attack

199
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,959
now i went with the matrix as a theme

200
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,959
so we need a red pill and a blue pill

201
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,760
the blue pill

202
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,959
represents my impression of what people

203
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,800
in the security community think about

204
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,479
attack how they understand attack

205
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,720
this is based on discuss discussions

206
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,440
with customers vendors and peers on a

207
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,080
lot of reading

208
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,640
the red pill

209
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,920
represents

210
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,399
my understanding of what

211
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,279
how things really are

212
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,760
and this is based on my own experiences

213
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,319
with attack

214
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,760
the attack design and philosophy paper

215
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,399
discussions with peers

216
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,600
and also

217
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,959
a lot of reading so in short

218
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,800
the red pill is me and my understanding

219
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,720
and the blue pill

220
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,839
is my understanding of others

221
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,640
so which one do we pick

222
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,800
well why not do both

223
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,240
the structure of this talk is as follows

224
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,120
for each of tactics techniques and

225
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,680
procedures

226
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,560
i will first present the blue pill

227
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,079
then i will present the red pill

228
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,519
and finally

229
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,279
i will tell a short story with some

230
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,920
examples to illustrate

231
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,720
and now i'm going to test if the clicker

232
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,839
works from over here but let's start

233
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,360
with

234
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,839
tactics

235
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,959
mitre attack enumerates tactics

236
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,600
resource development initial access

237
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,920
execution persistence privilege

238
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,399
escalation defense evasion credential

239
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,560
access i couldn't put the rest of them

240
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,079
in there because the font would be too

241
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,360
small

242
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,720
but

243
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,320
yeah

244
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,880
it's all there

245
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,920
this is a solved problem

246
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,600
those are not tactics

247
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,160
they're tactical objectives

248
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,000
and or kill chain faces

249
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,560
do we even know what a tactic is in the

250
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,600
cybersecurity domain

251
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,279
we might never know because we think we

252
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,720
know

253
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,040
but where did ttps come from

254
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,519
originally

255
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,560
the military

256
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,040
what are military tactics

257
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,760
well some examples of military offensive

258
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,240
tactics include ambush

259
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,360
charge

260
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,760
skirmish siege

261
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,760
encirclement

262
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,720
they describe something that you do

263
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,959
not the objective

264
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,959
but more importantly

265
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,639
they describe how you deploy your forces

266
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,839
let's look at an example

267
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,440
ambush

268
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,560
is a military tactic

269
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,880
it describes reconnaissance to find

270
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,040
suitable terrain

271
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,959
it describes preparation of the

272
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,320
battlefield

273
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,279
traps and obstructions

274
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,839
it describes compositions of teams and

275
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,120
roles

276
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,040
like rifle squads machine gunners

277
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,279
anti-tank teams security teams assault

278
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,440
elements

279
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,680
it describes deployment and positioning

280
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,320
of those teams

281
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,639
it describes actions on objective once

282
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,560
the enemy convoy enters the kill zone

283
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,920
you block off the front you block off

284
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,079
the back you fire until you achieve the

285
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,440
intended effect

286
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,279
and then you fall back

287
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,160
to the rally point

288
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,000
now how does this translate to the cyber

289
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,800
security domain

290
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,360
i don't know

291
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,000
but i see some parallels

292
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,040
terrain and battlefield

293
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,120
correspond to

294
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,800
the attacker infrastructure and the

295
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
infrastructure under attack

296
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,519
in our world

297
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,079
the teams and roles have equivalents as

298
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,319
well

299
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,959
one example

300
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,600
the team tasked with achieving initial

301
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,199
access

302
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,519
if it's in-house with a threat actor we

303
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,399
call that the breach team

304
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,360
if it's outsourced we call it an initial

305
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,079
access broker

306
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
there are other roles as well

307
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,240
malware developers

308
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,320
infrastructure maintainers

309
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,800
social engineers money mules and so

310
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,760
forth and so on

311
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,160
a tactic is not a point event

312
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,120
a chain of events

313
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,800
or a playbook

314
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,199
this playbook is related to the tactical

315
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,959
objectives in mitre attack so we

316
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,319
shouldn't throw those away

317
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,959
we should just stop calling them tactics

318
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,040
maybe we can call them objectives

319
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
we do research on

320
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,399
adversary roles and teams

321
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,320
we do research on

322
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,560
adversary playbooks but we lack a

323
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,279
standard structured way to record and

324
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,000
share this knowledge

325
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,519
which brings me to my first story for

326
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,880
today

327
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,880
with this nice little storytelling

328
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,279
picture

329
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,360
i remember reading an incident report

330
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,839
many years ago but i can't for the life

331
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,920
of me find that report again which

332
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,120
annoys me but that's life

333
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,480
but i think it was about the 2013

334
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,360
lockheed martin bridge

335
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,959
one thing really stood out to me in that

336
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,880
report

337
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,560
the attackers

338
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,920
were described as stealthy

339
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,320
they took great care

340
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,639
to avoid detection and to cover their

341
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,480
tracks

342
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,160
but once they realized

343
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,600
that they had been detected

344
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,959
they switched to a smash and grab tactic

345
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,519
they try to collect and exfiltrate

346
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,320
as much information as they could as

347
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,480
quickly as possible stealth be down

348
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,040
other examples include attackers that

349
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,759
switch to destructive tactics or

350
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,000
scorched earth

351
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,440
if they realize that they have been

352
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,720
detected

353
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,240
or attackers that suddenly drop

354
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,839
ransomware

355
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,120
when they understand that they have been

356
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,440
detected

357
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,120
so first off

358
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,399
to me

359
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,199
these sound a lot like tactics smash and

360
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,719
grab scorched earth

361
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,880
and second

362
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,120
wouldn't this information be useful to

363
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,240
an incident responder

364
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,519
if you know

365
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,160
that the attacker will cause destruction

366
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,519
when they realize that they have been

367
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,600
detected

368
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,920
would that affect your decision making

369
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,199
as an incident responder

370
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,400
because it sure would affect mine

371
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,439
so wouldn't it be useful

372
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,319
to collect and enumerate tactics like

373
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,480
this in some kind of

374
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,199
knowledge base

375
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,679
like in mitre attack

376
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,559
i think so

377
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,720
and i think we should do that

378
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,540
moving on to

379
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,280
[Music]

380
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,760
techniques

381
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,400
attack techniques describe

382
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,440
how

383
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
an adversary achieves something how it's

384
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,480
done

385
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,120
their behavior

386
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,559
techniques are useful for attribution

387
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,520
we can detect techniques

388
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,360
techniques can be used to make these

389
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,678
nice heat maps of detection coverage

390
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,200
actually some of the techniques in

391
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,320
attack describe what an adversary gets

392
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,160
not their behavior

393
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,760
but what they get

394
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,799
like valid accounts

395
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,080
my experience is that techniques are way

396
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
too general to have any usefulness

397
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,160
whatsoever in attribution there's too

398
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,960
much overlap

399
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,120
it doesn't work

400
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,280
and you don't detect the technique

401
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,960
you detect an implementation or a

402
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,799
procedure

403
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,160
in fact you don't even detect the

404
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,679
procedure you detect the traces

405
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,799
that it leaves behind

406
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,440
i mentioned the design and philosophy

407
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,200
paper and about heat maps

408
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,520
this is a quote the techniques within

409
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,679
attack may have many procedures for how

410
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,760
an adversary could implement them and

411
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,880
because

412
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,960
adversaries are always changing it's

413
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,240
difficult to know what all these

414
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,799
procedures are in advance

415
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,640
that makes discussing coverage of a

416
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,080
technique tough

417
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,320
especially when some ways of detecting

418
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,799
behavior rely on individual procedures

419
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,120
and some may span multiple procedures or

420
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,479
even an entire technique

421
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,480
and furthermore

422
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,280
anyone mapping to attack

423
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,440
should be able to explain the procedures

424
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,840
i cover

425
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,760
which brings me to my second show of

426
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,679
hands how many of you have seen

427
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,840
technologies or products that

428
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,199
map to mitra attack

429
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,400
comma

430
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,840
all of you have right

431
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,400
and then the follow-up

432
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,160
how many of you have seen

433
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,000
technologies or products mapping to

434
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,159
attack that explain the procedures they

435
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,480
cover

436
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,159
a couple of you

437
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,280
why is that so

438
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,799
well if you tell someone to do something

439
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,480
but you don't give them the means to do

440
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,440
so

441
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,960
what's going to happen

442
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,679
they're not going to do it

443
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,159
we're probably not going to do it

444
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,080
and i think that's the problem attack

445
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,080
doesn't really provide the means

446
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,639
to map the procedures

447
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,400
so a short story about our use of attack

448
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,320
we made the mistake of trying to use

449
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,559
attack for automation

450
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,120
an automation requires machine readable

451
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,960
information

452
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,360
a description field with human readable

453
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,840
text is the bane of automation not just

454
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,159
because it's difficult for a computer to

455
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,240
interpret

456
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,480
but also because people will stuff all

457
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,559
the important information into that

458
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,760
human

459
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,240
readable description field

460
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,200
because it's easy

461
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,280
instead of figuring out where in this

462
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,200
big complex structure you should put

463
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,960
your information you have this nice

464
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,400
description field you can put everything

465
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,960
in there so but we did automation anyway

466
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,440
so we developed an open source tool

467
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,280
called adversary emulation planner

468
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,159
this tool takes a set of techniques

469
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,559
and gives you a set of ordered attack

470
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,640
stages with all the techniques that are

471
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,440
possible to use at each stage

472
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,760
and to achieve this we

473
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,440
semantically model technique

474
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,159
dependencies

475
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,679
every technique requires something

476
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,200
and it provides something

477
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,039
this is the reason why you're using the

478
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,240
technique

479
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,440
because of what it provides

480
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,520
and what it provides can be required by

481
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,360
another technique and so on

482
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,679
so for every technique and sub technique

483
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,120
in attack

484
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,600
we describe what it requires

485
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,360
and what it provides

486
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,520
and that made it easy to build a tool

487
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,559
that generates the attack stages

488
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,720
this works when

489
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,600
techniques describe how an adversary

490
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,720
achieves something their behavior

491
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,480
but it breaks down when techniques

492
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,159
describe what an adversary achieves or

493
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,720
what the technique provides

494
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,880
it doesn't fit so we basically had to

495
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,039
ignore those techniques

496
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,640
so if you come to attack with an

497
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,799
automation first

498
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,440
mindset

499
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,360
chances are that you will be

500
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,679
disappointed

501
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,000
design decisions that work for manual

502
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,320
processes

503
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,000
do not work well for automation

504
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,440
then over to the final part on my

505
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,760
completely illegible slide

506
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,840
sorry about that

507
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,399
procedures

508
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,280
attack describes the procedures used by

509
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,880
adversaries

510
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,240
so the thing on the right that you

511
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,919
probably can't read

512
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,280
that's from one of the techniques in

513
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,760
attack and it's a long list of procedure

514
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,840
examples

515
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,720
connected to threat actors or

516
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,200
software

517
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,960
have a look at the right hand side here

518
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,240
this is the attack object model

519
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,679
do you see procedures there

520
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,799
no

521
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,120
what you saw in the previous slide

522
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,159
was

523
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,799
procedure examples

524
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,120
human readable description fields

525
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,120
and most of them are of the form

526
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,640
adversary x uses software y

527
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,039
to achieve this

528
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,360
procedures are useful for attribution

529
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,760
in my experience you can observe two

530
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,600
different adversaries

531
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,679
using the same technique but their

532
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,679
procedures are different

533
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,840
by looking at the details

534
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,559
like command line parameters you're able

535
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,440
to distinguish them

536
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,039
you can't detect procedures either but

537
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,120
they contain a lot more detail than

538
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,960
techniques and those details are helpful

539
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,400
when you develop detection analytics

540
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,600
so why are we not enumerating procedures

541
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,480
why do techniques have ids

542
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,840
but procedures don't

543
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,039
and this time the story is about you

544
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,400
you handle an incident

545
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,720
during this incident you observe a third

546
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,919
actor using mimikats for os credential

547
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,320
dumping

548
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,000
you see that this information is

549
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,240
actually not in microattack

550
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,320
and since you are an upstanding citizen

551
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,919
you want to report istimiter for

552
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,679
inclusion in attack to help others

553
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,000
you now have two choices you can either

554
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,320
report that the adversary group uses os

555
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,919
credential dumping

556
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,360
or

557
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,200
you can report that the adversary group

558
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,039
uses mimikats

559
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,840
but not both

560
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,919
the problem with the second approach

561
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,679
is that this links the adversary group

562
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,760
to mimikatz but not to always credential

563
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,158
dumping

564
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,360
mimikats implements nine different

565
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,640
techniques

566
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,440
in mitre attack

567
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,320
so your observation was the use

568
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,159
of a single technique but someone else

569
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,480
looking this up in attack have no way of

570
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,679
telling

571
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,240
whether the adversary used mimikatz for

572
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,840
one technique

573
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,799
or for nine techniques

574
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,720
this is information loss and information

575
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,840
loss is

576
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,960
bad why are there two different ways to

577
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,320
report techniques or technique usage

578
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,480
in attack

579
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,039
well i can give my opinion because

580
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,679
procedures are not part of the object

581
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,840
model

582
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,799
this has been a huge headache for us

583
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,240
working on threat intelligence

584
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,640
automation

585
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
in my opinion the correct way to record

586
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,320
this information is as follows

587
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,440
the adversary group used mimikats

588
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,679
to execute a procedure

589
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,720
this procedure implements os credential

590
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,960
dumping the technique

591
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,960
the adversary group and the software are

592
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,120
linked to the procedure and not to the

593
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,120
technique

594
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,919
here's a picture of the road ahead

595
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,600
it's long

596
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,919
we can't see the end of it but it seems

597
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,360
to have a pretty clear direction

598
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,520
now

599
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,080
the road ahead also known as my personal

600
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,279
wishlist

601
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,880
i think that's maybe a more accurate

602
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,240
description this is what i would do

603
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,679
first off

604
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,840
i would remove all of these what you get

605
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,679
techniques from attack

606
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,320
they actually hurt automation

607
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,799
if you cannot describe

608
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,720
the behavior

609
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,440
what the how an adversary does something

610
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,760
then it shouldn't be called a technique

611
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,640
it's something else

612
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,760
and the second thing is

613
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,760
we should enumerate procedures and we

614
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,039
should try to figure out how

615
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,720
to represent them in a machine-readable

616
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,760
way

617
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,760
and the same goes for tactics we should

618
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,679
start enumerating them

619
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,600
and we should stop calling the tactical

620
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
objectives tactics

621
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,120
because

622
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,880
that makes us think that we understand

623
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,600
what tactics are

624
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,719
and even further ahead

625
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,200
if we are able to describe procedures in

626
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,360
a machine-readable way we should start

627
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,360
looking at ways to transform

628
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,640
this into detection analytics

629
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,320
and the closest i've seen there for a

630
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,159
domain specific language is stick's

631
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,279
patterning

632
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,720
which could be a target for such a

633
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,279
transformation

634
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,080
now in the introduction

635
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,320
i showed a quote from socrates the greek

636
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,600
philosopher

637
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,760
the master of annoying people

638
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,720
if you add a c to that you get socrates

639
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,960
the innovation project

640
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,720
a lot of the ideas presented here

641
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,600
originated from or

642
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,679
matured in the socrates project

643
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,240
socrates develops a

644
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,480
security automation and decision support

645
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,000
platform for security operation centers

646
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,080
and incident response team so if you're

647
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,320
interested

648
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,159
in research on automation

649
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,679
have a look at the webpage there's a lot

650
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,000
of information there

651
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,799
but to wrap up

652
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,159
if you remember only one thing from this

653
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,919
presentation

654
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,679
then you need to step up and do better

655
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,200
because i needed to remember three

656
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,440
things

657
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,760
we don't know what tactics are

658
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,960
we don't know what procedures are

659
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,159
and we need to do something about that

660
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,660
thank you

661
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:52,919
[Applause]

662
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,240
thank you very thank you very much dr

663
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,200
martin

664
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,440
now it's time for question

665
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,679
so again there are two microphones i can

666
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,919
see up front so if you have any

667
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,600
questions

668
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,918
just show up in front of microphone yeah

669
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
my question is what

670
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,240
maitre thinks about your personal wish

671
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
list

672
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,279
they mostly ignored me so far

673
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,120
i think three or four years ago i tried

674
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,960
pushing uh pushing them to get

675
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,960
procedures included in attack but the

676
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,880
answer was people are already

677
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,360
complaining about how the complexity and

678
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,840
all of too much information so they

679
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,039
didn't want to go there but then two

680
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,559
years later they implemented some

681
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,600
techniques

682
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,279
so i don't know

683
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,159
i'll keep complaining

684
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,159
and if someone feels personally offended

685
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,600
then

686
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,600
good i think

687
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,640
i mean

688
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,799
someone has to ask questions

689
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,480
and i might be wrong these are my

690
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,559
personal opinions i'm happy to be proven

691
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,480
wrong

692
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,120
thank you for the good talks thank you

693
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,320
i'm in the cyber threat intelligence

694
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,600
i would like to know how can we

695
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,640
enable tactics and procedures

696
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,399
where we don't know about them

697
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,159
yeah we first need to agree on what they

698
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,559
are and as i said the closest i've come

699
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,559
is to me like things like smash and grab

700
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,799
sounds a lot like a tactic to me

701
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,559
it sounds similar to what tactics are in

702
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,000
the military domain

703
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,240
how to enable them

704
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,799
well you start identifying them you read

705
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,799
reports you see descriptions of

706
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,360
adversary tactics there

707
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,120
so i don't know if low and slow is a

708
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,679
tactic i don't know if yeah

709
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,159
does it mean that we can reflect it into

710
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,120
some numbering or some skills oh yeah to

711
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,200
what enumerate means it means assigning

712
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,600
an identifier like in my tree for every

713
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,159
technique you have a t and a number an

714
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,159
id

715
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,640
that's what i mean by enumeration okay

716
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,399
and ideally this would be part of attack

717
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,519
itself

718
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,559

719
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,640
