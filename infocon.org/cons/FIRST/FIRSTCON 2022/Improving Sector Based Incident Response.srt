00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,480
i'm leonel ferret working for the

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,240
belgian national search and i'm your

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,360
session chair for this morning

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,240
so

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,960
the usual rules apply please turn your

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,160
phones and other noisy devices off or at

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,000
least silence them

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,260
please remember to

9
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,519
[Music]

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,679
fill in the surveys

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,519
the presentation surveys

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,120
after presentation and there will be

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,399
five minutes

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,480
for questions after justin's

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,760
presentation

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,040
so justine is a researcher at carnegie

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,760
mellon and cc

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,000
and he will tell us about

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,559
improving sector-based incident response

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,920
so let's give him a warm welcome

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,239
thank you

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,800
thank you lionel for the introduction um

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,039
as he said my name is justin novak i'm

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,960
with the software engineering institute

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,040
uh with the cirque coordination center

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,799
and i'm going to be talking about sector

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,119
c certs today specifically i'm going to

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,840
be talking about a new document a new

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,920
guide that we've published recently

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,720
called the sector c search framework

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,960
and we hope this guide is a tool

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,720
that teams can use to help them develop

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,400
new sector c cert

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,080
and sector-based incident response

35
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,000
capabilities

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,040
so

37
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,240
just a quick preview uh we'll talk first

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,520
at the beginning

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,759
about defining sectors and defining a

40
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,520
sector c cert right we have to know what

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,200
we're talking about before we can really

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,360
understand the challenges

43
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,360
but then we'll talk a little bit about

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,840
building c-certs and why some of the

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,000
existing approaches don't necessarily

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,720
work really well for sector c-serves

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,399
and that's what led us to our new

48
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,920
approach

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,360
which is this framework that we've

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,720
developed and we hope to share with

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,920
everyone

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,280
and this new approach is centered on

53
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,360
what we call a national cybersecurity

54
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,040
ecosystem so we'll talk about what that

55
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,840
is

56
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,439
and why it's important when you're

57
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,079
developing a sector cser

58
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,600
and finally we'll we'll talk a little

59
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,758
bit about the framework itself uh what's

60
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,080
in it what isn't in it um and how

61
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,599
hopefully you can use it uh when

62
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,720
developing these sector-based

63
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,120
capabilities right

64
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,640
before we do that though a little bit of

65
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,360
context um just about myself and our

66
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,480
team

67
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,239
and this is important for understanding

68
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,319
how we arrived at this problem

69
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,920
and the solution

70
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,160
so the security operations team at the

71
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,760
sei has a mission of developing c cert

72
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,319
capabilities and building capacity for

73
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,160
existing csers

74
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,519
so we've been doing this a little more

75
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,280
than seven years

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,360
building all kinds of c-cert teams with

77
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,800
partners around the world national

78
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,080
c-certs

79
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,760
sector c-certs

80
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,200
other types of incident response

81
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,120
organizations socks

82
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,280
and so on and so forth

83
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,319
so

84
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,120
and and before that really the sei has

85
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,480
been doing the same mission for even

86
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,040
longer for decades really so what we

87
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,599
have is a lot of experience and a lot of

88
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,680
lessons learned in the area of

89
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,239
developing c-cert teams including sector

90
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,519
c-certs

91
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,599
so that's just a little bit of context

92
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,920
about where we're coming from

93
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,720
and how we arrived at this problem

94
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
so starting at the beginning when we're

95
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,959
talking about sector c certs obviously

96
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,000
we want to understand uh why sectors are

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,159
important what makes sectors so unique

98
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,440
that they need these specialized

99
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,959
organizations called sector sea certs

100
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,959
so this is uh this is just one

101
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,599
definition of a critical infrastructure

102
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,440
sector this comes from cisa in the

103
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,200
united states

104
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,959
and they say that a critical sector of

105
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,519
an economy is defined as

106
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,640
infrastructure whose assets systems etc

107
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,599
are so vital that their incapacitation

108
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,519
would have a debilitating effect on

109
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,920
security economic security et cetera et

110
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,080
cetera et cetera right so the key word

111
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,640
in this definition is critical

112
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,040
which is interesting because that raises

113
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,480
the question what about sectors that

114
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,920
aren't critical right

115
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,680
um so

116
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,599
this is again just one definition it's a

117
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,280
good definition

118
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,760
but it's certainly not the only one

119
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,439
our definition is a little bit more

120
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,519
broad because when we were developing

121
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,680
this tool we wanted it to be broadly

122
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,680
applicable to all

123
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,519
sector seizures to all sectors not just

124
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,800
critical ones

125
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,400
but all of them

126
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,840
so there's a couple different challenges

127
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,759
when you have a broad definition like

128
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,880
that

129
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,639
for one you're talking about

130
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,199
organizations with a range of capability

131
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,759
levels highly mature organizations and

132
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,440
new organizations

133
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
you're talking about systems that might

134
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,320
not necessarily all be the same you may

135
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,199
have a sector maybe the energy sector

136
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,479
where you have a lot of legacy

137
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,560
industrial control systems

138
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,040
mixed with new smart technologies

139
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,919
connected grids things like that

140
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,680
so you have this sort of fragmented

141
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,120
landscape when you're talking about a

142
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,720
sector

143
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,960
and it can be really challenging

144
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,160
but

145
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,000
like i said when we develop this tool we

146
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
want it to be broadly applicable so

147
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,919
we've taken a definition of a sector

148
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,479
that is very broad and we say that a

149
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,080
sector is just any group of stakeholders

150
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,320
who are part of the same sector of an

151
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,400
economy and are interested in incident

152
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,759
response

153
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,080
so we take that broad definition of a

154
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,120
sector

155
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,479
so as instant responders we have to ask

156
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,560
what is what are the unique challenges

157
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,639
in defending the sector and in

158
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,120
responding to incidents

159
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,840
well it turns out that the answer is is

160
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,800
in the term right the sector is a

161
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
challenge because of sector-specific

162
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,840
threats so if we think about

163
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,320
the financial sector you have threats

164
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,759
you have malwa that's designed

165
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,919
specifically to attack financial systems

166
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,880
credit card processing systems et cetera

167
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,919
different sectors have different threats

168
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,360
and they have different needs when it

169
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,600
comes to incident response

170
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,840
and this is a result of specialization

171
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,759
of the economy and then specialization

172
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,919
of the attacker right when an attacker

173
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,759
develops

174
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,639
an

175
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,600
attack vector that is specific to one

176
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,720
sector we as responders have to have

177
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,520
equally specialized response so that

178
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,840
leads us to this thing called a sector c

179
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,039
cert

180
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,639
again we take a broad

181
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,960
view of it here we take a very broad

182
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,600
definition for our framework because we

183
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,680
want it to be broadly applicable but we

184
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,400
say a sector ceaser is anybody that is

185
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,080
responsible for incident response and

186
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,479
management in a subset of a country or

187
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,400
an economy

188
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,800
so you'll notice that in this definition

189
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,280
the only thing that we really say you

190
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,479
must do in order to be a sector c cert

191
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,800
is incident response now of course

192
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,319
that's not a comprehensive list of what

193
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,319
a sector c-server is going to do or any

194
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,000
c-cert really

195
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,199
there are a lot of other things you can

196
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:55,919
do

197
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,000
communication and coordination

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,240
disseminating information

199
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,560
providing training capacity building

200
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,919
awareness

201
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,400
um serving as a c sort of last resort

202
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,000
for other cserts

203
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,120
there are a lot of different things that

204
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,199
sector c cert may do

205
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,800
but in order to qualify under our

206
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,120
definition the only thing you have to do

207
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,840
is instant response

208
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,240
so this is what we think a sector sea

209
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,120
cert is so now the question is

210
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,520
why are these things called sector sea

211
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,199
certs so beneficial why do we want to

212
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,360
develop them and implement them in our

213
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,840
country or economy uh or whatever the

214
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,520
case may be

215
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,720
i talked a little bit about the

216
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,280
expertise right the specialization of

217
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,520
the incident response capability to meet

218
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,039
the specialization of the threat that

219
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,160
exists

220
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,400
uh but there are other advantages

221
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,160
one of the main advantages

222
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,960
is

223
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,560
the enabling of

224
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,599
shared risk or or shared risk avoidance

225
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,039
right

226
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,479
so if you have a sector in your country

227
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,240
let's say it's the energy sector and you

228
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,039
have several major companies several big

229
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,039
stakeholders and they're not working

230
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,160
together

231
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
then they're all facing the same threat

232
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,000
surface right they're all facing the

233
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,080
same number of threats there's a fixed

234
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,680
number of threats out there it may

235
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,000
change from day to day but at any given

236
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,840
point in time there are only so many

237
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,759
threats out there

238
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,120
and if everyone in the sector is working

239
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,879
separately then they all have to deal

240
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,039
with the same number of threats it's the

241
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,360
same quantity of of risk that you're

242
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,000
facing but if we work together we can

243
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,479
share that risk and spread it out

244
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,360
and

245
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,000
then we're only facing maybe a fraction

246
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,679
of the total risk that we would have

247
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,200
otherwise had

248
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,880
and a sector c cert is something that

249
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,080
can able can enable this type of sharing

250
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,240
this risk and threat sharing

251
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,360
so this is really one of the great

252
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,000
benefits of a sector c cert so we know

253
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,080
they're important we know what they are

254
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,480
and we know we want to implement them

255
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,560
before we talk about how to do that

256
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,720
just a real quick note on terminology

257
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,040
i'm using the term sector c cert here

258
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,240
because that's what we use in the

259
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,360
framework in the actual document

260
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,160
but

261
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,240
you'll see other terms out there in

262
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,279
other resources in other places sectoral

263
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,480
c-certs

264
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,399
sector-based cyber centers uh isacs uh

265
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,000
nysec is

266
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,519
some would argue is somewhat different

267
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,519
than a sector c-cert

268
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,120
but we still consider all of these

269
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,680
things to be sector-based incident

270
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,240
response capabilities even if it has a

271
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
more narrow mission like an isac it's

272
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,480
still an incident response capability

273
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,320
because they have some role to play in

274
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,880
that incident response mission

275
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,080
so i'm using the term sector c cert here

276
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,800
just uh note that we feel this this tool

277
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,160
that we've developed is broadly

278
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,040
applicable to all of these capabilities

279
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,480
if you're developing one of those

280
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,680
so the question is

281
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,600
why or the question is how do we build

282
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,959
these capabilities we know why they're

283
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,480
important we know what they can do for

284
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,279
us

285
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,000
in terms of reducing the risk

286
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,640
sharing the threats

287
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,720
and developing that specialization or

288
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,240
that expertise

289
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,480
so how do we do them it turns out we

290
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,959
know a lot about developing c-certs

291
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,279
but it also turns out we don't know a

292
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,279
lot about developing sector sea certs

293
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,360
specifically right

294
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,360
like i said our team's been doing this

295
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,440
for seven years the sei for for much

296
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,560
longer

297
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,399
we have a lot of documentation and a lot

298
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,760
of resources

299
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,240
the sei handbook for c-serts was first

300
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,640
published more than 20 years ago

301
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,120
and it's still a very relevant very

302
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,880
important resource for teams that are

303
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,640
developing c-certs

304
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,959
there's the first c-series handbook

305
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,519
there are other resources out there

306
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,200
and there are some specific specialized

307
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,480
resources

308
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,800
once for industry one's for pcerts

309
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,240
etc

310
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,200
but

311
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,160
there is no or at least there was no in

312
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,480
2019 when we started this project

313
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,800
there was no resource that really told

314
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,600
you

315
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,320
how to develop a sector c cert and

316
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,560
address the specific uh challenges that

317
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,880
are associated with that task

318
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,000
so that's what we set out to correct

319
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,920
so let's go back to the beginning of

320
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,160
developing a c-serve or i'm sorry

321
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,399
developing a sector c-server

322
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,920
as i said we've learned a lot of lessons

323
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,720
over the years um in actually doing this

324
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,279
and the key thing that we learned was

325
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,440
that a sector c cert kind of sits in the

326
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,399
middle

327
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,040
right so here

328
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,800
these are sector c search right in the

329
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,880
middle of this big diagram and there's a

330
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,560
lot of there's a lot going on here it's

331
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,480
it's intentionally busy

332
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,640
there are a lot of organizations

333
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,720
um there are a lot of different levels

334
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
and there are a lot of interactions

335
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,040
so we have sort of a regional level at

336
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,279
the top and then a national level

337
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,560
and then you have the sector level and

338
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,040
then beneath that you have individual

339
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,279
organizations

340
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,959
private sector organizations

341
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,480
corporations

342
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,560
et cetera et cetera

343
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,639
and the unique thing about a sector c

344
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,560
cert is that it really interacts with

345
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,120
all of these things right on

346
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,360
looking up you have c certs have a lot

347
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,800
of interaction with maybe a national

348
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,480
c-cert or a regional body maybe other

349
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,880
government agencies a financial sector

350
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,120
cser may for example work with a

351
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,120
treasury department or something like

352
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,320
that

353
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,880
and then they work laterally often

354
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,200
communicating with other sector c-certs

355
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,560
um maybe because they're sharing

356
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,040
information uh or they're doing training

357
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,200
together or something like that

358
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,120
and then of course working down they're

359
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,040
working with their constituency

360
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,720
so this is a really unique position that

361
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,680
the sector c-cert

362
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,399
it's a unique position that it has um

363
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,639
within this this group and in all these

364
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,320
interactions

365
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,279
so

366
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,360
think about if we don't have a sector

367
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,800
sister you still have all these other

368
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,720
things you have all these organizations

369
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,800
all these stakeholders

370
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,279
so if if i have all these interactions

371
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,519
and all these organizations sitting here

372
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,880
and they're working together maybe

373
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,560
they're sharing information

374
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,880
cooperating on incident response and

375
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,399
then i go over here and i say okay i'm

376
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,680
going to build a sector c cert because

377
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,800
it's going to help

378
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,040
and then i take that sector c cert and i

379
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,279
drop it right here in the middle

380
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,320
right in the middle what's going to

381
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,000
happen

382
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,680
disruption

383
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,320
disruption is what's going to happen and

384
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,160
related to disruption you're going to

385
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,399
have challenges with implementing that

386
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,399
sector cesar capability

387
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,680
because all the people who have been

388
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,839
disrupted by this all the organizations

389
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,440
who have been disrupted

390
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,399
there you know there's going to be

391
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,600
ruffled feathers there's going to be

392
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,959
people upset

393
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,320
you may have

394
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,399
for example maybe a national sea cert

395
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,240
was fulfilling a certain mission

396
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,000
and if that mission is taken away and

397
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,240
given to a sector ceaser you may have

398
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,040
some

399
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,519
loss of prestige loss of funding things

400
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,880
like that

401
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,199
and on the lower level if you have an

402
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,560
industry

403
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,160
who is used to operating in a certain

404
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,320
way and you suddenly put a sector c cert

405
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,480
in now they may have new reporting

406
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,959
requirements or something like that

407
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,199
that may again ruffle some feathers or

408
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,199
cause some disruption right so two

409
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,040
challenges disruption

410
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,880
and then challenges in implementing this

411
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,079
capability

412
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,720
as a result of that disruption

413
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,839
so

414
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,160
these are in our experience have been

415
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,560
the primary challenges and the primary

416
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,839
barriers to implementing sector c certs

417
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,360
so those are the challenges we set about

418
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,800
to solve when we were developing this

419
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,160
framework

420
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,120
so

421
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,959
we thought about this and we kind of

422
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,480
went back to the beginning

423
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,680
and said

424
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
we need to look at this

425
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
group of stakeholders and all these

426
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,079
interactions and place them at the

427
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,839
center of what we're doing and we called

428
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,920
this group the national cyber security

429
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,199
ecosystem

430
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,079
so simple definition it's just the group

431
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,399
of stakeholders

432
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,800
that make up that sector

433
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,959
and this can be constituents it can be

434
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,279
government agencies law enforcement

435
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,519
really anyone who has any stake

436
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,920
in incident response or cyber security

437
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,079
for that particular sector

438
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,519
so that's the national cyber security

439
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,160
ecosystem

440
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,040
how do we understand the the

441
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,199
national cyber security ecosystem and

442
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,279
some of the more granular more specific

443
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,800
challenges that we'll see when dealing

444
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,920
with it when we want to build

445
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,680
sector cser

446
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,519
well we need to consider each of these

447
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,199
teams

448
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,519
and what their needs are right what do

449
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,760
they need what can they get out of this

450
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,279
what can they bring to the table when

451
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,440
we're developing sector c-cert so we

452
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,040
need to think of think about things like

453
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,800
establishing trust

454
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,199
right how do we get

455
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,199
organizations to share information with

456
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,600
a sector ceaser or with each other

457
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,519
how does it work right now in that

458
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,680
national cyber security ecosystem and

459
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,160
how that changed when i put in a sector

460
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,079
c cert

461
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,000
who's responsible for what what is the

462
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,160
role of the national sea cert this is

463
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,199
connected to roles and responsibilities

464
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,440
so is the national sea cert currently in

465
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,360
charge of communications and information

466
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,040
sharing how will that change when i

467
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,720
develop a sector sea cert what kind of

468
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,639
disruption is that going to cause

469
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,480
all these different considerations

470
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,480
that are important for understanding

471
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,880
that national cyber security ecosystem

472
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,120
and the role that it plays

473
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,680
so we thought of some questions that we

474
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,680
wanted to ask when we're developing this

475
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,279
sector c cert

476
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,680
so these are again connected to those

477
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,120
those types of information that we want

478
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,199
to understand but we want to ask what is

479
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,800
the role of the national sea cert what

480
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,320
are they doing what services do they

481
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,199
provide what services don't they provide

482
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,639
we want to ask about the relationship

483
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,480
between the sector c-cert and the

484
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,160
national c-cert

485
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,120
is it going to be a relationship where

486
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,440
the sector ceaser reports to or is

487
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,160
subordinate to the national c-cert

488
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,800
or are they going to be equals are they

489
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,639
simply going to have no relationship

490
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,000
these are all considerations that you

491
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,920
have to take in into account when you're

492
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,000
developing your capability

493
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,600
what if there's no national c-cert at

494
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,399
all we've seen a couple cases where

495
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,079
countries have gone forward with

496
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,480
developing sector sea certs before they

497
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,640
develop a national c-cert or maybe a

498
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,520
sector c-cert exists and it's a private

499
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,000
association maybe an association of

500
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
bankers has put together an incident

501
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,240
response capability before that country

502
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,280
was able to stand up a national sea cert

503
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,880
or a national cyber center or something

504
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,720
like that so you have to ask all these

505
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,559
questions and think about it

506
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,079
when you're developing that sector c

507
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,400
cert and think about what do we have

508
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,480
currently in

509
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,640
the national cyber security ecosystem

510
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,360
and how are we going to change things

511
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,919
so that led us to the sector's research

512
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,160
framework right so the framework is a

513
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,880
guide and it's designed as a tool for

514
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,120
helping any parties any interested

515
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,760
parties who are wanting to develop a

516
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,440
sector c cert

517
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,679
and we have two goals with this document

518
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,120
and they're to solve those those two

519
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,440
challenges that i mentioned first to

520
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,520
help teams develop these sector-based uh

521
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,640
c surge or sector-based capabilities

522
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,640
and second to integrate those

523
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,640
capabilities into the national cyber

524
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,400
security ecosystem

525
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,480
right so our challenges were disruption

526
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,559
of the ecosystem and then implementation

527
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,320
so we want to solve those challenges by

528
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,240
developing effective teams and

529
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
integrating them effectively into the

530
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,200
national cyber security ecosystem

531
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,360
so six parts in the framework

532
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,200
um first

533
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,360
well before i go through the parts

534
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,840
what's important to emphasize is that at

535
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,760
every step of this process

536
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,440
we put that national cybersecurity

537
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,760
ecosystem kind of at the forefront right

538
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,600
so we think about it when we're going

539
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,520
through each of these steps so step one

540
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,600
is satisfying the prerequisites

541
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,520
this is thinking about things like where

542
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,440
am i going to get funding

543
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,480
who's going to staff this organization

544
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,400
this is what services will my sector

545
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,840
ceaser provide

546
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,080
um what what services won't it provide

547
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,640
who is the constituency so when we're

548
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,559
thinking about those things let's take

549
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,480
the example of what services i'm going

550
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,080
to provide

551
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,520
you can't just go in and say i'm going

552
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,520
to create a sector c cert and it's going

553
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,799
to provide

554
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,000
awareness

555
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,320
training and communications and

556
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,720
information sharing because there may be

557
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,400
someone already in that ecosystem doing

558
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,880
that right you can't just go and go

559
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,480
ahead and say this sector c search is

560
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,799
going to provide digital forensics

561
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,799
assistance maybe law enforcement is

562
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,480
already doing that so you have to

563
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,400
consider all these stakeholders when

564
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,520
you're when you're going through those

565
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,679
prerequisites right

566
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,919
what about gathering information this is

567
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,760
the process of going out to those that

568
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760
group of stakeholders and actually

569
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,600
asking them

570
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,400
what

571
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,160
is it that you want from this sector c

572
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,919
cert and what do you think you can

573
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,480
provide that sector c cert so this is

574
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,799
going on and engaging with stakeholders

575
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,559
um and sort of getting their take on

576
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,720
things so that you can start to

577
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,559
understand the challenges and how you

578
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,120
can solve those challenges

579
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,720
step three is organizing that

580
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,960
information and evaluating gaps

581
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,720
understanding what's missing

582
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,360
right what is not being done by it by

583
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,280
this community in this ecosystem right

584
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,080
now

585
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,520
and how can we close those gaps

586
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,440
then step four you build a roadmap right

587
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,360
this is how we get from a to b from

588
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,159
where we are our as is state

589
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,120
um over to our 2b state

590
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,840
so

591
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,840
this is where you start to get into

592
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,159
ruffling some of those feathers right

593
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,840
we're going to change things maybe we

594
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,000
need to pass a law maybe there needs to

595
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,480
be new policies new moas things like

596
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,360
that

597
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,520
so this is where we start to to do that

598
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,280
that disruption thing

599
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
and we want to be really careful about

600
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,520
taking into account the needs of the

601
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,640
ecosystem and all the stakeholders

602
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,960
planning and implementing of course

603
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,720
very challenging this is where we see a

604
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,280
lot of efforts sort of go sideways or

605
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,600
run into a little bit of trouble um

606
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,880
because this is where things actually

607
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,919
start to change right now we're actually

608
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,679
we actually have a facility we're

609
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,799
putting people there and they're

610
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,159
actually starting to execute their

611
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,120
mission

612
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,480
and now we have new reporting

613
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,400
requirements we have new other

614
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,200
requirements et cetera et cetera

615
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,360
so we really have to be careful here

616
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,360
and understand how things are changing

617
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,679
for everyone else right

618
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,280
and then finally post implementation

619
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,919
activities this is about understanding

620
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,919
what went wrong and what went right in

621
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,919
your process and then preparing for

622
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,840
another round of development or another

623
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,840
round of implementation and of course

624
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,440
here it's very important to engage with

625
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,120
the ecosystem and with all those

626
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,000
stakeholders so you can ask them

627
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,360
you know how did this work for you was

628
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,080
this successful is this benefiting you

629
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,240
um is this not benefiting you and what

630
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,600
can we do better maybe in the future

631
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,159
so again

632
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,840
six steps and we're putting that

633
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,240
national cyber security ecosystem at the

634
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,440
center of things as as we go throughout

635
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,559
so

636
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,480
each of these core tasks has a

637
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,480
corresponding set of considerations for

638
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,880
the national cyber security ecosystem

639
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,320
i'm not going to go through these kind

640
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
of talked about them already

641
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,960
but they're in the document

642
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,720
and we just emphasize that you have to

643
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,760
keep that in mind throughout the process

644
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,480
so

645
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,080
this is an example

646
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,720
of kind of going through the process

647
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,640
so this is looking at

648
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,600
um

649
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,679
step one which is the prerequisites

650
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,760
right so these are some of the

651
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,039
prerequisites it's not all the

652
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,039
prerequisites but just a couple of

653
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,919
examples so if we look at let's look at

654
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,559
this one here

655
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,880
um so this is determining the services

656
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,200
which i already mentioned a little bit

657
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,440
so at the beginning of the process

658
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,799
right when we're doing all these

659
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,200
prerequisites in this preliminary work

660
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,840
what we want to do is evaluate

661
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,520
and determine the services that are

662
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,360
already being provided

663
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,440
by other members of the national or of

664
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,520
the national ecosystem

665
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,360
and then discuss

666
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,000
what services it might be beneficial for

667
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,320
the sector cesar to offer is it going to

668
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,919
be services that are already provided

669
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,520
elsewhere and those those are just going

670
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,840
to move is it going to be duplicate

671
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,440
services or is it going to be new

672
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,480
services

673
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,600
these are all the questions that we need

674
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,919
to be asking as we go into information

675
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,039
gathering

676
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,559
as you go into information gathering and

677
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,280
then start to develop that roadmap what

678
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,360
you want to do is outline roles and

679
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,240
responsibilities outline new policies

680
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,880
that clarify who's going to be doing

681
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,200
what right

682
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,559
only then do you want to start

683
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,400
implementing and as you start

684
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,159
implementing this is when you do things

685
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,919
like training

686
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,760
and getting teams up to speed

687
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,440
and getting them actually offer these

688
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,840
services and have that capability built

689
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,000
in

690
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,360
last thing just talking about

691
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,880
implementation

692
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,880
if you remember the earlier slide we had

693
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,279
those kind of original questions that we

694
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,080
wanted to ask when we were

695
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,520
understanding that national cyber

696
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,440
security ecosystem you know what role

697
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,679
will the national sea cert play

698
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,080
what if there is no national sea cert

699
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,640
so now that we're doing implementation

700
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,520
we want to rephrase those questions

701
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,120
and we want to ask how things have

702
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,159
changed

703
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,720
right or how things are changing so at

704
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,400
the beginning we asked what role will

705
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
the national sea cert play

706
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,840
in that sector

707
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,480
now we want to ask now that we've

708
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,919
implemented this or now that we are

709
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,520
implementing this

710
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,360
have those roles and responsibilities

711
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,400
changed

712
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,320
is the mission of the national cesar

713
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,240
different now

714
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,840
what about the relationship between the

715
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,559
sector cesar and the national cesar

716
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,159
we asked about that relationship when we

717
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,240
were first considering this but now that

718
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,000
we're implementing you have to think

719
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,159
about has this relationship changed

720
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,840
what's the new relationship between the

721
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,240
national c-cert and the sector

722
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,679
what's the new relationship between the

723
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,480
national sea cert and some of the actual

724
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,600
um

725
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,279
the actual constituents that are in the

726
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,360
sector right they may have had a direct

727
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,200
line to the national seizure before

728
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,279
maybe they don't anymore maybe they go

729
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,520
to a national or to the sector c surge

730
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,880
instead how does this change anything

731
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,760
right

732
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,679
and then how does the sector see sort of

733
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,840
address issues um

734
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,520
related to working

735
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,440
public and private

736
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,200
again when these implementation

737
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,279
activities um

738
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,279
are are done you're having a lot of

739
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,559
disruption right we talked about

740
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,240
disruption and implementation and how

741
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,000
they're related

742
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,360
we have to think about who's being

743
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,600
disrupted what's been changed

744
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,279
and how we can make sure that we're

745
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,120
doing it in a positive way and

746
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,600
leveraging all the capabilities

747
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
rather than a negative way that sort of

748
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,840
leaves some of the capabilities left to

749
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,600
the side

750
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,720
so

751
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,559
the last thing here i just wanted to

752
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,159
share are a couple of use cases that we

753
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,400
have for these sector c certs and for

754
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,240
the framework itself

755
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,960
so these use cases just describe a

756
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,880
couple of different models

757
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,919
for implementing a sector c cert

758
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,840
this is a model that has a national

759
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,159
c-cert as a lead

760
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,240
so we have reporting that's going to a

761
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,679
national sea cert

762
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,760
and then that national sea cert will

763
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,200
kind of triage and determine what sector

764
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,799
it's going to communicate with and it's

765
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,960
going to say okay this this report is

766
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,880
related to the banking sector or the

767
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,720
energy sector or the transportation

768
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,760
sector

769
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,159
and then it's going to filter that

770
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,400
down to the sector c cert and they'll

771
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,120
say

772
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
yes this is something that we can deal

773
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,520
with and they're going to start to work

774
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,120
with their constituent organizations

775
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
down here at the bottom

776
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,480
or they're going to say no this isn't

777
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,679
something that we feel we should do

778
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,279
we're going to kick it back up to the

779
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,279
national ceaser so this is just a

780
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,159
potential model where you might apply on

781
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,960
this exercise framework

782
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,000
another use case this is more led at the

783
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,320
at the lower levels so this would be led

784
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,039
by the sector cert and its constituents

785
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,640
so reporting might go directly either to

786
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,320
the member of the sector or to the

787
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,159
sector ceaser itself

788
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,919
and then they're going to triage it

789
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,440
individually and then they're going to

790
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,360
communicate here

791
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,960
in the middle

792
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,919
and say

793
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,600
how do we want to handle this is this

794
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,679
something that we need to escalate to

795
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,840
the national sea cert is it something

796
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,919
that the sector see cert will handle or

797
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,200
is it something that should just be

798
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,919
handled by the individual organization

799
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,520
so a couple different models here a

800
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,520
couple different use cases

801
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,559
just for consideration of how

802
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,480
each approach is different

803
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,880
and how that ecosystem how those members

804
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,279
of that ecosystem work together

805
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,799
based on whatever model you choose

806
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,720
and however you take this or whatever

807
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,960
approach you take for this

808
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,840
so

809
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,240
i just want to conclude by um giving a

810
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,399
shout out to the rest of my team here i

811
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,399
did not develop this on my own

812
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,240
um we had a lot of hard work put in by

813
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,760
the other members of the security ops

814
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,120
team

815
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,600
so thank you to all these people

816
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,360
and there's our contact information if

817
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,720
you want to contact our team if you have

818
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,640
any questions about this

819
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,799
or other issues and then of course a

820
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,760
link to the framework itself

821
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,279
so

822
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,799
with that

823
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,679
take any questions

824
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,720
hi um thank you for the presentation

825
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,159
when you uh created this did you uh look

826
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,240
at uh what

827
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,960
works and doesn't work in countries that

828
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,360
already have this model up and running

829
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,360
yeah that's a great question and the

830
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,879
answer is yes so um if we go back to the

831
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,600
yes so if we go back um to the steps

832
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,640
what we see is um in step six which is

833
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,720
post implementation activities the

834
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,960
primary goal in this is actually to

835
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,279
prepare for another round of development

836
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,240
so we see this more cyclical rather than

837
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,919
you know a straight line which i've

838
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,440
obviously illustrated it in a straight

839
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,559
line

840
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,360
but we see it as cyclical so if you have

841
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,520
a capability that exists

842
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,200
that would basically be starting at the

843
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,279
same point as as these post

844
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,279
implementation activities you'd be

845
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,399
starting by

846
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,640
wanting to do lessons learned from that

847
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,559
original round of development so we we

848
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,480
implemented a sector c cert we want to

849
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,480
improve it or add new capabilities so

850
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,480
let's start with lessons learned and

851
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
then go back to the beginning and and

852
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,640
start the process again yeah

853
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,000
thank you

854
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,720
hello my name is willis so thank you for

855
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,520
the presentation uh in my

856
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,279
professional capacity through last two

857
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,600
years i worked probably four teams from

858
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,919
step one to step five at least in the

859
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,679
middle for sectoral

860
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,840
and what triggered in your one of the

861
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,039
slides the definition that

862
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,360
sectorial set is the body of

863
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,559
for

864
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,640
which is responsible for incident

865
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,240
response

866
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,760
and i'm a little bit confused because

867
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,600
incident response

868
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,520
responsibility and responsibility

869
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,600
incident handling responsibility is the

870
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,200
asset owner

871
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,159
and sectorial set is not asset owner so

872
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,640
does it mean that it diminishes the

873
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,520
responsibility of asset owner or how do

874
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,520
you explain

875
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,600
this the first sentence because

876
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,000
i see it instantly from my experience as

877
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,320
well in in the field that if it's as

878
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,960
responsible so then

879
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,640
but you don't own the assets so this

880
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,279
responsibility is confused i would

881
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,320
suggest

882
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,880
not either to rephrase or add extra

883
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,080
explanation on this yeah so i i you know

884
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,279
now i'm thinking of it from like a risk

885
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,200
management perspective and saying who's

886
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,919
responsible ultimately responsible so i

887
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,480
think maybe maybe you're right we need

888
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,120
to take the word responsible uh not

889
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,360
quite so so literally um it is a body

890
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,919
that does conducts instant response and

891
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,679
management for a subset of economy it's

892
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,279
not ultimately responsible you are

893
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,399
correct there

894
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,240
so maybe that's a phrasing issue that

895
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,679
we'll address with that definition thank

896
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,679
you

897
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,320
hi i'm martin from norway i just want to

898
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,399
follow up on margot's question and this

899
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,320
is not a speech it's just a little bit

900
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,320
of background and context before i get

901
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,960
to my question but norway has more than

902
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,080
a decades experience with secretary

903
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,279
c-sorts

904
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,440
and i think the most successful ones

905
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,000
like energy and finance they came from

906
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,159
within the sector but then we also have

907
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,159
some examples of

908
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,360
a supervisory authority for a sector

909
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,840
trying to establish a sector of cesart

910
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,039
and they had trust issues yes

911
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,559
so you mentioned interested parties

912
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,880
does this framework provide any guidance

913
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,720
on who those interested parties should

914
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,000
be yes yes so we we talk about

915
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,720
what what a stakeholder is we define a

916
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,919
stakeholder um and

917
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,760
we don't really talk about like level of

918
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,840
interest you know what makes a party

919
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,519
interested or not but we talk about

920
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,039
those stakeholders

921
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,600
um and what how you can identify

922
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,960
stakeholders and make sure you're

923
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,039
contacting all the stakeholders

924
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,039
involving them in the process

925
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:03,919
um

926
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,159
it's interesting you mentioned

927
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,840
um sometimes

928
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,919
you know government

929
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,320
agencies having trouble with that trust

930
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,480
or something like that

931
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,279
one of the challenges we find is that if

932
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,399
a regulatory body also tries to lead the

933
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,159
sector sea cert

934
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,320
you have you have trust issues right

935
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,840
it's a big problem

936
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,919
but sometimes that's there are

937
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,679
there's mandates or things like that

938
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,120
that require it

939
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,399
but you're right our experience has been

940
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,799
the same um sector seizures that have

941
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,279
been more sort of like organically grown

942
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,480
from within um tend to have less issues

943
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,039
and i think it's it's probably because

944
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,919
um that organic sort of growth naturally

945
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,679
takes into account all the things that

946
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,039
that i've talked about or that we talk

947
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,640
about in this document

948
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,640
because when it's organic

949
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,880
you're you're basically just using your

950
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,159
community your your national

951
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,080
cybersecurity ecosystem and you're doing

952
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,279
it together

953
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,640
when you come with this top down

954
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,960
approach that's when i think you maybe

955
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,039
need something like this guide to make

956
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,720
sure you're taking all those

957
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,559
stakeholders into account and taking

958
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,559
their needs and desires into account as

959
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,760
well

960
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,039
so yeah

961
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,360
thank you

962
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,840
no more questions

963
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,039
no well

964
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,279
all right in that case let's thank

965
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,980
justine for the presentation thank you

966
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:33,739
[Applause]
