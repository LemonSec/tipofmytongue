24
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,560
at the end of the presentation so

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,100
customer said I'm Marco Caselli I I work

26
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,799
for the Siemens research Department

27
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,080
called cyber security and Trust I

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,600
started with Siemens five years ago and

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,840
I was also working for the siemenset

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,100
then I said I moved to to research here

31
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,840
uh I'm dealing with a lot of topics some

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,560
of them uh are focusing on OT attack

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,900
detection and response and what I want

34
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,000
to say is that we have a lot of

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,100
collaboration with universities we try

36
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,020
to engage as much as we can with

37
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,140
University and this is also why we met

38
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,140
with Daniel here at the University of

39
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,299
Regensburg he was uh quite uh eager to

40
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,340
start working on CTI and incident

41
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,200
response and then we start collaborating

42
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,140
on on this topic and what we're gonna

43
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,719
we're gonna present you today so uh

44
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,840
let's start with one thing uh CTI is a

45
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,879
broad topic we all know about that but

46
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,300
uh what we wanted to focus now is the

47
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,360
incident response uh representations and

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,080
standards and actually uh maybe most of

49
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,180
you know about that there are a lot of

50
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,520
standards and formats out there and uh

51
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,319
there is a community behind is

52
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,760
discussing

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,300
and in this presentation we're gonna

54
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,120
name some of them but of course we we

55
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,480
dig into the topic a lot and Daniel will

56
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,459
share some more information about some

57
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,860
of the of the standards

58
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,060
and

59
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,700
the point here was okay we have a lot of

60
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,959
Standards but how can we compare those

61
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,840
standards so how do I understand in this

62
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,300
case as a company what I want to use of

63
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,120
course I have to describe by use cases

64
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,120
and trying to understand what standards

65
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,959
what formats will fit my use cases and

66
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,879
this is exactly what we have been trying

67
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,000
to do and what we have studied for quite

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,800
some time now and finally there is a a

69
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,360
different slightly different kind of

70
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,200
topic because here is like I'm I know

71
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,580
what standards to use but is this enough

72
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,180
so uh when I have some incident response

73
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,519
represented in Center why can I really

74
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,400
talk with another company and share it

75
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,920
simply as that and then that company is

76
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,040
capable to use it the very same way I

77
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,640
use that standard well this is not so

78
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,819
this is not so easy and that's why we

79
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:50,220
started uh reasoning a little bit about

80
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,819
what kind of organizational factors uh

81
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,860
have a role when it comes to

82
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,580
representing incident response actions

83
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:05,580
and uh yeah again why did we start with

84
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,299
this or let's take even a step back what

85
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,659
it was at the very beginning well uh of

86
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,239
course the community our community here

87
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,940
has always thought how important it was

88
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,478
to have CTI artifacts that was how we

89
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:24,060
started talking about ctis and the

90
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,100
indicator compromise we were discussing

91
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,800
were of course IP addresses hash values

92
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,199
and then domains and so on and so I mean

93
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,360
that was the very beginning was very

94
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,699
important but then we decided to to go

95
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,360
beyond that and that going Beyond was

96
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,020
start starting thinking more about the

97
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,259
attacker's behavior and this is why we

98
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:47,820
have been talking about tactic

99
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,860
techniques and procedures and I don't

100
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,380
have to tell you what an attack in Cape

101
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,780
are because we have been discussing a

102
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,479
lot about this also during this

103
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,419
uh during this conference and that was a

104
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,460
very important shift we we started

105
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,440
understanding that it was more that we

106
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,720
had to collect to really understand what

107
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,620
was going on and what we want to uh tell

108
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,680
with this with this uh talk is that

109
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,139
there is even a broader perspective here

110
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,000
and this is the incident response

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,039
perspective and this is where all the

112
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:22,800
causes of action uh play an important

113
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
role and this is where again all these

114
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,440
standards and formats are are being

115
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,680
created and so I said there are a number

116
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,600
of that there is an open source

117
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,120
community and there are commercial tools

118
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,360
there here I we're just mentioning three

119
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,240
of them defended is promoted by maitre

120
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,880
again and then we had cacao and open C2

121
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,460
we as Siemens are actively participating

122
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,860
in the standardization of cacao and open

123
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,820
C2 we think this is gonna be a very

124
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,520
important topic for the future

125
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,580
and then let's talk about the motivation

126
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,560
again I want to go from a general

127
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,720
perspective to a more company

128
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,660
perspective and here I would say uh I

129
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,419
mean this really fits the the motto of

130
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,600
this conference it's about strengthening

131
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,460
uh the communities present together and

132
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,919
the general context in which we started

133
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,900
thinking at the importance of Playbook

134
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,080
was was sharing playbooks with the

135
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,259
within the community and also kind of

136
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,940
answering what it was promoted by by uh

137
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,979
governmental agencies as you can see

138
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,280
here there was this U.S executive order

139
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,580
that was really an explicitly discussing

140
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,280
about playbooks and the importance of

141
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,220
having this Playbook to uh to be shared

142
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,479
within the community and on the other

143
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:54,660
part of the Atlantic we are the EU cyber

144
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,120
Security Act and yet again the war was

145
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,639
not as explicit as in the U.S executive

146
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,860
order but again some reference to

147
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,800
Playbooks and how important it was to

148
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,960
really exchange this kind of information

149
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,360
across security teams

150
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,060
and then we go to the to the company

151
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,139
contexter said

152
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,599
Siemens has started being involved in

153
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,280
the topic and we joined uh one European

154
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,160
project it's called Concordia and for

155
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,860
whoever you of you don't know about the

156
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,720
process so that was one of the four

157
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,960
Pilots trying to build up this European

158
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,940
cyber security competence Center this

159
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,160
new entity within the European Union

160
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,699
that should handle uh cyber security

161
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,819
funds for for the next future within

162
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:45,060
this project we started thinking how to

163
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,639
use incident response standards and

164
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,740
representation we had a couple of use

165
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,099
cases in mind so of course automation

166
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,199
was was very important since the

167
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,180
beginning because when we have standards

168
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,940
with which we can represent information

169
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,860
then we can have a machine reading this

170
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,259
these standards so if we make it in a

171
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,180
way that this is machine readable this

172
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,780
will allow us to improve our automation

173
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,780
but of course as I said before Playbook

174
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,319
sharing across teams was very important

175
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,419
Siemens is a big organization we have

176
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,520
several teams working together that was

177
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,160
one of the thing uh that we we had in

178
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,580
mind and internal reporting was also one

179
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,700
other uh aspects here because that was

180
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,839
about uh providing some information to

181
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,899
to the board to management on what has

182
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,200
happened within an incident response

183
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,279
uh

184
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,779
process

185
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:50,580
and here before giving the the float to

186
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,580
Daniel I just wanted to say that we

187
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,740
start thinking to all these things and

188
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,779
we came up with some questions and we

189
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,420
wanted to also uh collect the feedback

190
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,440
from uh uh external Partners In this

191
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,300
case a university trying to understand

192
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,180
okay is there a good way to approach

193
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,480
this problem and I said before which

194
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,700
kind of representation should we use for

195
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,660
our our use cases and also thinking a

196
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,940
little bit at the next step when it

197
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,320
comes to the incident response

198
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,279
operations how will we integrate this

199
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:28,620
representation in our own pipeline in

200
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,160
our own two two chains and how do we

201
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,560
make sure that we can maintain all these

202
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,200
things over the years and over all the

203
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,540
changes we can within the company and

204
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,279
with this question I will give the flow

205
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,380
to Daniel to dig more into the topic

206
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,560
thanks Marco I pick up from here

207
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,080
um well what did we start out with well

208
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,660
we had we had a closer look at what

209
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,700
standards what standardization efforts

210
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,640
are already out there and then when we

211
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,560
had a closer look at them we could see

212
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,440
that they have different objectives and

213
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,200
those objectives we can use them to do a

214
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,720
categorization so on that slide here you

215
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,180
can see that there are there are efforts

216
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,220
that are more on a high level approach

217
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,980
so we could say those are Frameworks for

218
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,579
example react or micro defend then there

219
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:19,440
are also others that Center more on the

220
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,660
procedural aspects of incident response

221
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,180
we call them Playbook formats and

222
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,760
prominent example here is Cacao and then

223
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,920
last going on a granular level talking

224
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,519
about individual commands that is you

225
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,320
can represent those incident response

226
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,680
commands using cacao roughly you can say

227
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,180
left hand side is more for

228
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,579
representation right-hand side is more

229
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:45,720
for incident response operations

230
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,100
so

231
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,440
even before looking at the incident

232
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,540
response standards and formats we

233
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,579
thought about what is incident response

234
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:57,540
actually all about and at its heart it's

235
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,120
all about a few Structural Concepts

236
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,459
eventually

237
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:05,640
um it is a series of workflow steps

238
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,279
where a certain person or certain system

239
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,339
the actuator is performing an action on

240
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:12,980
a certain artifact

241
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,540
let me give you some very simplified

242
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,579
examples here you can think of incident

243
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:19,680
response as there is an analyst

244
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,899
investigating a file a security system

245
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,180
blocking an IP address or an incident

246
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,480
response Handler writing a report our

247
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,899
results of our analysis even show that

248
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,820
all standards and formats that we looked

249
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,579
at they have a thing in common that they

250
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,560
Center that they cover the incident

251
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,240
response actions with the other

252
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,040
Structural Concepts not so much they're

253
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,339
the different efforts vary and how they

254
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,040
handle or how they wrap how yeah

255
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,660
actuators or artifacts can be

256
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,260
represented

257
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,700
so having the standardization efforts

258
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,779
for the analysis you want to have

259
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:00,600
criteria how to do the analysis and

260
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,639
while we initially had only the

261
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,279
Structural Concepts which are workflow

262
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,920
actuator action and artifact we thought

263
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,680
them there must be more to it to

264
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,480
actually tell different standards

265
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,240
different formats apart

266
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,399
yeah our approach here we published in a

267
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,680
scientific paper and what we did we

268
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,019
derived additional Concepts that are

269
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,079
that we think and are relevant our

270
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,180
approach here was based on yeah we

271
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,680
looked at what's out there in academic

272
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,680
literature but also looking at the

273
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,560
standardization efforts and arriving

274
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,260
more Concepts here

275
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:37,800
um

276
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,540
as you can see there are general

277
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,160
concepts we think are relevant

278
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,839
technology Concepts and security

279
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,660
Concepts uh to give you some give you

280
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,940
some insights here for example it's

281
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,500
important that you incident response

282
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,060
information can be bundled somehow

283
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,700
together so that's aggregability then

284
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,100
you want to have some versioning you

285
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,380
want to have some readability machine

286
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,779
readability or only human readability

287
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,600
depending on your use case that's

288
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,380
important and yeah technology side is

289
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,480
there a community behind a standard how

290
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,579
is it applied what kind of serialization

291
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,980
does it use and then on a secure it from

292
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,800
a security perspective

293
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,139
um can I indicate that information that

294
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,060
is represented has a certain

295
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,620
confidentiality

296
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,279
um is the way to express how to

297
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:29,040
um yeah how to how how incident response

298
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,740
information needs to be authorized and

299
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,139
before the action is actually executed

300
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:37,139
and then also prioritization in case you

301
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:39,000
have multiple playbooks you might want

302
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,440
to do one before another

303
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,320
um how does it look for one specific

304
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,139
standard I pick cacao here

305
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,680
um yeah so cacao characteristics are as

306
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,600
you can hear and see on this slide so

307
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,720
cacao has workflow steps it calls its

308
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,240
actuator targets and there are commands

309
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,699
with the parenthesis parentheses you see

310
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:04,980
on the slide those concepts are only

311
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,560
covered to some extent so there is yeah

312
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,320
I guess room for improvement redefining

313
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,860
it in a new iteration of the standard

314
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,940
um

315
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,459
yeah this all leads us to the question

316
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:20,339
your representatives or you work in

317
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:21,660
companies you want to use those

318
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,639
standards and

319
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:26,579
the overall question is you have a

320
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,440
certain use case which format which

321
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,500
standard should you use and we think

322
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,320
it's best if you refer to back to those

323
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,980
Core Concepts and use them to assess if

324
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,100
a certain format is suitable or not

325
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,019
um eventually you could do what we did

326
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,480
here as an example for the use case of

327
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,540
incident response sharing you can rank

328
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,040
them as there are certain Concepts

329
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,620
mandatory you definitely need them then

330
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,740
there are others that are supportive and

331
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,220
even others that are less relevant

332
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,220
pick a few examples here workflow we

333
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,740
think you definitely need to document

334
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,019
the workflow of your incident response

335
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,880
steps if you want that if you want to

336
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,320
share that with others also

337
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,380
aggregability bundle things together if

338
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,600
you want to share and then

339
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,800
confidentiality I think I guess that's

340
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,740
easy to see

341
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,820
making clear if you're sharing

342
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,940
internally or even externally how does

343
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,620
the information how confidential is the

344
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,560
information

345
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,100
so

346
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,880
as you can see here the green uh green

347
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,759
orange and wild ranking the concepts

348
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,639
that's what we thought of obviously you

349
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,500
can assess more about the organizational

350
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,560
context and determine what you think is

351
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,540
mandatory or not

352
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,259
um as it turns out if we use it if you

353
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:51,120
use if you use the ranking as we just

354
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,880
did then Cacao is a suitable candidate

355
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,100
for incident response sharing and why is

356
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,380
that well Cacao is playbooks that

357
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,600
aggregate information procedures are

358
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,120
represented by workflows there's a The

359
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,300
Oasis Community behind cacao to back the

360
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,600
standard and then you have TLP and I IEP

361
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,060
to address confidentiality also on the

362
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,660
structure here on the slide you can see

363
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,759
I took that I took the graphic from The

364
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,620
Oasis standard so there's some

365
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,139
documentation in on the high level you

366
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:23,579
have the Playbook element and then

367
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:26,519
workflow and workflow steps

368
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,240
um

369
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,420
so this was all about representing

370
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,639
incident response information but what

371
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,920
about actual operations actually using

372
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,560
the information and then we think it's

373
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,540
really crucial you always use incident

374
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,820
response within your company within your

375
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,519
organization so context matters and

376
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:49,440
emphasized here with the graphic

377
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,420
um you might just see a small picture

378
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,480
but it's it's it's it's important to see

379
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,160
the bigger picture

380
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,980
um so does context matter that's the

381
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,259
real question here

382
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,140
um looking at the playbooks

383
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,220
playbooks always contain some technical

384
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,619
information Ural incident you all have

385
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,179
to do with incident response in your

386
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:10,619
daily life

387
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,539
um so there's technical information to

388
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:14,579
be handled such as you want to block a

389
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,500
certain IP address you execute a script

390
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,079
execute a certain command but then

391
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,459
there's also

392
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,020
other information that needs to be

393
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,640
considered and that's the organizational

394
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,039
information

395
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,660
let's say your company has a ransomware

396
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,039
expert

397
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,620
um Jane Doe so in the case you have a

398
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,539
ransomware incident you probably contact

399
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:34,760
her

400
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,760
and this this raises two more questions

401
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,460
is organization specific information

402
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,700
important and what does determine which

403
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,919
information is specific to your

404
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:49,260
organization

405
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,660
um we assume that

406
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,840
yeah the organizational information

407
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,000
shapes the incident response process so

408
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,740
there that there are certain factors

409
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,780
that do influence how you do incident

410
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,039
response

411
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,500
three examples we picked here

412
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,080
um that could be privacy do you are you

413
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,539
doing incident response in the European

414
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,000
Union or is it is your incident response

415
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,080
affecting EU customer data then you

416
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,740
might consider the gdpr regulation also

417
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,780
for responsibility the organization has

418
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,820
a certain chain of command

419
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,299
um defines how how to do reporting how

420
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:31,260
how to how which people to involve so

421
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,820
that needs to be considered an incident

422
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,340
response process and then also people

423
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,039
depending on the year security team size

424
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,720
do you have five people or 100 people

425
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,240
that should make a difference here we

426
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,120
want to ask you do you disagree with us

427
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,820
do you think these factors may be also

428
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,640
others do they not influence the

429
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,820
incident response process and we have

430
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,460
preferred something here we would like

431
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,520
you to get your feedback so please scan

432
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,039
the QR code participation is obviously

433
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:05,700
voluntary and Anonymous but we are very

434
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,940
very keen to hear your feedback

435
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,799
um do you think there are factors that

436
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,840
influence the incident response process

437
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,160
I think you can go I hope that turns out

438
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,100
that works with the live thing I mean I

439
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,360
if it doesn't work we will take the

440
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,500
questions physically

441
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,860
I know it's it's it's difficult to type

442
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,100
in but we thought you get the slides

443
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,178
um in the app so

444
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,200
okay I got some results in

445
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,720
um I guess most of us most of you agree

446
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,039
with us

447
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,559
um you can still the slides are shared

448
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,380
with you so you can you can still answer

449
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:18,260
the poll afterwards and yeah

450
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,720
this this leader leads us to explain to

451
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,840
you why we think or how we think those

452
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,820
factors can modify incident response

453
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,480
obviously there's a just some very basic

454
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,120
examples and as an example we start off

455
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,919
with a baseline incident response

456
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:36,059
process

457
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,280
um that is you got an incident you sign

458
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,620
an incident Handler you have actions one

459
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,299
actions two course of actions one

460
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,340
because of actions two and then you do

461
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,020
reporting to the stock manager and the

462
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,340
process ends

463
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,460
well in the first scenario

464
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,039
um you can think of that as I just

465
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,760
mentioned earlier the EU gdpr applies

466
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,640
and that could be that for cursive

467
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,679
action step two

468
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,740
um it involves customer data so you add

469
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,020
an additional Playbook step before that

470
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,120
in that case you contact the legal

471
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,980
department to check if you can actually

472
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,260
do whatever you plan to do in cursive

473
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,419
action too otherwise the process stays

474
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:16,500
the same

475
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,539
different scenario

476
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:21,600
um that could be based on what attackers

477
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,700
what information you have about the

478
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,740
attacker and the attacker group

479
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,900
um and how you define responsibility in

480
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,460
your company

481
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,679
um so this could lead to branching off

482
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,020
the process that oh yeah you've seen

483
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,240
similar activity before that was crucial

484
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,820
to the organization so you add an

485
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,220
additional step for reporting to the

486
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,280
ceso and doing other courses of action

487
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,580
besides what you would have done usually

488
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,760
and a third scenario is about

489
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,100
um yeah do you have certain constraints

490
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,039
defined on technical level so that could

491
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:59,520
be curse of action 2 has you do block a

492
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,039
certain IP address that would be in case

493
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,960
you receive the Playbook from external

494
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,720
it says yeah Please block certain IP

495
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,360
address but then your organization your

496
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,539
company has defined that we don't we

497
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,120
don't do blocking we do a redirect

498
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,100
um so this could lead to a modification

499
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,059
of a Playbook step

500
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,360
um

501
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,059
why is that why are those factors

502
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:26,100
relevant I mean you've seen they can

503
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,919
lead to a modification of a Playbook but

504
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:31,140
why are they relevant on a yeah broader

505
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,740
broader scope and we think that they can

506
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,840
help you if we know about this incident

507
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,880
response factors that they can help you

508
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,760
to separate information in the technical

509
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,940
part and the organizational part and

510
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,320
eventually seen here on the on the slide

511
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,659
you can have a transformation engine

512
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:53,280
ingesting both types of information so

513
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,960
you get a Playbook that's specific to

514
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,600
your organization

515
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,580
benefits are if you're sharing playbooks

516
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,419
that can help you to actually use them

517
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:05,940
adaption semi-automation because every

518
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,440
organization has different systems

519
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,080
different processes so that will help

520
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,200
you here and then maintenance yeah if

521
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,940
you change information if changes occur

522
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,179
you don't need to figure out like

523
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:20,520
ideally you would type in all the

524
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,500
organizational information nation and if

525
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,419
there's a change there you can have the

526
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:28,940
same yeah the same the same method

527
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,840
adapting the technical information

528
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:34,320
um

529
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,900
we picked three incident response

530
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,740
factors before but the whole thing about

531
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,600
incident response factors is a part of

532
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,880
an ongoing research project

533
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,539
um

534
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:48,299
what you see here that's what we came up

535
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:51,120
with but that's in early stages we tried

536
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,640
to validate are those really incident

537
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,620
response factors that need to be

538
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,200
considered they can be categorized so

539
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,840
there's the external regulation

540
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,299
compliance elements so depending on if

541
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:05,460
your company is publicly listed where

542
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,919
you're located at

543
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:09,779
privacy and sector that can influence

544
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:12,059
the overall incident response process

545
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,880
also internal policy we have the example

546
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,400
with a few constrain certain technical

547
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,440
things you don't copy files when you do

548
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,860
an analyst analysis or you you do not

549
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,659
block IP addresses that could be the

550
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:27,120
case also attacker how you do your

551
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,100
communication how you do your reporting

552
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,460
responsibility and what is the tact that

553
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,779
could make a difference to the incident

554
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:36,480
response process and last the overall

555
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,460
security setting in your company

556
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,559
how much money do we have how much

557
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,720
people do you have what technology are

558
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,140
you using and are there limits on how

559
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,779
long you can do incident response yeah

560
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,100
investigations

561
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,020
those might all be factors that

562
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,720
influence incident response processes

563
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,000
and that needs that need to be

564
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,340
considered for the playbooks

565
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,799
um yeah we do expert interviews I've

566
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,600
already done a few

567
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,200
um yeah with uh with people working in

568
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,080
industry and what we've seen so far the

569
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,700
polynomial preliminary feedback is that

570
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,980
um yeah most of them see that there are

571
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,080
incident response factors that play a

572
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,080
role but to varying degrees and

573
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,659
organizations already consider those but

574
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:27,720
might not yeah but but they might not

575
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,500
mention them explicitly so here

576
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,299
additional feedback needed we're at the

577
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,940
conference until Friday and I'm happy to

578
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,460
talk to you if you want to share your

579
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,640
your thoughts about the topic and that

580
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,559
just leads us to thank you for your

581
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,659
attention if any if you have any

582
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:47,279
questions I think with some minutes here

583
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,000
otherwise yeah you can still do the poll

584
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,159
with the QR code up there so thanks

585
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:55,010
thanks

586
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:58,279
[Applause]

587
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,120
so we have 10 minutes left for

588
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,940
presentations uh for questions sorry

589
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,799
Hello My Name Is Willows so thank you

590
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,380
very much for this dissection I

591
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,240
definitely will use it in my work on

592
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,380
what you did

593
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,480
one question for the example use case

594
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,779
for incident response sharing yeah I

595
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:17,580
would expect that artifact to be

596
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,700
mandatory not optional or supportive

597
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,020
what was the logic to make it

598
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,740
supportive

599
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,539
um to give the others the same slide

600
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:31,919
again

601
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,220
um yeah the thing here was depending on

602
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,200
who you're sharing with

603
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,799
um you might not want to disclose that

604
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,980
it involves a certain file hash or it

605
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,659
involves a certain

606
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:48,240
IP address domain

607
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,059
um so that might be still some artifacts

608
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:52,799
right so at least some artifacts have to

609
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,000
be shared because otherwise what's the

610
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,320
meaning of sharing if you don't share

611
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,840
anything just action of sharing

612
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,059
yeah I would say so I mean it really

613
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:03,779
depends on the specific case but what we

614
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:06,120
wanted to to Define here is it's maybe

615
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,419
depending on the uh on the kind of

616
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,159
information you want to share with other

617
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,679
teams you might want to share more about

618
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,840
the procedure and the actions rather

619
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,059
than say Hey you have to do exactly that

620
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:20,159
it really depends on who you're talking

621
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,460
to if it is a technique if he or she is

622
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,380
a technical guy yeah for sure you're

623
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,880
going to talk about the artifacts what

624
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,399
do you have to search for but maybe it's

625
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,260
it's head of a search and then you want

626
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,240
to to explain a little bit more the

627
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,279
concept behind what you did and not the

628
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,880
whole process

629
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,960
thanks

630
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,159
any other questions

631
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,260
okay it doesn't seem to be the case so

632
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:54,440
thank you very much Daniel and Marco

633
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,779
so now Lounge is served downstairs don't

634
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:00,240
forget there will be the AGM and the

635
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,279
membership Updates this afternoon and

636
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:04,860
social event this evening we've said I

637
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,440
hope you enjoy your lunch and see you

638
