[Music]

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,599
there's one more

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,559
participant possibly two

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,559
welcome

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,279
but

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,439
welcome to everybody uh the few people

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,000
that are here they're people online

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,680
to this impromptu talk on global

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,240
instance response in a fragmented world

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,240
this talk is gonna kind of overlap a lot

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,880
with the presentation yesterday by my

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,800
colleague sheriff hashim it's going to

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,960
be about how does the international

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,120
community

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,280
do

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,840
incidence response in a world where

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,879
things are getting a little bit

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,600
difficult

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,840
kind of some time ago there was this

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,200
headline where

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,120
google security team

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,600
patched a zero day that was known to be

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,879
used in a nation-state operation

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,879
the special thing about this is the

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,120
nation-state operation was conducted by

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,239
the u.s by the very country where google

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,080
engineers were working from and there's

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,400
a lot of conversation and

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,320
controversy about is this the right

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,680
thing to do

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,000
google argued and i agree with this

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,439
point of view that

33
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,360
security vulnerabilities should not be

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,720
used

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,119
to the detriment of users globally and

36
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,600
it puts the users of google products in

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,000
this case chrome at risk so

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
but is this

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,079
how it works is this how it should be

40
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,600
that's the question a question that's

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,119
discussed on the highest level and

42
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,640
that's what i'm going to talk a little

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,799
bit about

44
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,840
today policymakers are discussing

45
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,159
on about the rules of engagement about

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,759
how

47
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,399
instance response teams but how states

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,399
should behave in cyberspace this wasn't

49
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,920
always the case

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,320
in 1996

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,040
at the world economic forum in in davos

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,719
john perry barlow

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,439
which some of you may know as the head

54
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,920
behind the band grateful dad

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,280
published his declaration of

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,119
independence of cyberspace i recommend

57
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,318
you read this it really calls for states

58
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,239
and corporations to stay out of the

59
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,520
internet

60
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,080
these days

61
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,080
are long long gone states have

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,239
recognized that the internet is around

63
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,000
and they're conducting operations in the

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,480
internet

65
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,360
just to give you a brief overview

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
the first one that i know of kind of

67
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,959
that's been publicly

68
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,400
made available is titan reign in 2003

69
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,720
nearly 20 years ago

70
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,680
then uh

71
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,519
where a chinese allegedly chinese actor

72
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,599
attacked a u.s defense contractor and

73
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,680
stole a lot of intellectual property

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,040
then 2009 for me this was kind of

75
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,640
a shock

76
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,800
aurora ghost net was discovered an

77
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,519
attack again by the chinese on

78
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,840
the diaspora of the dalai lama on civil

79
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,560
society and that for me was kind of a

80
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,840
shocking thing a state attacking

81
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,159
civilians when you go on 2010 we had

82
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,000
stuxnet you see here

83
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,720
the picture of a street sign in iran

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,400
natanz where this

85
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,080
iranian uranium

86
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,120
enrichment facility is that stuxnet kind

87
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,440
of tried to slow down or bring down to

88
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,040
its knees

89
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,800
and today we can kind of stop counting

90
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,959
there's so many state of

91
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,239
uh

92
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,080
operations going on

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,319
that it's not really worth

94
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,319
counting

95
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,159
should we be doing this should states be

96
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,680
doing this that's a very good question

97
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,519
let's look back and see try to figure

98
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,519
out what is it states actually do in the

99
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,840
internet we read a lot about cyber war

100
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,959
in the news recently the center for

101
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,080
foreign

102
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,640
relations has a website that lists all

103
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,599
the known state operations and makes

104
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,879
these available

105
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,720
actually as a json file so it's pretty

106
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,760
cool you can use this

107
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
and when you look at what states mostly

108
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,720
do

109
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,480
there's a somewhat of a surprise it's

110
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,000
not cyber war it's espionage

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,879
states are spying on each other

112
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,319
that's not something new they've always

113
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,599
been doing this

114
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,519
and why are they doing this because it's

115
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,440
perfectly legal

116
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,600
states are entitled to spy on each other

117
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,639
if you ask representatives of a state

118
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,160
if that should be illegal they all say

119
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,400
no states actually love this because it

120
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,080
gives them intelligence that helps their

121
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,400
policy makers to help their governments

122
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,040
to make decisions about

123
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,960
the capabilities or about the intentions

124
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,320
of other states so they don't want to

125
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,960
give up on this

126
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,199
has it become more well yes it has

127
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,479
clearly

128
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,800
the state operations are growing

129
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,520
now you can argue while espionage i mean

130
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,440
states have always been spying on each

131
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,960
other we know this we all watch james

132
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,560
bond movies

133
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,880
nothing new really is this a problem

134
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,120
hasn't has it been a problem in the past

135
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,039
that states spied on each other it

136
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,360
hasn't in the past

137
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,280
but it has become a problem in my view

138
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,240
today

139
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,919
if you take one of the

140
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:08,720
big

141
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,960
cyber operations in the past couple of

142
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,080
months

143
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,280
the exploit of the exchange

144
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,960
vulnerability

145
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,120
that has clearly been a state-sponsored

146
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,800
operation has been an espionage

147
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,000
operation because there's mostly

148
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,759
government agencies that are affected by

149
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,400
it

150
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,680
but it has had a huge collateral damage

151
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,840
instance responders people that knew me

152
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,720
had to kind of work overtime to fix the

153
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,000
collaterals

154
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,720
once the vulnerabilities became public

155
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,639
criminals jumped on it especially

156
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,360
ransomware groups creating

157
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,960
huge damages

158
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,680
and

159
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
i think that is a game changer just

160
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,000
imagine if one state spies on another

161
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,320
one and blows up in a

162
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,919
kind of a build a garment building to

163
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,400
get access to information

164
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
nobody would tolerate this but in an

165
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,160
asian state actually

166
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,160
kind of conducting a an operation that

167
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
then leads to so much collateral damage

168
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,000
ransomware groups infecting hospitals

169
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,120
and so on

170
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,880
no one really seems to care and i think

171
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,759
that is a bit of a problem

172
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,120
now

173
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,240
why is

174
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
espionage while these cyber operations

175
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,080
in cyberspace

176
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,840
so much different from

177
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,280
from the same thing in the physical

178
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,120
world and that really is because

179
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,960
cyberspace has some things that in my

180
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,240
view

181
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,160
are kind of different

182
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,479
so there's first of all

183
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,080
i used to call this there's no borders

184
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
in the internet but that's kind of a i'm

185
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,680
not even sure what the concept of

186
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,000
borders means but what this is about is

187
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,319
that the sovereignty of a state naming

188
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,080
namely that you can do a new state what

189
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,360
you want

190
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,199
is no longer tied

191
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,599
to territoriality so the internet blurs

192
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,840
this in the olden times the spies had to

193
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,280
kind of travel into your country you

194
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,080
could protect it for them there's only a

195
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,800
certain number of spies that could go in

196
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,720
and that is a big challenge

197
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,560
that sovereignty versus territoriality

198
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,080
thing is a really big problem it affects

199
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,919
other parts of

200
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,240
cyberspace cloud act for example is

201
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,400
something that has to do with that where

202
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,639
the u.s tries to get information it's

203
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,160
actually not physically stored on their

204
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,360
territory

205
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,440
it's a big thing then attribution is

206
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,560
hard

207
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,319
really that is still one of the biggest

208
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,479
challenges how can you have rules if you

209
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,680
uh if you don't know who

210
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,039
who the actor was and

211
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,360
furthermore then you have what i call

212
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,440
class breaks

213
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,840
if you want to kind of rob a bank or spy

214
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,919
on a garment all style you have to go

215
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,440
there you can do

216
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,720
one garment agency at a time by kind of

217
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,599
getting us by a mole in and you can do

218
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,360
hundreds of them at the time we saw this

219
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
in these recent big attacks there were

220
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,120
thousands of government agencies

221
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,599
affected

222
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,199
and it's a lot easier because the rate

223
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,199
of innovation in cyberspace in the

224
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,759
internet is so high

225
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,919
this barely a week where not something

226
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,759
new comes out that that you have to

227
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,280
learn that you as a defender have to

228
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,280
understand how it works and so you can

229
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,360
protect it now we have the internet of

230
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,960
things where we seem to repeat all the

231
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,879
same mistakes we've done 20 years ago in

232
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,240
server software

233
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
and so on that makes it a lot harder

234
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,840
there hasn't really been much progress

235
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,039
in kind of

236
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,240
securing physical buildings and

237
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,400
we know how to do this

238
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,080
then there's the asymmetric capabilities

239
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,759
a few people can attack thousands of uh

240
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,479
of victims and vice versa a bunch of

241
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,159
teenagers can actually take a garment

242
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,360
down

243
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
and that doesn't make things easier

244
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,958
again that doesn't exist in the physical

245
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,039
group and last but not least there's no

246
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,560
global authority there's no one that

247
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,399
really can go there and say

248
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,240
you did something wrong

249
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,600
you're going to get your finger slapped

250
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,399
now

251
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,120
how do states uh

252
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,279
react to that well states actually have

253
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,640
been recognizing this problem

254
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,440
and

255
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,360
currently there's two groups

256
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,880
at the united nations level that are

257
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,800
active in this one of the oldest one is

258
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,640
the united nations garmental group of

259
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,040
experts i wrote down the full title this

260
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,720
is really government speech i'm not even

261
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,680
gonna

262
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,279
try to start

263
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,440
reading this out

264
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,839
typically these are two-year groups um

265
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,600
they started in 2004

266
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,200
and

267
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,880
were kind of

268
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,399
these hand-picked

269
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,480
states in the beginning 2004 is really

270
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,560
very few states it showed an interest so

271
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,959
it wasn't really a problem the last one

272
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,519
there was quite kind of a

273
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,120
demand and a lot of states wanted to get

274
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,720
into it was quite a competition to get

275
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,920
into

276
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,560
but it is what it is so

277
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,800
the highlights of the united of this

278
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,440
ungge it was 2013 so 2013 nine years

279
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,519
after they started

280
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,360
they came up with a report saying hey

281
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,279
actually we think international law

282
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,920
should halt in cyberspace so

283
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,600
states are regulated by international

284
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,680
laws that's what you can do for example

285
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,240
you you must never attack

286
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,839
another country unless you have a

287
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,160
mandate from the security council or you

288
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,240
do it in self defense these type of

289
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,120
things hold in cyberspace

290
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,800
but what does that mean we'll come to

291
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,680
that

292
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,880
2015 the next group actually came out

293
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,880
with 11 what's called norms and i'm

294
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,200
going to explain you what norms are

295
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,279
of responsible state behavior in

296
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,440
cyberspace

297
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,519
so that was actually

298
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,079
probably the two most successful unggs

299
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,279
then

300
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,000
in 2019

301
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,760
people some people felt it's actually

302
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,600
not okay that we

303
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,839
we only have 25 states that talk about

304
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,600
this because the internet is becoming a

305
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,399
global infrastructure so they started

306
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,160
what's called the open-ended working

307
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,399
group

308
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,800
which included every country that wanted

309
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,839
to participate

310
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,640
um

311
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,079
that group was restarted actually uh

312
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,800
last year with a five-year mandate

313
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,399
the last group didn't really have a

314
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,120
substantial output it could reaffirm

315
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,440
what ungg

316
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,040
did

317
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,880
but nothing more than that and we could

318
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,240
go into the details if you're into

319
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,760
political science you can spend a lot of

320
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,160
time arguing about this it was good that

321
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,600
people talk but not really much came out

322
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,120
now why am i telling you this

323
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,760
the reason is

324
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,959
that states start making the rules

325
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,720
on how we engage in the internet and

326
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,480
this has a direct effect on us so first

327
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,680
feeling that

328
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
we are part of the internet we are part

329
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,959
of the people that actually make the

330
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,120
internet run

331
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,959
should play a role

332
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,320
un recognizes this and understands

333
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,200
that the internet is not current and

334
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,000
owned or operated by states and it uses

335
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,680
what it calls a multi-stakeholder

336
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
process so if you if you kind of hang

337
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,399
out in international organizations you

338
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,639
hear this word multi-stakeholder

339
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,480
all the time what it really means is you

340
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,560
should not only listen to states but all

341
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
the other important players and we were

342
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,240
really lucky to be actually one of these

343
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,160
players first

344
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,800
several times now presented at united

345
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,600
nations to the delegates of all these

346
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,639
states discussing these things

347
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,959
just on a side remark

348
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,000
there's

349
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,680
a third group at the united nations it's

350
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,760
called the attack committee on cyber

351
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,920
crime in short where people talk about

352
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,040
the new cyber crime convention

353
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,920
interestingly enough cybersecurity

354
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,320
and cybercrime at the un level are two

355
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,160
totally different things

356
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,839
the cybersecurity stuff is in what's

357
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,440
called the first committee the part of

358
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,959
the u.n that talks about weapons of mass

359
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,440
destruction so i guess it's kind of an

360
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,200
honor to be in that part

361
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,880
whereas this one is more kind of on the

362
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,160
uh

363
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,480
with the organization of a drug and

364
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,279
crime so yeah i just said that

365
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,760
what all these bodies do is they're

366
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,360
going to come out with norms they're

367
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,959
going to come out with recommendations

368
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:15,600
and

369
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,680
that's just the un level there's many

370
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,519
more organizations that come out with

371
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,200
these you may have heard of the paris

372
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,560
call i had a couple of years

373
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,680
done in by president macron in france

374
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,680
who said this is how we should behave in

375
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,519
cyberspace

376
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,200
the best practices forum has put them

377
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,959
together there is a

378
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,200
hundreds of norms

379
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,600
out there now i've used that word quite

380
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,240
a bit what are norms

381
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,199
today

382
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,199
it's pretty hard to get new

383
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,440
international law down international law

384
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,760
is binding you can in principle sue

385
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,519
another state for violating this

386
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,360
but everybody agrees we're not going to

387
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,279
get this working right now people just

388
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,959
the atmosphere is too poisoned for that

389
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,959
to happen the next best thing you can do

390
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,959
is norms norms are things

391
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,519
that are not technically illegal but you

392
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,399
just don't do it if you've ever tried

393
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,000
to kind of

394
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,199
catch a bus or so in in london

395
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,839
uk and i guess in ireland you'll notice

396
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,079
that people queue up there's no law that

397
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,000
says you have to queue up it's just

398
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
something people do and if you if you

399
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,959
kind of

400
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,040
walk the queue and try to get in first

401
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,240
people aren't going to give you a hard

402
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,760
time but the police is not going to show

403
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,120
up that's what the norm is it's a

404
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,199
voluntary kind of agreement hey yes we

405
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,199
all stick to the same rules often not

406
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,480
written down

407
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,760
interestingly most of international law

408
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,399
is what's called

409
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
um now words are slipped

410
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,000
it's norms it's stuff it's customary

411
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,240
international law it's not written down

412
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,920
and it's things people have always been

413
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,760
doing in the past

414
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,360
norms have become customary

415
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,199
international law and after certain time

416
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,040
so if states stick to this stuff for 10

417
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,279
years 20 years it actually becomes

418
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,440
binding they can't go back and say okay

419
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,680
but we never agreed to this because an

420
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,519
international court would say

421
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,440
but you stuck to it for the past 20

422
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,720
years

423
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,120
now i mentioned these 15 norms that the

424
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,680
ungg came out with and i don't want to

425
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,399
go

426
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,320
through all of them in detail

427
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,000
let's just point out

428
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
a couple of things and the good news

429
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,480
really is is we are in cesar zorin

430
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,399
there's this norm k that essentially

431
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,279
says

432
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,360
states

433
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,920
should not attack each other's instance

434
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,560
response teams

435
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,040
c-series are the only group explicitly

436
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,440
mentioned several times in this u.n

437
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
negotiations and that gives us kind of a

438
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,880
special role states it seems recognize

439
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,639
the value of the work we do as people

440
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,320
who defend the internet who keep the

441
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,880
internet running who defend the users

442
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,720
and there's a prize for that it also

443
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,800
means we should not be offensive we

444
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,399
should not be part of attacks

445
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,320
in 2021 the ungg also said

446
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,839
states please stop politicizing c-suits

447
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,480
do not kind of use t-shirts

448
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,800
as an instrument to play politics and

449
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,560
again this is a very very strong

450
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,399
statement i feel

451
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,839
it's not law

452
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,920
but it is a something that states are

453
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,680
encouraged to do

454
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,079
now so you may say welp does this really

455
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,000
kind of affect us i mean

456
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,600
it's all good and right what states do

457
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,839
it doesn't really affect me i mean

458
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,440
it's never ever a president has shown up

459
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,320
at

460
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,440
my office

461
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,959
so what then and i'll give you an

462
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,120
example there's another norm that states

463
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
should actually

464
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,120
handle vulnerabilities

465
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,519
uh responsibly we just saw they don't do

466
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,199
this

467
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,199
no one really reported this exchange

468
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,880
vulnerabilities another example is the

469
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,199
log4j which i think is a very

470
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,639
interesting example because it was

471
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,240
discovered by alibaba a chinese company

472
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,079
alibaba did what it was supposed to do

473
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,639
what we expected to do it reported this

474
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,720
to the developers

475
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,079
told them hey there is an issue the

476
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,959
developers put out an update and

477
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,280
gave us time to fix this

478
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,039
turns out the chinese government was

479
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,599
very very unhappy with alibaba they lost

480
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,160
the big contract because china argued

481
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
well you should have told us about this

482
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,480
vulnerability first before it is closing

483
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,160
it

484
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,319
that's not really unique to china

485
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,079
the u.s and the uk in particular have

486
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,439
what's called a

487
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,439
vulnerability equity process that

488
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,679
describes how they decide

489
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,960
when to keep

490
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,919
a vulnerability secret or not

491
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,760
the us obviously did keep a couple of

492
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,679
vulnerabilities

493
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,640
secret we saw this with the first slide

494
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,240
and google actually found out about the

495
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,559
vulnerability in chrome

496
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,960
and patched it

497
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,200
so

498
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,440
but again what does that mean for us

499
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,080
it's all states it's just states

500
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,320
what are the obligations for private

501
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,480
industry what are the obligations for

502
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,799
software vendors and

503
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,400
that is a very good question to ask and

504
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,360
no one really knows what this is

505
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,400
um

506
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,000
the swiss garment started a process

507
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,520
called the geneva dialogue where it

508
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,120
tries to bring together people from

509
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
software development companies to try to

510
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,720
figure out what does it mean what does

511
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,039
it mean to do responsible vulnerability

512
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,720
disclosure how can we do this why

513
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,320
doesn't it really work

514
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,600
and

515
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,919
kind of me being the naive guys at first

516
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,600
has all these

517
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,360
has all these guidelines out so what

518
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,360
you're talking about but it's really

519
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,039
important that states start to

520
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,240
understand

521
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,720
what this implies and start to kind of

522
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,200
um create processes if you look at

523
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,960
switzerland switzerland has decided to

524
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,600
not stockpile vulnerabilities so that's

525
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,640
the swiss position that's published

526
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,200
the uk and the u.s haven't and

527
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,120
no water state so far to my knowledge

528
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,120
has actually made a statement on how

529
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,559
they treat this

530
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,960
but even if states like the us and uk

531
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,360
say we actually keep vulnerabilities in

532
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,760
certain cases

533
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,679
them admitting this is a really good

534
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,000
important thing because it actually

535
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,240
tells you where they stand and you may

536
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,799
have a problem there

537
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,480
it hasn't really solved

538
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,640
the dilemma that google as a us entity

539
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,039
is in if it finds something if it finds

540
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,280
another vulnerability that is used by

541
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,360
its own government and that is something

542
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,280
we have to figure out

543
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,760
now

544
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,400
i mentioned you to you that first is a

545
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,120
has done several kind of inputs at the

546
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,919
united nations by what is first position

547
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,240
our position really is is that it's

548
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,039
really important that whatever norms and

549
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,760
laws states decide on they should make

550
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,000
sure that instance responders can keep

551
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,559
working the way they used to that means

552
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,480
you should not criminalize the tools we

553
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,320
have

554
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,799
tcp dump is not a hacker tool a

555
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,600
malicious hacker tool it also means we

556
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,080
need to be able to uh

557
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,160
to talk to each other right now we're

558
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,400
not there's several countries that are

559
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,039
under sanctions that we cannot talk to

560
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,200
that's a very important thing and

561
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,360
that we say um

562
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,840
we also feel that when states make

563
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,000
decisions about what kind of con

564
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
operations they conduct they should

565
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,159
always take the good of all internet's

566
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,960
users into account so it should not be

567
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,799
the intelligence services that decide

568
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,679
hey we have a great opportunity

569
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,600
to catch some fish here

570
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,880
and we don't really care about the

571
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,000
damage it creates to the rest of society

572
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,600
it's very important for us that our

573
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,120
users are actually at the end of the day

574
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,760
safe and secure

575
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,679
we also feel very strongly that the core

576
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,679
of the internet the part the

577
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,679
infrastructure

578
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,200
deepsea cables

579
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,799
internet exchanges

580
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,720
all of this stuff should be off limits

581
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,039
they should not be part

582
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,159
of a

583
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,000
of a malicious cyberactive

584
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,919
cyber operation and should not be

585
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,840
targeted even if you could make a great

586
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,679
gain

587
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,080
and last but not least the open-ended

588
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
working group has starting has been

589
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,720
starting to emphasize

590
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,640
capacity building so all states are

591
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,120
encouraged to build capacity because

592
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,480
they've realized actually we need

593
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,880
c-suits we need security staff we don't

594
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,760
have it

595
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,919
but first says is well it's not good

596
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,919
enough to just deliver yet another

597
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,720
c-cert 101 training but rather that we

598
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
should start building up communities

599
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,559
where c-suits learn to work together

600
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,240
with all the stakeholders all stuff

601
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,559
that's really obvious to us but not so

602
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,880
obvious to states

603
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,320
and that is a position we keep on

604
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,080
reiterating

605
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,520
and i think

606
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,919
with good results at least

607
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,520
states agree to these statements all the

608
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,919
these norms i've actually shown you have

609
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,640
been agreed upon by all members of the

610
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,960
channel the u.n general assembly so in

611
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,400
principle you can say you all said yes

612
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,280
to that so aren't you sticking to this

613
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,559
they are not

614
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,320
of course there is a couple of problems

615
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,039
like attribution is one um

616
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,360
it's not really clear who plays what

617
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,360
role in attribution first view here

618
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,520
really is that c suits should stay out

619
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,760
of attribution because it kind of puts

620
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,039
us part

621
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,720
into part of a conflict attribution

622
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,320
inherently is a political process it's

623
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
one country

624
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,760
blaming another one we don't want to be

625
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,760
part of the blaming game we actually

626
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,520
want to be part of the

627
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,600
we protect our users we often compare

628
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,000
ourselves to firefighters

629
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,520
firefighters are not in the game of

630
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,679
arresting arsonists during the game of

631
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:32,799
uh

632
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,799
extinguishing fires obviously they work

633
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,480
with law enforcement to say we found

634
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,520
this kind of

635
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,360
bottle of gasoline here so maybe you

636
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,200
want to have a look at this sure we do

637
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,039
that but we're not the ones that do

638
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,039
attribution

639
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,679
it could be completely second talk about

640
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,360
attribution it's a really

641
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,200
tricky topic and if you talk to people

642
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,080
in

643
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,840
that represent states it becomes even

644
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,000
trickier

645
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,600
at the end of the day we start to kind

646
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,280
of wonder

647
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,799
at first how

648
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,480
how should all of this work together for

649
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,960
us what does this really mean and that's

650
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,919
kind of a little pr session for our own

651
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,840
code of ethics ethics first that there

652
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,880
is a signatixic at first that started

653
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,080
talking about

654
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,520
what does this do

655
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,280
it's really based on

656
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,080
the

657
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,159
fairly old universal declaration of

658
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,080
human rights

659
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,919
and what we actually feel is that what

660
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,919
we do as instance response we protect

661
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,919
users we really protect this during

662
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,320
their basic rights

663
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,559
the code of ethics is not very much into

664
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,159
human rights it just says that in one

665
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,000
sentence but what it delivers you is

666
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,720
kind of duties for example the duty to

667
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,640
reply to a request

668
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,440
duty to be trustworthy and so on and we

669
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,120
acknowledge that there is often dilemmas

670
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
because what the work we do is not

671
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,600
always easy are we gonna kind of

672
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,279
publish something a vulnerability that

673
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,520
then can be abused by someone or are we

674
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,600
gonna keep it secret just tell it to

675
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,760
some small group these are difficult

676
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,840
questions and the code of ethics

677
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,400
tries to kind of

678
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,640
give you advice on that and guidance on

679
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,559
how to find a solution that really fits

680
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,720
to you

681
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,320
that already brings me to the end of the

682
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,880
talk and i think why do i give these

683
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,960
non-technical talks while i talk about

684
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,240
this

685
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,640
it's because i really feel as much as

686
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,400
policy makers need to learn how the

687
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,320
internet works and how

688
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,159
instance responders work

689
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,559
we need to understand

690
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,919
that we're not the only ones in the

691
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,679
internet anymore that there is policy

692
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,080
makers that there is states and

693
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,559
authorities that use and abuse and

694
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,799
regulate the internet

695
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:37,600
and

696
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,360
we all together need to work on a way to

697
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,880
make internet a better place for our

698
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,840
users

699
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,080
and for mankind it's more than half the

700
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,840
population of this planet now is on the

701
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,880
internet

702
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,120
for some people

703
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,080
it uh

704
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,000
is very much on it

705
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,400
it's very much kind of their entire life

706
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,720
surrounding if you go to certain

707
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,799
nations in africa

708
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,120
the lives and the goods people own are

709
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,640
all tied to a mobile phone if that's

710
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,720
compromised we have a problem they have

711
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,159
a problem and that's what we try to

712
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,520
solve

713
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,039
that's it for my side

714
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,360
any questions

715
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,360
sorry thank you for that talk

716
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,200
this is not really a question but can

717
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,039
you elaborate a bit on

718
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,840
how do you interpret borders on the

719
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,360
internet

720
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,880
in terms that most of the infrastructure

721
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,720
is owned by private entities which are

722
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,400
then governed by

723
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,279
state entities

724
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,679
and how that falls into this

725
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,440
that is indeed a very good question and

726
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,880
and i know there's a couple of

727
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,400
international lawyers that are hard at

728
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
working trying to exactly figure this

729
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,520
about now

730
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,720
i would argue

731
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,400
the concept of

732
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,880
binary borders where two entities touch

733
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,240
on each other

734
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,200
they have

735
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,400
they're gone so when we look at at cloud

736
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,559
services we have the location of the

737
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,559
data center that potentially gives the

738
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,760
state where this data center is located

739
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,480
in

740
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,200
access to

741
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,960
[Music]

742
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,720
to all the information in that data set

743
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,559
then we have the customer who may be in

744
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,720
in a different country

745
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,640
and we have the service provider who's

746
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,320
going to be yet in another country so

747
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,960
there's at least three entities in there

748
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,120
and i think what it will have to come

749
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,360
down to is that states

750
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,520
need to start to come to agreements and

751
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,080
and how they treat this the us cloud act

752
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,480
is one attempt to do so if you study the

753
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,000
cloud it actually tells

754
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,400
says what what cloud providers or u.s

755
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,880
cloud providers are obliged to do if the

756
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,520
us government comes but it also says

757
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,360
countries are free to have specific

758
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,000
agreements with the united states to

759
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,240
change these rules a little bit

760
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,600
so i think at the end of the day sooner

761
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,960
or later we will have to come to grips

762
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,640
with how how are we going to deal with

763
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,520
this territoriality thing can we can we

764
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,279
kind of come up with internet

765
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,159
territoriality or jurisdiction but right

766
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,679
now that's an unsolved problem no one

767
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,279
really knows

768
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,600
great question

769
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,080
hey sirs uh was asn hijacking part of

770
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,880
the conversation at all

771
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,440
sorry asn hijacking so they're basically

772
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,399
hijacking by telecoms communicators of

773
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,080
uh

774
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,520
data packs was that part of the

775
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,480
conversation at all

776
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,840
i guess you it's a it's a good question

777
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,799
so i guess it's it's talking about

778
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,240
like what happened that china for

779
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,159
example started to attract certain

780
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,760
traffic to route it through its own

781
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,480
system so we can spy on it uh you can

782
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,720
have this asked a similar question is it

783
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,440
okay to actually

784
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,840
kind of listen snoop into deep sea

785
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,240
cables and uh

786
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,159
that hasn't really been part of

787
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,919
of the conversation you could argue that

788
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,159
when when people say hey you should not

789
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,520
you should leave the core of the

790
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,279
internet alone and not fiddle around

791
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,320
with this

792
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,200
that

793
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,799
should kind of be a message you

794
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,399
shouldn't really fiddle around with the

795
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,480
global routing tables

796
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,720
as for c cables it's actually totally

797
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,760
legal

798
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,440
to intercept these

799
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,320
everything outside the 200 mile zone

800
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,840
is open for grabs and you can do with

801
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,159
this stuff whatever you want to

802
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,440
so

803
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,279
that was kind of like first time i

804
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,720
talked to an international lawyer and he

805
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720
asked me is the law of the seas relevant

806
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,480
to the internet yes it is because it

807
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,600
permits you

808
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,199
to listen into deep sea cables

809
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,240
any more questions

810
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,380
thank you serge thank you for coming and
