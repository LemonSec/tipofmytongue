information security information

27
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,719
assurance program lessons learned

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,719
kenneth

29
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,159

30
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,960
how you all doing

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,400
all right so

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,320
i've been in

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,240
federal u.s federal government for about

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,040
25 years plus now doing information

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,799
security we have a little

36
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,200
programming before that so

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,119
everything i say is based on

38
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,600
in that lens so

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,159
please bear with me on that

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,600
so why why do i think i'm

41
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,880
capable of talking about this because

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,360
i in three of the organizations i have

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,720
two of them i built the information

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,119
security from the ground up

45
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,799
and one of the more important ones i

46
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,680
found

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,640
is my previous job where i helped

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,840
i was part of the federal computer

49
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,240
incident response capability then we

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,560
renamed it capable center and then

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,200
became the us cert and i helped

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,719
shepherd it from

53
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,680
the fed circle into the u.s cert which

54
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,439
is now grown into cesar which is a much

55
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,479
needed group

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,360
all right so everyone talks

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,920
about the or your organization mission

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,760
and there's been some talks

59
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,840
this week where

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,080
they mentioned mission very specifically

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,520
so you really

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,040
you really do need to understand what

63
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,599
your organization mission is

64
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,800
you need to

65
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,680
be able to figure out

66
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,599
if your public

67
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,840
government will irregardless of what

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,720
country you belong to if you're

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,800
private industry

70
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,120
art and if you're private industry are

71
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,920
you

72
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,080
in just one country

73
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,800
in a few countries are you like totally

74
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,040
global international

75
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,200
are you it's like are you in healthcare

76
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,080
are you academic research like nih yes

77
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,920
we're we're government

78
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,760
but we're also academic healthcare

79
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,040
researchers

80
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,440
so we get hit with a lot of different

81
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,640
issues

82
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,680
that are from all three areas not just

83
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,239
one area

84
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,879
and and one of the things you really

85
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,319
need to know

86
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,239
is

87
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,400
how does your information security or

88
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,480
your information insurance program

89
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,800
play in fulfilling the mission of your

90
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,239
organization

91
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,239
because that's the mindset you have to

92
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,319
think about you need to be

93
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,640
an enabler for the mission you need to

94
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,720
sell yourself as an enabler for the

95
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,640
mission because most people just think

96
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,440
oh

97
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,120
security they get in the way they won't

98
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,680
let me do what i want to do

99
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,799
so

100
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,799
so you need to be that's one thing you

101
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,599
really need to focus on is how you

102
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,319
sell yourself as enabling the mission of

103
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,119
your organization

104
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,680
and to do that you have to understand

105
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,280
the scope of one of your missions like

106
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,760
i'm at nyaya which is just one of 27

107
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,680
institutes within the national

108
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,360
institutes of health

109
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,120
and nih is just one of five or six

110
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,720
operational directives within the

111
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,720
department of health

112
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,519
and

113
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,360
human services

114
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,159
so

115
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,599
understanding where i where i i lie in

116
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,399
was very informative in helping how i

117
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,238
developed the program

118
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,639
so because i needed to know where my

119
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,600
responsibilities were and where nih's

120
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,720
responsibilities were the

121
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,560
responsibilities of some of

122
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,960
my fellow institutes were

123
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,320
so that was

124
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,240
and so like

125
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,800
do are you really are you with your

126
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,960
organization

127
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,320
are you just with one division or one

128
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,919
small part of

129
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,040
of your organization or even

130
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,360
real a really small part of the group of

131
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,800
the organization

132
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,479
so you just need to know

133
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,840
where your jurisdiction

134
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,400
resides so that uh you can actually work

135
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,599
with everybody else

136
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,280
then as always there's always a back and

137
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,280
forth about the makeup of the team is it

138
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,880
a formal team is it a virtual team or in

139
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,759
a lot of cases what it tends to be is a

140
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,440
combination of both and that was the

141
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,199
same with

142
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,639
pre-pandemic

143
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,639
even though now in the pandemic

144
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,840
everyone's virtual just by where they're

145
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
located and doing their work

146
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,560
but

147
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,720
when you talk about formal is like do

148
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,440
you have a set group of people that do

149
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,520
are doing the work or do you bring

150
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,560
people

151
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,039
in as required

152
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,840
and a lot of times that will

153
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,600
things will change over the over the

154
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,199
years as you

155
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,400
mature your operations

156
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,360
all right so

157
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,320
i try to make this not so much a reading

158
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,360
list

159
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
so there's some

160
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,600
core functions that need to

161
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,319
you need to have within your team it may

162
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,360
not

163
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,080
be

164
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,120
individuals doing these functions

165
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,479
but they could be

166
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,280
one or two individuals doing muslim some

167
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,639
of them are like

168
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,800
vulnerability configuration management

169
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,680
that may not even be part of the

170
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,080
information security program if that

171
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,520
could be part of

172
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,960
your

173
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,039
computer management program which is

174
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,520
totally could be a different part

175
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,800
like your

176
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,520
digital for instance and response

177
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,199
your privacy

178
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,680
like nih privacy is a totally separate

179
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,639
office

180
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,759
but

181
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,280
we deal with it

182
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,840
in multiple fashions with the security

183
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,479
guarding aspect as well as handling

184
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,080
privacy and dis

185
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,120
incidents

186
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,039
so that's part of why i threw it in

187
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:49,840
then

188
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,599
you have ad hoc

189
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,120
as required is like legal which i i also

190
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,599
loop in law enforcement

191
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,800
because there

192
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,680
you need to have them involved as

193
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,840
several other speakers talked about

194
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,960
human resources because you may want

195
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,080
to hand

196
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,520
you have an incident and you need to

197
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,280
handle

198
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,639
the

199
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,680
a

200
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,680
client or you need to handle an employee

201
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,960
a certain way

202
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,560
but you need to make sure you do it in

203
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,240
the legal way

204
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,599
so that's where you have the human

205
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,199
resources involved

206
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,639
and then

207
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,400
there's always going to be need to be

208
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,639
some kind of communications you need to

209
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,520
manage communications either internally

210
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,039
to

211
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,160
your

212
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,560
off cio office or

213
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,360
or

214
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,400
internally to your organization and then

215
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,199
god forbid if you really have to talk to

216
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,599
the media you want to be able to have

217
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,759
one voice who's able to talk

218
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,440
well and that's

219
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,520
usually your public relations or your

220
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,198
communications department

221
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,440
and then

222
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,280
as you're developing your team you need

223
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,759
to think about who are your customers

224
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,199
and they can your customers can just be

225
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,759
your ocio shop or they can be

226
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,440
just your small

227
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,440
organization as a whole

228
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,479
or

229
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,680
maybe you have external

230
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,599
cooperative agreements with other

231
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,039
organizations

232
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,800
they could be your customers as well

233
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
based on the relationship of it

234
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,639
and like con contractors i know in

235
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,479
with the us government we throw in

236
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,039
contracting clauses that mandate certain

237
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,360
things from an information security

238
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,559
standard

239
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,839
so

240
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,039
in that case

241
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,279
those contractors are your

242
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,680
or your customers as well

243
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,519
and then figure out like what other

244
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,440
organizations

245
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,080
you have like first is a great example

246
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,959
of

247
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,640
an organization

248
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,800
it's uh in the u.s we have all these the

249
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,040
different ice acts where uh health care

250
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,680
is like financial banking real estate

251
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,040
isaac there's the multi-state ice ac

252
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,160
and and when your cert

253
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,839
was first set up there was uh trying to

254
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,040
figure out where we're going to be the

255
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,720
federal isaac

256
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,640
so those are some of the things you need

257
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,720
to unders

258
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,839
talk about

259
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,480
now

260
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,040
we always we all don't want to

261
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,240
be

262
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,560
worried about politics

263
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,760
but the fact of the matter is

264
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,080
politics always takes the place

265
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,000
because you always know that there's

266
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,800
somebody who has

267
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,760
the voice of

268
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,560
the ceo or the director of your

269
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,240
organization

270
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,279
or someone else it could be just like it

271
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,640
could be

272
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,680
the ceo's secretary or it could be

273
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,800
the the

274
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,880
one in my in

275
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,079
my organization we have all these

276
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,680
vip

277
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,959
direct

278
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,440
associate directors for different uh

279
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,720
labs

280
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,120
and those are the cases where it's like

281
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,480
we need to

282
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,480
be

283
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,079
aware of what

284
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,040
how what we do affects their labs

285
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,600
because if they don't like it then they

286
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,040
complain to

287
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,320
my boss

288
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,959
and i do and when my boss comes to me

289
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,120
and says so-and-so is not happy with you

290
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,600
it's not a good thing

291
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,680
so you need to you need to know you need

292
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,920
to be able to get those folks on your

293
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,360
side work with them

294
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,680
and and like i said some some

295
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,519
organization some it could be the

296
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,120
smallest lab

297
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,760
but or the smallest division in your

298
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,240
company but if they're the ones that

299
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,320
bring in most of the money you think

300
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,920
they're gonna have a lot of clout so you

301
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,839
need to

302
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,880
understand how

303
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,079
who

304
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,399
there are those relationships so that

305
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,680
you can

306
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,519
make sure that you deal with

307
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,240
understanding folks and

308
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,640
prioritizing what you need to do in a

309
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,640
way that you fulfill your mission

310
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,880
so

311
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,000
regulatory

312
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,680
compliance requirements

313
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,200
we all have them

314
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,079
and it

315
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,640
this is just a list of ones that i know

316
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,040
about and or or someone gave me a link

317
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,920
to

318
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,000
to try to help me make this a little bit

319
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,600
more broader

320
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,279
like

321
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,760
unfortunately when when i was doing

322
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,519
reviewing my health

323
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,920
healthcare information security and

324
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,079
privacy practitioner handbook

325
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,560
i can only really find the three us

326
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,000
codes i and i'm sure i know eu has codes

327
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,920
i'm not sure about some of the other

328
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,120
other requirements so if so

329
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,079
you think about that uh financial

330
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,440
like sarbanes-oxley which is a u.s

331
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,120
code

332
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,760
code and then the the payment card

333
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,320
standards which is international those

334
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,560
are issues you need to do

335
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,880
every every country has some kind of

336
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,160
privacy uh data data whether it be like

337
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,120
in the us the privacy act of 1974 and

338
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,399
there's unlike chronic one night not

339
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:24,639
1993 i think is the year for that one

340
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,200
order or you use uh

341
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,839
general data protection regulation

342
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,120
those are

343
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,040
you need to know what privacy

344
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,240
requirements you have in your or country

345
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,360
or your countries if you work up

346
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,320
in multiple ones

347
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,160
then like

348
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,279
the u.s government we have

349
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,760
fisma as we call it the modernization

350
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
act of 2014 which

351
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,079
which was good for helping

352
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,120
puts

353
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,560
cisa in as a high level or

354
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,959
recently i learned about and this is

355
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,800
some of their directives for the eu yeah

356
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,519
the

357
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,399
nisd and the cyber security act

358
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,120
and

359
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,880
and if you haven't had a chance to go

360
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,399
down to this booth i would recommend you

361
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,079
do so you can talk to them because even

362
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,160
though you may not be in

363
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,120
pot

364
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,360
be required to follow them

365
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
it's a good idea to learn what other

366
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,680
other things are so it can help you with

367
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,079
your development of your programs even

368
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,839
if you don't need to comply with them

369
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,160
so what are your dependencies

370
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,079
like in like my

371
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,240
my tier one and some responders they're

372
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,639
the customer support

373
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,920
technicians

374
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,560
you get the guys that go in to help the

375
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,600
people who updating their

376
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,839
microsoft office if they have other

377
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,560
issues with their workstations

378
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,440
and

379
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,240
they don't not only help us with our in

380
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,480
handling our secure information security

381
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,519
incidents

382
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,279
when we have vulnerabilities on desktops

383
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,680
and laptops that we can't

384
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,959
fix

385
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,880
through a global push

386
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,040
they're the ones that go and

387
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,959
fix those uh

388
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,760
desktops and laptops so they're a very

389
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,120
big thing

390
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,440
it's like if if you have to work with

391
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
your server team because a lot of times

392
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,880
they're the ones that deal with

393
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,120
managing the vulnerabilities on your

394
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,959
servers or making sure that your servers

395
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,639
logs are going there

396
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,680
in my organization we have a

397
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,600
cyber engineering

398
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,760
cyber security engineering team which

399
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,680
handles

400
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,800
our sim

401
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,440
our routers our firewalls

402
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,720
our anti

403
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,600
anti-malware applications so those are

404
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,639
dependencies i have

405
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,440
do

406
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,720
as i have you

407
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,839
contracted out to an

408
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,440
mssp to do some of your work

409
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,760
that's a dependency

410
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,199
do you have to uh bring in another con

411
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,959
company and to do your forensics because

412
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,079
you don't have that in-house capability

413
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,320
and at nih most of the most of the

414
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,959
institutes aren't large enough that they

415
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:15,839
can

416
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,680
afford to do it so they have to hope for

417
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,040
nih's information security program to do

418
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,360
the digital forensics program i luckily

419
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,600
was enough and had to support my boss

420
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,519
that i was able to bring that

421
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,600
capability in-house so that i didn't

422
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,639
have to depend on them

423
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,440
and then it's like are there other parts

424
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,079
of your organization that you rely on

425
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,600
that you that you don't manage

426
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,759
those are dependencies and you need to

427
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,480
know that you need to know who you're

428
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,519
responsible for

429
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,839
yeah

430
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,240
so we all know it's like

431
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,839
most of us know the incident response is

432
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,040
reactive

433
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,040
but i always like to think of how can i

434
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,160
be proactive first

435
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,000
security audits

436
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,199
yes they are a pain

437
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,600
they take time

438
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,120
the people that you have to deal with

439
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,079
said why are you bothering me with me

440
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,839
they are snapch

441
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,680
the way they used to be done

442
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,199
they are a snapshot in time

443
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,560
but

444
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,720
what it is is if you know

445
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,639
how your systems are

446
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,519
how they're set up how they're managed

447
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,240
do they have an incident response

448
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,880
plan for the for that particular system

449
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,720
do you have a configuration management

450
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,120
plan for that system do you have

451
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,480
a disaster recovery plan for that system

452
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,519
then

453
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,079
then in worst case scenarios you know

454
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,199
you are ready and

455
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,440
the way things are being at least within

456
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,120
the u.s government and the national

457
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,320
institutes for standards and

458
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
technologies they are

459
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
making things where it's not so much the

460
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,440
time that the time stamp it's we're

461
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,959
looking at doing these ongoing

462
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,760
authorizations where it's like yes you

463
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,160
do your reviews of uh

464
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,880
these uh controls

465
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,119
and that is one standpoint and then you

466
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,359
do a third of them every year

467
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,559
but it's also part of you keeping like

468
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,039
looking at how the systems can work

469
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,520
being configured and managed over time

470
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,079
do you make and you manage it are they

471
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,000
fixing your vulnerabilities

472
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,640
in a timely manner are they making

473
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,120
changes and updating their documentation

474
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,600
in a timely manner those are

475
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,320
things that help us out

476
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,120
oh

477
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,200
yeah vulnerability and configuration

478
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,240
management

479
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,280
yeah those are those are very much

480
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,760
if you can stop things from being

481
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,200
unsecure

482
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,320
then

483
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,480
at the get-go then you don't have to do

484
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,720
it uh let's say in the us we have uh

485
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,440
cesar bod 2201

486
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,080
where they are constantly giving us

487
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,600
every

488
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,840
couple of days a new list of

489
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,720
vulnerabilities that we need to fix

490
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,000
yes it's it takes up a lot of time but

491
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,840
it keeps us on our toes and make tries

492
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,200
to make sure that our at least our

493
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,280
public-facing systems

494
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,799
are as secure as possible

495
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,720
penetration testing

496
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,120
that's to me that's just components that

497
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,440
means you get someone else to look at

498
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,360
you and see

499
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,559
where you where you may have issues

500
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,480
with your systems

501
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,720
and so then you can fix them before the

502
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,840
bad guys get to them

503
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,080
they are time consuming they can be

504
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,679
expensive

505
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,000
if you do if you do it right

506
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,679
but they are very helpful

507
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,280
then threat intelligence there's been

508
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,720
several uh

509
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,880
sessions on threat intelligence from the

510
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,640
proactive side

511
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,280
current intelligence is okay

512
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,480
i am in

513
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,400
these various sectors

514
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,280
so

515
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,120
who is looking

516
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,960
at these sectors

517
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,280
for whatever reason is it for financial

518
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,400
gain

519
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,160
is it for

520
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,240
espionage

521
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,520
is it for

522
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,960
activism

523
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,000
so you

524
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,919
so the threat intelligence votes can

525
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,080
help you with that and

526
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,200
make sure that you have an idea of who

527
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,919
you

528
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,120
might be targeting you

529
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,520
now on the reactive side

530
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,600
okay again let's start since i just

531
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,960
talked about the intelligence on the

532
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,799
proactive side let's talk about it on

533
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,360
the reactor side

534
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,760
we all know through intelligence threat

535
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,679
hunting you don't

536
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,720
you go in and look to see okay

537
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,960
we had this incident

538
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,440
let's do a little bit more detail

539
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,440
look at what what happened and see if we

540
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,080
missed anything or maybe

541
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,520
you're just

542
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
you you look you have somebody looking

543
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,280
at the

544
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,840
logs and

545
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,480
your intelligence guy will take it and

546
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,240
just start going going through a whole

547
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,559
deep dive where your standard network

548
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,039
security folks don't have that

549
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,880
time

550
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,360
so you look so they they can look and

551
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,440
see what's happened in the past to try

552
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,080
to protect you and help

553
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,360
prevent things from the beginning then

554
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,400
network security all right

555
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,799
you see you you're looking at your locks

556
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,320
you see something anomalous

557
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,200
is it

558
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,640
is it an event

559
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,640
yes is it an incident

560
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,840
well let's go look and see

561
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,320
it's an event okay

562
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,200
i gotta

563
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,880
respond to it so now i have insulin

564
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,240
response

565
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,240
and we're and you're handling it and as

566
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,760
part of the insulin response it's like

567
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,919
oh okay i need to see what happened on

568
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,520
that machine

569
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,760
so now i so now i have my digital

570
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,039
forensics folks come in and do the deep

571
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,280
dive and looking at a machine or

572
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,678
whatever to see what really happened

573
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,000
so

574
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,919
so i love

575
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,080
i would love to stay away from reactive

576
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,640
um and try to stay club more on the

577
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,480
proactive side

578
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,440
and

579
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,440
but at the end of the day we're not

580
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,320
going to be able to protect everything

581
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,720
and so it'll prevent everything so we're

582
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,320
always going to have some form of

583
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,640
reactive and the better you are at being

584
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,200
reactive and capturing things in a

585
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,440
shorter amount of time

586
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,520
then the least damage can be done to

587
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,080
your system

588
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,640
so before i go into questions i'm just

589
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,200
going to flap up my contact information

590
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,360
all right

591
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,520
so do we have any questions

592
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,559
all right

593
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,679
jeff

594
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:00,880
thanks ken

595
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,200
um i was wondering if you're able to uh

596
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,679
obviously you work in an organization

597
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,240
that uh has been very important over the

598
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,640
past couple of years so i was interested

599
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,760
if you

600
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,120
if you're able to

601
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
comment on some of the different

602
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,679
challenges that you faced

603
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,400
being an information security person

604
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,520
in a

605
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,080
government health organization during a

606
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,760
pandemic i'm sure that presented some

607
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,360
special challenges if you have anything

608
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,799
to share i think people would be

609
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,559
interested in hearing

610
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,039
well i guess one of the key things is

611
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,600
for those who are not american

612
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,039
citizens

613
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,400
dr anthony falci is the head of the

614
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,760
national institute of algae and

615
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,440
infectious diseases

616
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,799
and during our previous president's

617
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,320
reign

618
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,720
he was quite vocal in

619
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,120
downplaying what the president was

620
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,360
saying and telling the truth the

621
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,840
unvarnished truth

622
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,480
so that made him

623
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,960
a lot of enemies in

624
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,960
the president's cutery

625
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,159
and in his uh

626
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,840
cult-like following

627
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,240
and this is my personal opinion so

628
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,440
and so please don't uh say is anything

629
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,799
government

630
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:19,919
so

631
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,320
when we first learn about some of the

632
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,760
harassment that dr falchi and

633
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,120
his family was

634
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,799
were receiving

635
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,919
we had to figure out what can we do to

636
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,960
assist them well some my immediate gut

637
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,919
reaction was we need to get the

638
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,679
inspector general

639
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,799
involved

640
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,960
the hhs inspector general

641
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,000
for

642
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,640
and inspector generals

643
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
and the u.s government have multiple

644
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,880
jobs some of them some of them are they

645
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,760
are the

646
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,400
the overall auditors of the system but

647
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,200
they are also the police force

648
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,120
for the government

649
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,799
they'll they'll come in and handle

650
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,120
things and then bring bring in the

651
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,200
secret service or bring in the fbi if

652
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,720
necessary

653
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,760
so that was some of the stuff and then

654
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,000
some of the other stuff is we had is

655
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,039
like

656
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,279
one thing that president trump did do

657
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,679
correctly is establish operation warp

658
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,120
suite which is

659
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,640
made it

660
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,120
monetarily feasible for the

661
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,679
drug companies to

662
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:26,640
work

663
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,760
to develop

664
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,840
the vaccine in a more

665
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,240
quick manner then it is make it

666
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,480
worthwhile for them to

667
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,559
before they got got approval from the

668
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,799
fda to start developing and

669
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,919
manufacturing the vaccine so

670
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,799
we had multiple applications out there

671
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,360
which were to provide people with

672
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,279
access to information for how to treat

673
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,400
people with covate or how to enroll into

674
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,600
vaccine

675
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,960
trials

676
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,039
so i had to make sure that those systems

677
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,440
were secure and as best as possible

678
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,760
then other than just making sure that

679
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,960
ours

680
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,840
manage

681
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,919
our financial systems that them

682
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,799
throughout grants and contracts to

683
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,200
companies that were doing research on

684
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,760
kobe the uh as well as some of the other

685
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,840
stuff like ebola

686
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,679
and

687
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,000
honda and all that

688
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,840
those were just some of the other issues

689
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,039
hello thank you for your presentation

690
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,679
um i wanted to ask you a question

691
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,200
you've been around some time and you've

692
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
seen the progress of things and you've

693
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,679
seen how such teams develop and maybe

694
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,440
you can anticipate a little bit

695
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,880
of the future

696
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,480
i wanted to ask something in particular

697
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,600
with the use of legal services

698
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,679
and i'm part of an organization where we

699
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,279
see that the

700
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,520
the legal office is not

701
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,679
a remote thing that only comes in when

702
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,919
we have to deal with law enforcement but

703
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,440
they're getting more and more involved

704
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,080
into daily operations we often find

705
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,159
ourselves in situations where we need to

706
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,720
decide about security risk

707
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,679
by resorting to to legal reasoning and

708
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,080
they become part of the team more and

709
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,640
more so i just wanted to

710
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,200
ask whether you have a view of whether

711
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,400
legal instead of an ad hoc thing

712
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,799
turns

713
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,320
may become part of the core

714
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
operations let's say maybe not the core

715
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,200
but

716
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,840
being at least

717
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,600
i would there's like

718
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,440
there's an answer to it that people

719
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,360
don't like and that's it depends and i

720
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,760
haven't had to do they're very legal

721
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,799
yeah i haven't had to do do where legal

722
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,640
is really involved much except for when

723
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,440
i'm

724
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,600
reviewing contracts

725
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,440
prior to them

726
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,360
prior to the selection petitions going

727
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,559
out to ensure that we have the

728
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,520
fisma clauses put into those contracts

729
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,360
but

730
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,400
i look i look that is is like having

731
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,159
your account is

732
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,000
set up in a relationship with your

733
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,200
counsel

734
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,240
your general counsel and

735
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,360
with

736
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,440
like in my case i have

737
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,159
good relationships with the ig because

738
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,679
they've come to me

739
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,480
for my assistance on issues

740
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,440
and i've had to go to them

741
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,760
when i when we accidentally discover

742
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,399
something it's like

743
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,360
uh

744
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,080
i think this is uh

745
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,240
questionability

746
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,720
so i throw it to them to look at and say

747
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,159
is this a

748
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,840
did they did this person actually create

749
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,559
a crime or is he just

750
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,039
abusing government equipment

751
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,039
so

752
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,120
i i'm sorry i can't give you a direct

753
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,279
answer but i i would say it really

754
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,039
depends on how your organization is set

755
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,440
up and and it may it may

756
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,399
fit your organization to have legal

757
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,440
fully

758
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,720
embedded

759
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,000
it as a dashed line in your system so

760
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,039
that they're involved in everything

761
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,880
