lunch

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,839
um

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,840
vanoss recently joined city's cyber

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,400
intelligence center um actually before i

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,680
get into that pardon me i'm going to

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,800
remind you

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,599
we've got tlp white er or under the new

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,279
system to be clear

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,320
so you can post this on social media uh

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,679
there's going to be time for questions

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,840
and answers at the end questions can be

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,760
asked at the microphones at the front or

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,480
in the the center

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,800
please don't forget to do the surveys

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,360
when you're done with this

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,000
silence your devices and finally as i

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,480
said jab vanos recently joined city

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,160
cyber intelligence center

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,120
um the cyber intelligence lead for

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,239
emeks

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,840
you can read his profile on his long

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,760
work in cyber crime or actually against

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,760
cybercrime

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,559
yep

28
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,320
the floor is yours

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,120
thank you very much

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,159
so hello everybody

31
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,439
how are you liking the conference so far

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,520
is it good

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,000
for me i i think it's excellent to be

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,920
here and it's an honor it's my first

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,240
time first time speaking first time

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,520
first

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,960
and um

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,280
and what i noted these

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,600
this last couple of days are a couple of

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,920
buzzwords i don't know if you recognize

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,240
them but there was a lot of talk about

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,400
ecosystems

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,200
cybercrime ecosystems ransomware

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,040
ecosystems

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,280
all kinds of ecosystems

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,040
and there was another one

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,040
a ransomware

48
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,600
obvious one i suppose i hope you all

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,960
recognize that

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,200
and there's one um

51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,079
and even a little bit more obvious it

52
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,280
was sharing we need to share we need to

53
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,840
rally and share we need to collaborate

54
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,000
and the sharing is not new in this

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,040
community i know that for sure but i

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,439
just want to speak a little bit about

57
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,038
how we

58
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,480
do and see information sharing and why

59
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,040
it's important to uh to us

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,959
and uh yes i'm um i'm yam fanus i'm

61
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,319
i'm dutch

62
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,640
and you can see that so i

63
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,840
i had my i dropped i crashed with my

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,720
bicycle last saturday you can still see

65
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,319
the bruises there so yeah really dutch

66
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,920
there was no alcohol involved there was

67
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,760
also no helmet

68
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,920
which is a pity

69
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,000
nevertheless

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,319
i come from quite a long law enforcement

71
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,519
career spend it always in cyber

72
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,800
and

73
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,280
now i jumped to what we call the dark

74
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,000
side or what my former colleagues would

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,920
call the dark side and i started to work

76
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,200
for cities

77
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,440
cyber intelligence center

78
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,120
um

79
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,680
completely different or but i still look

80
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,000
at the same modus operandi the same

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,920
groups the same things my job is to to

82
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,000
collect

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,239
intelligence but also to share out

84
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,640
intelligence and to finally and

85
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,640
hopefully this will also result from

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,000
this talk to to engage

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,400
that's my job

88
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,040
so okay

89
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,519
um sharing threat intelligence and

90
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,920
information analysis

91
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,080
and insight

92
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,120
is basically

93
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,599
the thing we use to collaborate with our

94
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,760
peers

95
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,879
face basically the same threats

96
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,040
and

97
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,799
sharing intelligence is also key aspect

98
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,280
of a dynamic intelligence and data

99
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,560
driven cyber security strategy or

100
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,159
posture

101
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,400
and

102
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,480
and we do this intelligence sharing with

103
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,200
repair financial institutions

104
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,959
but also with other involved

105
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,478
stakeholders

106
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,600
and that why we do that is to prevent to

107
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,918
detect and to respond

108
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,720
to cyber incidents and threats

109
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,280
and that way we try to strengthen our

110
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,199
joint defenses

111
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,680
and we strengthen the broader financial

112
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,919
or the cyber ecosystems in our case

113
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,040
however

114
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,759
that said

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,720
many organizations firmly support

116
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,360
intelligence sharing and individuals

117
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
like you too

118
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,320
and we aspire to become good citizens

119
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,440
and actively share with others

120
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,199
and are often

121
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,479
internal and organizational barriers

122
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,199
hurdles to take that limit our

123
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,160
information sharing

124
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,039
and very few organizations achieve an

125
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,360
effective and efficient level and

126
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,240
consistency of sharing and collaboration

127
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,720
that way and that

128
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,080
we argued

129
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,400
is limiting the amount of valuable

130
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,880
insight being shared directly between

131
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,080
peers

132
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,560
and via existing sharing groups and

133
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,479
communities and in turn this is slowing

134
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,880
the development of cross-sector

135
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,440
multi-agency

136
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,080
multi-disciplinary

137
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,639
collaboration and that i think was one

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,759
of the key

139
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,360
items also

140
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,880
that

141
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,800
public private cooperation

142
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,240
multi-disciplinary cooperation and

143
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,479
facilitated by information share

144
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,960
and and in city we have

145
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,199
a partnership and engagement team

146
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,880
where i'm part of

147
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,319
and we actually made an effort

148
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,720
to examine and address these internal

149
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,759
barriers and to create a program

150
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,360
to create policies to create processes

151
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,680
to facilitate efficient

152
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,000
safe and scalable

153
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,039
and actionable intelligence

154
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,000
and also that all with legal and

155
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,840
regulatory and supervisory overview

156
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,520
and that means that

157
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,440
we do not have to go

158
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,520
to legal before we share

159
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
out something and they would probably

160
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,639
say no

161
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,880
now we can make our own decision

162
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,360
within this framework to share out

163
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,560
so that's basically

164
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,680
where we were at

165
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,800
okay um the the title who shares wins

166
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,080
um

167
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,880
who shares this is a derivation of who

168
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,280
dares wins and who dares wins is the

169
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,479
motto

170
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,919
that sir david sterling gave to the ses

171
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,520
the special air

172
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,880
services

173
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,599
you know and that's a group of men

174
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,360
a small group of men that fight the many

175
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,120
and we found that motto um so

176
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,400
interesting positive active

177
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,759
entertaining

178
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,240
that we said okay let's call that

179
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,919
program who

180
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,039
shares wins with the same

181
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,479
positive and interesting and memorable

182
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,880
connotation as the who dares wins

183
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,680
and

184
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,759
of course that name is succinct it's

185
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,039
memorable you know you associate with it

186
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,919
and it's also positive and dynamic and

187
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,560
it shows success

188
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,800
and that's what we want to achieve with

189
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,759
this

190
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,680
information sharing we want to have

191
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,160
success we want to action

192
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,840
the intelligence that we share

193
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,560
and

194
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,520
it is also somehow

195
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,280
challenging us

196
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,360
to make it work

197
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,879
so that's how we

198
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,840
got around to that

199
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,840
a little bit of the

200
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,400
background

201
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,639
in city we are strong advocates of

202
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,319
collaboration and and

203
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,759
and information sharing

204
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,559
maybe not as much as we should do we are

205
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,240
on the right direction and i think also

206
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,399
our senior leadership are strong

207
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,599
advocates

208
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,719
of

209
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,560
collaboration

210
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,399
but nevertheless it isn't always easy to

211
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,000
bring that into practice

212
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,560
and we all know that sharing helps to

213
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,279
prevent detect response to cyber threats

214
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,120
cyber events and

215
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,640
things like that

216
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,920
so we should

217
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,279
do it

218
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,920
because it helps us to strengthen our

219
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,519
defenses

220
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,600
and if you have

221
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,800
you know

222
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,000
a dynamic cyber information security

223
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,040
strategy and system and program

224
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,440
sharing should be part of that

225
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,240
because in the end it will lead to a

226
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,040
more resilient in our case financial

227
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,160
ecosystem but it probably will help the

228
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,720
whole cyber ecosystem

229
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
too

230
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,080
that is the background

231
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,600
where we started

232
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,399
working from

233
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,519
so

234
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,519
the challenge is

235
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,279
um we had a pretty good resource

236
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,839
partner in the ship and engagement

237
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,399
team and we actually

238
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,640
already shared out successfully with our

239
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,440
peers and partners

240
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,760
intelligence and collected that even

241
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,240
before we had this program because a lot

242
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,240
of the information that we share is

243
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,399
informally shared and you know when when

244
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,959
things get rough and are incidents you

245
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,399
start

246
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,480
communicating with your peers and

247
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,920
hopefully also

248
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,720
in between the csr teams and in between

249
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,959
the banks and with law enforcement and

250
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,880
you will do that but a lot of it is

251
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,160
informal and that means that it's not

252
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,480
always actionable

253
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,920
in that case

254
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,720
so there's a big

255
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,839
challenge

256
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,959
nevertheless we knew it was successful

257
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,199
and

258
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,920
it was making a possible contribution

259
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,240
also to the posture of our

260
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,399
organization of our bank

261
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,320
nevertheless there were still these

262
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,720
these limiting

263
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,440
factors and barriers and we we were

264
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,839
actually lacking an approved and

265
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,880
documented internal policy

266
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,120
or process

267
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,000
there was no agreement in place with our

268
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,720
lawyers and

269
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,519
no

270
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,320
fully auditable way of the information

271
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,839
that we shared

272
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,920
and that was where we found the

273
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,600
challenge to make

274
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,959
that system

275
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,640
somehow

276
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,279
to formalize it in a way so that we

277
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,399
could use it that it was agreed that we

278
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,120
could also track what we were sharing

279
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,279
and

280
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,000
just also to give you

281
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,839
an example

282
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,519
in somewhere i think april or so maybe

283
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,880
even earlier

284
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,440
last year we started to to track cobalt

285
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,440
strike

286
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,839
beacons or endpoints

287
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,079
and

288
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,680
we did that uh quite good and i think

289
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,680
also some other peers would do that and

290
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,920
every time we would um of course we

291
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,800
would

292
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,519
at first uh start tracking them because

293
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,320
we wanted to see if we had owned

294
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,040
beacons or instances in our networks in

295
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,480
our systems

296
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,519
and then

297
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,120
we started

298
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,920
working on the communication of those

299
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,320
cobot strike beacons

300
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,079
to find out where

301
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:22,839
the

302
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,000
c2s were hosted and located

303
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,040
and we

304
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,000
did that regularly and then we started

305
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,040
to build you know lists with new cobot

306
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,079
strike

307
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,760
instances and new c2s and we started

308
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,399
sharing that with the

309
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,160
community

310
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,079
just for it's a simple

311
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,279
simple

312
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,440
example nevertheless

313
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,639
it is

314
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,959
it was worthwhile

315
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,680
to do that it gave better insight in how

316
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,959
this infrastructure was used and how

317
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,160
peers and other collaborators were being

318
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,279
targeted by this

319
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,680
similar we did something with the beef

320
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,120
eater command and control beefeater is

321
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,399
you know

322
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,120
from

323
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,279
originates

324
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,040
from the

325
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,000
democratic people's republic of korea so

326
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,800
it's a completely different

327
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,399
group

328
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,480
but also there we started

329
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,200
and

330
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,680
and that group is of particular

331
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,639
importance to us because it's hitting

332
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,680
financial infrastructure

333
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,519
not just directly but financial

334
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,760
infrastructure so if you're a cyber

335
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,199
intelligence person there you

336
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,000
take note of those kind of developments

337
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,680
and we started

338
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,040
building a picture of these c2s that

339
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,800
were being used

340
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,680
again also mapping out bits and pieces

341
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,800
of infrastructure

342
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,760
and then

343
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,000
another example a little bit different

344
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,360
but you know when rival used that zero

345
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,040
day to compromise the cassaya vsa

346
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,399
instances

347
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,079
we started tracking

348
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,120
um

349
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,680
those casses industries who were open to

350
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,439
the internet and could probably be

351
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,839
compromised

352
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,639
meaning and started to share out that

353
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,040
information with

354
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,560
with others

355
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,760
these are all examples and you know of

356
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,360
work that is

357
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,079
uh

358
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,519
to do so

359
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,240
why i'm saying this is that if we really

360
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,000
want to disrupt

361
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,760
cyber criminal or other infrastructure

362
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,480
we should share what we see on our

363
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,000
networks and that way in a common effort

364
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,720
try to map out the infrastructure and to

365
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,760
see where we can

366
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,000
interrupt where we can intervene

367
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,240
okay the program itself because i also

368
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,639
want to tell you what we actually

369
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,420
did how this program looked like and

370
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,959
[Music]

371
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,760
at first we were starting to see okay we

372
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,839
were just you know getting all the white

373
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,440
papers and all the framework on

374
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,519
information sharing together and started

375
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,399
to think of how that framework would fit

376
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,120
in our organization then we started

377
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,320
identifying the data sets

378
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,279
that might be of interest or the

379
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,519
pieces of internal intelligence that

380
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,120
might be of interest

381
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,720
to you too

382
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,800
so we identified that and then we

383
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,279
started to identify

384
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,759
potential partners to share it

385
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,079
of course first pair financial

386
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,360
institutes

387
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,519
but soon after also

388
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,480
organizations like the ncsc here in

389
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,079
ireland or in the uk or in the

390
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,240
netherlands

391
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,759
a cert cert community always important

392
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,880
also law enforcement so it's not only

393
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,040
about the financial sector we want to

394
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,639
work with whomever

395
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,440
is

396
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,199
involved

397
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,480
and then we

398
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,880
basically so we have we had the content

399
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,279
we had what we wanted to share and then

400
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,680
we just were looking we had the audience

401
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,680
and then we were just you know we should

402
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,360
have controls

403
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,600
and so we started looking at which

404
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,079
controls we had so we designed what we

405
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,279
call a make a checker program

406
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,639
so we derive intelligence internally

407
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,120
and the maker will look at the

408
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
intelligence will

409
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,240
assess if it's useful and then it will

410
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,920
basically put it in to our process and

411
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
it will be

412
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,120
as a potential share to whomever

413
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,120
and then there's the second person

414
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,160
colleague who is the the viewer and he

415
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,920
will review

416
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,800
that

417
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,560
sharing out

418
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,640
that share that's already there so

419
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,640
you've got the four eyes principle so

420
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,319
whatever goes out

421
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,919
is good

422
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,720
it's useful but it's also something that

423
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,199
wouldn't cause too many troubles

424
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,280
internally

425
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,199
and then um

426
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,839
then you think you know but if you want

427
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,679
to share intelligence you have to be

428
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,640
quick and make a checker process

429
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,559
that takes time of course it takes time

430
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,440
but not that long and we even have a

431
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,080
quick share process that we can that we

432
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,919
can you know with those kinds of

433
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,160
information that are

434
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,080
valuable and quick to share we can do

435
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,520
that

436
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,520
within half an hour

437
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,520
and if that doesn't work we can always

438
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,440
fall back to the old

439
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,760
information sharing principle and that's

440
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,360
our informal

441
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,639
networks we use

442
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,559
so what we then have is this

443
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,520
this process this framework and

444
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,080
who shares means is also positive

445
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,720
it also we felt good that we had it and

446
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,840
we use it a lot it is a bit clunky but

447
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,799
uh it's a concept that works

448
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,440
i will come back to that later

449
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,160
another example

450
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,039
i have to take care of the time uh

451
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,280
conti everybody knows about conti the

452
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,280
conti leaks

453
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
everybody knows probably that there is

454
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,960
the 10 million

455
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,400
reward

456
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,440
for identifying key players by the state

457
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,280
department there and you can earn

458
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,080
another 5 million if you

459
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,960
identify conspirators somewhere else

460
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,520
uh in the world

461
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,919
and we also know that they attacked uh

462
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,600
costa rica

463
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,760
and before that to give it also a bit

464
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,840
cooler locale um 40 may 20

465
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,200
21 the the irish health services here

466
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,919
were attacked by by county and that was

467
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,000
of course an awful

468
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,720
uh attack and 80 percent of their

469
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,280
infrastructure was contaminated and

470
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,880
it meant that a lot of those health

471
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,440
services weren't working at that point

472
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,039
in time

473
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,400
and which is

474
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,640
of course a very

475
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,440
dreadful attack

476
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,720
and now

477
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,960
why do i tell you all this because this

478
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,360
is all ocean this is all things we can

479
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,480
find

480
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,640
anywhere else and it probably gives a

481
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,000
good point for

482
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,840
the cyber crime atlas their oceans

483
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,200
vision of ocean analysis

484
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,600
nevertheless i tell you this because

485
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,799
this group

486
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,240
oh i i was sorry man i i screwed up a

487
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,640
little bit

488
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,080
what we see last year uh what we see in

489
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,480
april was socially airing campaigns

490
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,760
towards

491
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,799
our staff across multi-agencies and

492
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,200
there was bizarre call

493
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,480
campaigns

494
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,799
and after a bit of work we could link

495
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,520
them to wizard spider visit pira is

496
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,559
conti

497
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,640
and then

498
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,440
that is why country was of interest to

499
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,520
us because it was targeting our

500
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,640
periphery so the combination of osint

501
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,200
and what we found on our in our lux on

502
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,080
our perimeter gave us insight and i

503
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,280
think

504
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,480
and if that insight would help others

505
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,960
then we will share it out

506
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,280
that's why these groups

507
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,960
that's why this is an important

508
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,720
example

509
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,919
and

510
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,559
then subsequently we see after these

511
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,039
bizarre call campaigns with

512
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,320
changing ttps and iocs all the time we

513
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,600
see

514
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,480
the bizarre the black basta

515
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,880
ransomware targeting

516
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,919
our

517
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:10,720
uh

518
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,240
prohibitory

519
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
and and based on

520
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,120
the

521
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,159
the design of the league site but also

522
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,080
the way they support

523
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,600
their victims

524
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,880
and the timing of their data leaks

525
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,520
blockbuster could be you know linked to

526
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,480
conti also so this is an interesting

527
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,520
group or this is an interesting topic so

528
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,880
what we see

529
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,960
we will share out to the larger

530
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,520
community to make sure that we have the

531
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,280
best information

532
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,960
position possible

533
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,440
to go after these guys that's the goal

534
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,919
so what does it all result

535
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:04,640
to

536
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,679
well basically we have a process

537
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,240
with the appropriate controls for

538
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,960
sharing information and intelligence and

539
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,840
as said not only with our peers in the

540
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,039
financial industry but with certs

541
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,440
uh with the third community but with law

542
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,480
enforcement but when everybody who might

543
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,400
be at stake here

544
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,600
and that is i think very powerful

545
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,240
we see an increase in our quality of the

546
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,799
information that we share out and also

547
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,400
the quantity actually and we are able to

548
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,280
track it and trace it we know exactly

549
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,919
what we have shared with whom

550
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,760
we also know what feedback we got if we

551
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,159
got feedback

552
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,919
we have a better understanding

553
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,600
internally about our cyber threat intel

554
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,720
function

555
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,520
and how it interacts with other

556
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,799
information owners in the bank

557
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,480
and it makes a significant contribution

558
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,679
to city cyber security posture having

559
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,520
this program in place and most of all we

560
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,000
feel like we are doing the right thing

561
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,039
like we are good citizens we not only

562
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,760
talk about sharing but we also share

563
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,000
and

564
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,520
then

565
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,400
to finalize

566
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,440
what we also have is and i think more of

567
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,000
you will have that but we we have our

568
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,480
top 10 threat actors

569
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,679
and

570
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,520
it's an exercise we do regularly to see

571
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,440
which groups

572
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,200
might be nation state groups might be

573
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,440
criminal groups on targeting our bank

574
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,960
and

575
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,919
that way we somehow you know

576
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,440
can set our priorities as you wish

577
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,400
and

578
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,200
what we see there lately is that

579
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,080
these actors are very advanced and they

580
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,440
use

581
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,760
and cloud competent and some of them are

582
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,080
even targeting cloud services only

583
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,240
we see the supply chain

584
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,360
being targeted more and more

585
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,320
and we also see that they abuse the

586
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,919
continuous integration and development

587
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,679
system

588
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,240
so those are trends that we see

589
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,400
and how do we measure them we we look at

590
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,559
capability and intent

591
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,760
and then we do this exercise every

592
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,559
so often to make this top 10 threat

593
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,039
actors and of course

594
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,279
you can say that in the top

595
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,720
there might be

596
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,080
apts

597
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,200
with the china origin

598
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,919
or with any other

599
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,080
native state origin but there are also

600
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,559
criminal

601
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,919
uh criminal actors there like this is

602
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,200
spidey spider like conti somewhere in

603
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,520
the middle at this point in time and you

604
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,679
can name the other ones too

605
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,400
and why am i using this

606
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,400
um

607
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,279
this is because uh i think

608
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,799
i come to the

609
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:19,760
um

610
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,480
the challenge right now

611
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,440
with

612
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,720
uh the who shares wins concept

613
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,279
we have a powerful instrument

614
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,480
to share out information but also to

615
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,440
entertain collaboration and you know we

616
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,400
can use it as city but you might use it

617
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,480
if you wish and

618
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,400
the concept doesn't perhaps fit

619
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,480
perfectly in your organization but it

620
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,279
can be tweaked to your own desire

621
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,240
and

622
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,279
i think

623
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,480
if we are

624
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,799
building this information position

625
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,880
towards

626
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,200
a for example on conti

627
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,080
and

628
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,960
if we share this information and if we

629
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,400
compare

630
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,240
our

631
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,320
top 10 thread actors

632
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,360
and then

633
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,919
start sharing information and building

634
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,679
information positions

635
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,159
perhaps we can also then form

636
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,679
the alliances

637
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,080
those you know those public private

638
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,840
multi-disciplinary

639
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,200
groups

640
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,320
and use the concept to share our

641
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,600
intelligence and basically action

642
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,520
that information against the the the

643
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,760
criminal and nation-state groups that

644
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,840
are targeting us

645
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,240
and um

646
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,679
that's what i would like to achieve

647
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,200
with my who shares wins concept i want

648
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,799
this

649
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,360
to go from information sharing to

650
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,279
actionable information and to engagement

651
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,760
so i challenge you and then i stop i

652
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,279
challenge you to you know come to me

653
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,120
and

654
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,880
let's compare notes

655
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,400
on what are your top ten threat actors

656
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,799
and we will share the information we

657
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,279
have and then improve

658
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,320
our information position and that is

659
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,799
what i wanted to to share here

660
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,640
with you and

661
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,039
thank you for listening to my first

662
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,640
first

663
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,430
presentation

664
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:29,679
[Applause]

665
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,600
yes if anyone has any questions i said

666
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,960
we have microphones at the front and in

667
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,840
the middle

668
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,200
you make it easy for me

669
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,840
that's because wasn't in the room but

670
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,520
i'll ask a question

671
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,399
i'll ask a question thank you yeah so

672
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,760
um

673
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,840
great overall concept and

674
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,679
presentation here so good job on your

675
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,240
first first

676
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,559
my question to you is what metrics did

677
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,600
you use to actually prove to management

678
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,039
etc

679
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,200
that the sharing actually helped you win

680
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,880
i was hoping to see a couple of graphs

681
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,520
or a couple of numbers or something here

682
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,440
to to kind of what you know this is the

683
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,279
kind of thing where

684
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,080
uh it's the that kind of evidence is

685
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,919
really useful to have when having those

686
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,159
conversations with management etc about

687
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,159
why to break down the barriers and share

688
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,240
some of what we have with

689
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,320
others because we're that makes us x

690
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,320
percent more effective etcetera so if

691
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,159
you could share anything that you were

692
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,399
able to track or the metrics you were

693
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,240
even if they were informal metrics what

694
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,320
you were using to declare success in

695
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,960
this that would be really useful thanks

696
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,320
thank you very much for your question

697
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,399
and it's a very good one and

698
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,200
i'm going to be honest here uh

699
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,120
the the

700
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,679
what we used was basically the examples

701
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,559
of shares and the feedback we got from

702
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,880
it and feedback is not always

703
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,760
the the things and we that's what we

704
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,559
brought to our

705
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,039
leadership but the most important thing

706
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,880
was to

707
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,200
make sure that our

708
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,600
the instrument the processes the control

709
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,559
documents that we wrote that they were

710
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,159
accepted by our management and by by

711
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,440
legal that was our first achievement

712
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,360
and

713
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,919
for the rest we regularly

714
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,600
just

715
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,640
provide metrics of how many

716
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,279
shares we've put out

717
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,480
and whenever we get good feedback we

718
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,840
bring that in

719
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,080
but the process isn't

720
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,720
that long running that we already can

721
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,600
have

722
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,440
uh beautiful

723
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,840
graphs

724
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,399
of how good this actually works but we

725
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,440
feel it works and it is indeed important

726
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,320
to convince your leadership

727
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,360
and

728
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,480
if you want we can

729
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,159
outside of this meeting try to um

730
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,159
to get get you more information on that

731
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,240
i'm going to throw a question to you um

732
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,360
how do you

733
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,840
you talked about auditing etc uh how do

734
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,600
you track the information that you've

735
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,279
shared do you have a formal system for

736
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,520
it and how does that affect potential

737
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
auditing in the future of what you've

738
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,480
shared yeah

739
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,919
it is still a bit clunky system but we

740
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,360
do record

741
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,360
we have a process

742
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,080
based on

743
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,159
on year and

744
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,600
excel and that's where we

745
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,480
that's where we track every share that

746
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,919
we make also whether it's a quick share

747
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,440
of make a checker chair and we record

748
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,320
those

749
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,720
also who made them and where we have

750
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,200
sent them to at this point in time it's

751
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,519
still just an email-based

752
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,559
system

753
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,039
nevertheless

754
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,360
what we want to do is to further

755
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,320
automate that and also for example start

756
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
to use misp

757
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,440
in for the bigger part of the sharing

758
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,480
and

759
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,880
use that process also to

760
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,279
record what we have shared out

761
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,600
there

762
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,640
are there any other questions

763
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,880

764
