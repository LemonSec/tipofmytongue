1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,200
good morning everybody good morning

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,400
uh so my name is mick moren

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,800
i'm irish and i'm here i want to make it

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,520
very clear that i'm here representing

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,680
uh or at least with my ucd hat my

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,840
university college dublin hat on rather

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,920
than my law enforcement hat

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,680
which is on guarded shirakana which is

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,039
the national police here in ireland and

10
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,040
they haven't approved me to be here so

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,280
in that sense so i'm not representing

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,160
them

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,200
um

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,559
i

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,960
presented the first 11 years ago in

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,399
vienna

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,920
and i'm looking forward to the next time

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,640
because that will give me an opportunity

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,280
to use my irish accent to get a laugh

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,199
because the next time will be deterred

21
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,160
time so i'm looking forward to that

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,760
my partner in crime today is uh will

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,920
introduce himself so i'm on martel i'm

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,559
doing instant response and

25
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,280
digital forensics but net hunting and

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,720
threatening sale for the last 18 years

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,400
with quite a few people in the audience

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,040
today so thank you for being here and

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,320
i'm looking forward to this discussion

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,080
and presentation with me

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,080
okay so this yeah it's a sensitive

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,520
subject we're talking about child

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,439
exploitation we may mention things like

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,200
penises and vaginas during the

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,280
conversation so it's important that you

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,119
understand that before we start

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,520
if you find anything here today or if

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,200
you feel there's a risk of you being

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,280
triggered then feel free to leave nobody

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,400
thinks anything different uh of you uh

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,400
in in in the event of that

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,159
if you need any if you do find yourself

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,200
triggered

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,320
one in four that ie is a very good uh

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,600
organization here who will find your

46
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,960
help in your own country or will give

47
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,040
you some instant help here

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,720
if on the other hand you are somebody

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,960
who finds that you think about children

50
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,799
in ways that perhaps you shouldn't

51
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,960
you'll get some help at the

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,000
unfortunately named pedo.help which is a

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,040
website which offers self-help to people

54
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,360
who are concerned about their thoughts

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,280
in relation to children

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,200
and certainly it's a it's a very welcome

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,399
prevention

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,878
initiative

59
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,319
so

60
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,520
we're

61
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,760
really here to talk to you about this

62
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,920
uh insider attack

63
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
that you have never heard of

64
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,840
and um

65
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,160
yeah if you have any questions

66
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,520
again because the subject matter is

67
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,560
sensitive

68
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,560
feel free please to pop your questions

69
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,720
in here all right we won't be saving any

70
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,879
ip addresses we won't be anything like

71
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,959
that but it it's a way for you to put in

72
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,720
an anonymous question if you feel

73
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,160
uncomfortable about speaking over this

74
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,879
subject matter before the

75
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,319
before your peers

76
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,920
so feel free to

77
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,840
ask any questions

78
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,000
so because it's such a deep

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,519
and meaningful

80
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,800
uh issue

81
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,400
we decided to open with a little bit of

82
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,920
carl jung

83
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,200
and basically jung makes the point about

84
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,640
the fact that you cannot be fully

85
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,440
enlightened unless you face the darkness

86
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,280
and it's a metaphor that i use often

87
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,879
when talking about child sexual abuse

88
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,560
within our communities

89
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,920
is that if you shine a light on darkness

90
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,080
there's nothing left but light

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,360
and so

92
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,879
i thank you all for being here today

93
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,720
because it is a subject matter that is

94
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,280
sensitive it's difficult and because

95
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,440
it's in the difficult drawer

96
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,599
often the drawer is opened

97
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,519
and immediately closed again

98
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,280
and point we one of the points we want

99
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,480
to make to you here today is that look

100
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,159
yes its subject is a difficult subject

101
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,560
matter uh but if you understand it a

102
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,640
little bit better then perhaps you'll

103
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,640
have less of a problem dealing with it

104
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,879
especially on your on whatever services

105
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,080
or platforms that you're putting in

106
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,879
place in the world

107
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,080
so uh i'm going to start

108
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,840
roman's going to continue and then we're

109
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,159
going to finish together so i wanted to

110
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,360
talk to you very quickly about the

111
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,840
different crime types that exist in an

112
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,640
online child sexual exploitation and

113
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,000
abuse environment grooming where where

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,080
an adult puts a strategy in place that

115
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,959
that results in abuse of the child

116
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,879
live streaming of child sexual abuse to

117
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,799
order this is something that people who

118
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,840
work in financial services will probably

119
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
see a little bit

120
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,199
for relatively small sums of money

121
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,440
people in poorer regions of the world

122
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,000
are encouraged by people from the west

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,639
to abuse their children to order live on

124
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,600
camera

125
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,520
this is getting bigger we're seeing it

126
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,160
like that from a policing perspective

127
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,080
and we have been seeing it since

128
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,160
2007 2006 2007 but now in the last and

129
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,800
especially during covet it shot straight

130
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,280
up the graph just went like that

131
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,759
um online sexual coercion and extortion

132
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,000
otherwise known as sex darshan where a

133
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,080
child is encouraged to share an image

134
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,280
that perhaps they wouldn't share with

135
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,720
their grandmother

136
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,400
and then from there that's used as a

137
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,639
threat platform jumping

138
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,280
across it's used as a threat to extract

139
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,199
even more and more

140
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,000
uh sexualized content from the child

141
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,120
that generally results and peaks off in

142
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,039
stuff like

143
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,240
the child abusing a sibling for the the

144
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,800
the the blackmailer

145
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,120
or uh indeed where they can't deal with

146
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,360
it anymore it often results in the child

147
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,000
self-harming uh and we often hear them

148
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,680
the worst cases we always see in the

149
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,160
press are the ones that involve

150
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,199
suicide of course

151
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,880
i'm just going to play this small video

152
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,600
for you before we start

153
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,520
so

154
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,160
[Music]

155
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,160
so

156
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:08,759
[Music]

157
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,109
[Music]

158
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,240
so we're going to concentrate on csam

159
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,199
here

160
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,599
child sexual abuse material

161
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,440
sometimes it's called child pornography

162
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,680
but at the end of the day it is a

163
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,360
documented

164
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,280
uh a documented

165
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,919
a documentary if you like of the abuse

166
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,319
of a child

167
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,759
sometimes the abuse is recorded

168
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,080
sometimes it's uploaded to the internet

169
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,759
sometimes it's sold sometimes it's

170
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,400
swapped but the point is that it's out

171
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,599
there

172
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,479
and

173
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,479
sometimes it's called child pornography

174
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,039
but you know it's the people who like it

175
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,280
the most who like to call it pornography

176
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,560
the copine scale is very handy because i

177
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,960
don't want to put images of child sexual

178
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
abuse up here on the screen

179
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
but you can imagine it and so the copine

180
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,720
scale gives it to you in text

181
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,080
and was it

182
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,680
was it oscar wilde who said that

183
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,360
sometimes the thoughts of death are

184
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
worse than death itself it actually

185
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,639
might be better to actually see the

186
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,560
images or the movies than to actually

187
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,160
read about them here

188
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,800
these ones the coping scale is 10 is 10

189
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,680
steps 10 levels one two and three

190
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,080
are not illegal

191
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,759
four and five

192
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,479
are not illegal

193
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,400
four and five are not illegal

194
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,840
but what they are and what's very

195
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,759
important to remember is that they are

196
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,160
often an indication of a sexual interest

197
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
in children so even though it might not

198
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,280
be illegal

199
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,919
it may be that they are

200
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,919
these this one's here for example we

201
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,839
tend to call child sexual exploitation

202
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,080
material where the child is dressed in a

203
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,599
sexual manner is definitely and clearly

204
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,159
being sexualized

205
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,120
the

206
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,399
from six

207
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,120
to

208
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,640
10

209
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,120
are the illegal ones generally speaking

210
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,959
the eu directive and things like that

211
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,120
generally speaking concentration on the

212
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,279
anal or genital region of the child or

213
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,360
the child engaged in witnessing a sex

214
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,000
act or involved in the sex act

215
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,680
generally speaking

216
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,959
is illegal

217
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,880
where a description of it is written in

218
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,600
text it is generally also illegal and

219
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,480
where images might be deep fakes or

220
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,720
might be pseudo images they are also

221
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,279
illegal generally speaking from six to

222
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,560
ten

223
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,279
nine and ten

224
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,680
if you read number ten a there picture

225
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,760
showing a child being tied bound beaten

226
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
whipped or otherwise subjected to

227
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,399
anything that implies pain unfortunately

228
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,839
we see an awful lot of that

229
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,480
when we talk about

230
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,279
don't know is the water is it the water

231
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,560
blocking the

232
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,000
the signal

233
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,279
i think

234
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,680
okay so now i'm sorry

235
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,000
this is an instant response uh keynote

236
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,800
and

237
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,640
we know there are horrible things on the

238
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,640
internet right but it's quite rare isn't

239
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,440
it

240
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,839
yeah very rare indeed in fact it's so

241
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,760
rare that the national center for

242
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,760
missing exploited children got

243
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,920
29.3 million reports

244
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,839
of child sexual abuse material are

245
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,360
related to it

246
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,480
last year last year

247
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,760
all right

248
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,200
it's that rare

249
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,959
okay and this is the national center for

250
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,160
missions by children in the united

251
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,839
states of america who get these cyber

252
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,839
tips from companies based in the united

253
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,600
states of america who are complying with

254
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,920
law that says that they must report

255
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,760
incidents of this on their systems so

256
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,079
29.3 million

257
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,279
these are examples of what you can find

258
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,440
coming in from those companies most of

259
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,160
them

260
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,279
uh are

261
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,279
online companies who

262
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,279
who are providing the services and

263
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,120
platforms that we are very familiar with

264

267
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,200
the idea that

268
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,040
it's a rare thing i don't know where

269
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,120
it's coming from because

270
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,040
this is what our graph is looking like

271
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,200
and this is what it is

272
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,600

how many of them had images of children

289
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,519
on their tree roma would you like to

290
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,880
make a guess

291
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,640
but you know because you're behind the

292
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,959
curtain so you know

293
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,160
anyone out there like to make a guess

294
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,560
20

295
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,200

it's rough

300
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,800
all right but if i told you that eighty

301
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,040
percent of the material that's out there

302
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,279
is prepubescent

303

307
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,600
roma what's very important to remember

308
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,279
is that the anal rape of a

309
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,519
three-year-old while it's terrible it's

310
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,360
no better or no worse than the annual

311
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,240
rape of a nine-year-old yeah come on no

312

that's what you're dealing with but

313
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,800
that's what we're dealing with here why

314
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,000
are you telling me this i mean this is a

315
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,360
critical security conference i mean

316
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,040
we're not dealing with society issues

317
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,560
right because it's found

318
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,200
everywhere because if you put a platform

319
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,320
online if you put a service online it is

320
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,279
going to be abused by people

321
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,320
who are involved in this area

322
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,480
it's absolutely your business

323
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,040
it's absolutely got to do with what you

324
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,800
do every day

325
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,880
all right it's not about illegal it's

326
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,000
not about

327
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,079
it's just

328
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,320
either safety by design which is going

329
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,360
to take consideration of this or either

330
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,120
it's a threat to your network end the

331

story a threat to your services it's a

332
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,440
threat to your to your beautiful rack

333
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,760
system

334
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,680
the threat within

335
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,680
that you haven't seen come

336
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,639

and where is it hosted well on the web

338
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,040
83 percent of it is hosted in the west

339
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,959
all right that was

340
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,600
we could talk about that all day but 83

341
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,800
of the web

342
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,040
traffic related to csan is hosted in the

343
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,279
west okay so who can be downloading

344
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,839
these sort of things right anybody

345
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,600
anybody can be downloading it roma

346
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,120
anybody

347
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,839
all right including geniuses that work

348
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,120
for you

349
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,560
well okay i guess i guess there is

350
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,720
always a small number of bad apples in

351
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,040
the world right of course and i mean how

352
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,279
many people would you say in the world

353
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,560
have

354
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,240
sexual interest in children anyone want

355
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,800
to make a guess

356
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,800
really yeah come on this is the only

357
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,760
choices we have yeah

358
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,120
there's no there's no point involved

359
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,600
because all of the academic studies

360
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,120
that have been done

361
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,360
of them all

362
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,399
none of them are below two percent

363
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,079
and again

364
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,720
all of these are done in the west

365
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,639
so we haven't started in the gulf we

366
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,720
haven't started in asia we haven't

367
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
started yet so two percent of westerners

368
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,000
i don't know how many people are living

369
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,519
in persons yeah how many people do have

370
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,720
in their room today

371
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,399
wow

372
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,880
you want to put your hands up

373
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,079
all right

374
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,480
we'll stop we'll stop poking

375
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,639
so why do they collect see sam right

376
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,160
many many different reasons sometimes

377
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,600
for profit

378
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,480
but often it's a needs-driven activity

379
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,399
all right it's sexual

380
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,959
it's for arousal purposes

381
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,440
it's for masturbation

382
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,040
i'm always challenged to get that word

383
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,839
into every talk i do

384
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,120
it's it's sometimes for community

385
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,000
because within these chat rooms and

386
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,680
websites where

387
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,079
people gather around this issue

388
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,800
people feel very important

389
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
those who are actually abusing children

390
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,279
right now and who are

391
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,760
posting new material all the time they

392
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,959
are the king

393
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,639
in rooms like this because they are the

394
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,600
ones who are in a position to ensure

395
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,399
that

396
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,560
it's there's new stock coming online all

397
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,560
the time and when i say new stock of

398
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,680
files i am talking about new

399
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,959
sessions of abuse against these children

400
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,880
two good examples of what we're dealing

401
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,279
with at both extremes

402
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,199
this is a former colleague of mine

403
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,719
clearly he wasn't a dentist

404
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,680
he's a former member of vanguard of

405
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,480
shiakana a police officer who pleaded

406
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,720
guilty to possession of csan he got

407
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,160
involved in a conversation with an

408
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,000
undercover police officer

409
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,399
that resulted in him

410
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,560
chatting about sexual matters with a

411
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,440
13-year-old girl in inverted comas he

412
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,320
pleaded guilty

413
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,639
example at the other end of the scale uh

414
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,920
just giving away the answer to the

415
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,399
question the next question god damn it

416
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,120
right

417
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,720
another example at the other end of the

418
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
scale is this guy peter scully an

419
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,120
australian guy

420
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,519
fled australia to the philippines

421
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,399
put on a a a website called nlf no

422
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,000
limits fun

423
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,079
he produced the daisy's destruction

424
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,120
series

425
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,519
and i know it sounds cliched but

426
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,920
definitely the worst [ __ ] i've ever seen

427
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,120
in my life

428
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,199
level 10 and beyond

429
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,519
a level 10 plus

430
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,920
so much level 10

431
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,160
that of the three girls that he abused

432
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,120
together along with his girlfriend

433
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,040
and then live streamed

434
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,240
for profit for payment on his website no

435
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,639
level no no limits fun

436
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,240
of the tree girls only two of them were

437
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,440
ever found alive the third one was found

438
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,799
buried in his basement

439
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,480
whether or not he produced the snob

440
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,319
video

441
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,599
we don't know

442
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,439
it's very unlikely that he didn't he was

443
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,039
at that level

444
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,400
so how how

445
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
so the guy is selling this on his

446
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,240
website so that means he had to have

447
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,599
like a vps hosting payment platform you

448
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,599
know all the online storage that you can

449
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,959
imagine maybe

450
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,960
a cdn or something

451
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,000
and who tell me roma is controlling all

452
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,160
of this cdn yeah i get your points

453
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,440
platforms

454
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,120
and here's another point here's another

455
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,000
point

456
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,240
as you will demonstrate later on both of

457
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,679
these geniuses could have been working

458
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,280
for you ah come on it could have been

459
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,840
working within your security team could

460
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,919
have been working in your organization

461
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,080
who would be stupid enough to do these

462
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,280
sort of things from from work right

463
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,280
oh no so

464
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,200
i know i already gave you the answer so

465
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,640
i'll give it to you straight away all

466
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,600
right

467
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,520
this

468
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,799
is a fact

469
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,080
and i think

470
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,679
i can say it because i'm law enforcement

471
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,200
and i've heard it here and i've heard it

472
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,640
there and i've heard it from companies

473
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,600
who are selling products that will solve

474
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,559
this problem for you

475
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,840
have you

476
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,440
what do you think it is number one well

477
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,640
i'm thinking about the number of

478
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,240
employees in my organizations and i'm

479
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,720
doing math now yeah

480
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,160
and would you not

481
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,720
all right

482
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,240
that's a

483
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,240
podcast that i highly recommend you

484
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,720
listen to called hunting warhead i

485
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,559
highly recommend you listen to it it'll

486
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,000
give you a very very very good uh

487
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,360
rundown on this so

488
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,320
when we talk about victims

489
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,000
we have to realize that behind every

490
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,600
child sexual abuse issue there are

491
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,120
victims and

492
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,640
none of these children exist in real

493
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,320
life again i said i wasn't going to

494
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,840
display anything i wouldn't do it to

495
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,360
them to the kids

496
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,200
because they've been abused already to

497
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,640
show their faces here would be further

498
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,120
abuse this is from a website not a real

499
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,960
person.com or something like that all

500
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,840
right

501
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,000
but it's a nice analogy a nice metaphor

502
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,840
because see the way some of the kids are

503
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,679
hidden behind others

504
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,039
well

505
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,720
that's because of maybe where they're

506
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,320
located in the world

507
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,240
or where

508
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,919
what race they are

509
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:20,799
or

510
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,480
what um

511
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,559
whether they're law enforcement

512
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,679
are working

513
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,200
on this issue or not in their country

514
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,679
they get hidden behind other victims

515
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,880
boys often get hidden behind girls

516
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,640
uh

517
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,200
younger older kids often get hidden

518
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,799
behind younger kids

519
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,640
these are all issues and metaphors and

520
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,160
issues that we need to deal with with

521
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,960
this

522
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,200
and one of the ways that it gets hidden

523
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,280
oftentimes because one of the biggest

524
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,360
best pieces of work that law enforcement

525
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,440
do with victims of child sexual abuse

526
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,960
material is they do what's known as

527
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,640
victim identification

528
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,480
where through the examination of the

529
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,400
material that's found online or during

530
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,919
searches or whatever

531
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,760
they they trace the kids they find the

532
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,919
kids and by finding the kids they will

533
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,720
often and in most cases find the abuser

534
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,320
as well because

535
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,720
the vast majority of child sexual abuse

536
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,799
takes place within the family home or in

537
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,360
the immediate family circle realities

538
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,720
again

539
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,159
so these kids are often hidden and one

540
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,640
of the ways that these kids get hidden

541
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,159
and forgotten

542
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,559
is because people from your constituency

543
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,960
find material on their systems

544
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,400
and delete it

545
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,559
because that's the easiest thing to do

546
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,320
and when they delete it they perhaps

547
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,640
have deleted the only chance that this

548
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,760
child has of stopping abuse that started

549
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,360
when they were three years of age and

550
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,000
continues until adulthood

551
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
that's your constituency that's why this

552
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,480
matters to you that's why it matters

553
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,679
that's why we're here today

554
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,000
i'm about to throw this

555
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,320
out into the too far away

556
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,600
and victims

557
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,520
of child sexual abuse

558
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,679
have a high degree of dysfunction later

559
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,000
in life difficulties in becoming

560
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,080
relevant people in society

561
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,520
these are the words of victims that you

562
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,200
see here i didn't make these up these

563
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,120
are victims themselves named victims

564
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,640
ones who get online every day

565
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,200
and search for their own abuse pictures

566
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,760
20 years after it happened

567
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,000
because in their minds they can never be

568
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,840
at rest they can never move on they can

569
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,159
never get closure because they're

570
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,159
dealing constantly

571
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,919
with the threat that someone will

572
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,840
recognize them in the street and i could

573
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,919
tell you some horror stories i just

574
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,440
don't have time

575
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,280
of people who have been recognized in

576
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,760
the street are of who have gone public

577
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,600
for some reason

578
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,520
maybe that they made a presentation at

579
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,360
their work or whatever and then the

580
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,520
comments section is oh i remember you

581
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,840
when you were much younger

582
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,880
oh boy

583
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,400
you don't look so pretty without a [ __ ]

584
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,679
in your mouth

585
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,200
these are the sort of comments that goes

586
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
on under the pictures

587
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,280
of this person getting presented

588
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,520
graduating from university

589
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,559
graduating from high school

590
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,400
this is jurgen stock

591
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,080
an old boss of mine

592
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,760
bka

593
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
now secretary general of interpol and

594
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,679
this is what he said

595
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,120
and i have been saying it and i said it

596
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
11 years ago in vienna to you we can't

597
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,640
do this on our own law enforcement can't

598
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,200
do this on their own this is monstrous

599
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,159
it's huge the volumes are enormous we

600
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,360
don't have access behind your curtain

601
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,039
we don't know what's happening on your

602
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,240
services

603
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,840
we don't know what's happening on your

604
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,120
platforms

605
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,400
privacy gdpr

606
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,480
legal

607
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
restraints mean that we can't see and

608
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,039
rightly so and rightly so

609
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,720
but unless you're interested in doing

610
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,480
something about it then nothing will be

611
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,679
done about it on your side of the fence

612
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,600
nothing

613
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,440
if you open that drawer and it's the

614
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,600
difficult drawer and you open it and you

615
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,919
see something and you make it go away

616
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,039
you're wrong

617
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,120
you're wrong

618
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,440
i'll show you why

619
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,159
so now we move on to part two

620
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,000
so as i said earlier i'm an instant

621
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,400
response person at the core so i'll

622
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,320
share two use cases

623
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,760
of

624
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,440
incidents that involve system i was

625
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,600
never really hunting for system so it's

626
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,240
just a thing that happens and the

627
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,640
lessons i've learned the very hard way

628
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,039
so case number one is how to turn your

629
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,440
organization into the number one sesame

630
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,320
provider in the world

631
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,919
um so these are real cases that have

632
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,200
been investigated investigating sorry

633
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,320
which are not necessarily my own

634
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,840
organization but they're part of the

635
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,919
research and education sector in which

636
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:56,720
i'm

637
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,679
having

638
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,440
my main work

639
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,760
so it all started with a letter from the

640
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,600
police as usual you know one of the

641
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,039
european dresses was associated with

642
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,679
serious season received the letter

643
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,120
um

644
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,320
and it was

645
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,400
18 months ago you have to deal with it

646
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,310
18 months ago i mean we do foreign

647
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,640
[Laughter]

648
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,679
so

649
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,679
when this happened this is like a human

650
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,760
operational nightmare for a secure

651
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,440
security team it's a serious case and it

652
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,120
was 18 months ago

653
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,120
so well it's serious enough that we

654
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,400
start

655
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,080
you know in depth internet

656
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,240
investigations good news we have a nice

657
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,159
inventory so we could find the computer

658
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,159
that was involved um

659
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,480
it was a retire but it still existed so

660
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,400
we just walk in the person's office and

661
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,159
say look we're looking for this laptop

662
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,760
can we have it please and yeah sure

663
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,919
here's my own laptop uh is yours it's

664
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:48,799
yours

665
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,919
investigate so it's like okay uh let's

666
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,840
have a look at this but before we do so

667
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,120
the legal department comes and says no

668
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,799
no no you don't touch that laptop you

669
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,279
know cezam law enforcement you just give

670
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,960
the laptop the name of the owner of the

671
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,720
laptop to the police they deal with it

672
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,400
but you know i'm an investigator um so

673
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,720
i want to investigate and you know

674
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,880
confirm the fact so

675
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,360
we look into it without touching any of

676
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,520
the season part and it's very clear it's

677
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,960
clear cut case you should have been

678
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,720
disciplined for ignoring the legal

679
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,919
department

680
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,440
maybe everyone knows the lawyer

681
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,960
especially because the laptop you know

682
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,120
contains all of the evidence the police

683
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,600
was right and there was all sorts of

684
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,640
horrible content that we can find

685
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,200
but i kept digging because i'm really

686
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,120
like to hunt this kind of things

687
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,840
to the very end to be really really sure

688
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,960
and very late at one night i found

689
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,520
a very strange entry in one log file and

690
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,080
one of the windows events log file

691
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,120
and

692
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,400
it really showed that there was more to

693
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,559
the story and basically i will spare you

694
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,000
the details because i don't have time

695
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,760
but it led to weeks and weeks of

696
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,360
forensics works and internal

697
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,159
investigation and what we uncovered

698
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:00,960
um

699
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,120
is that we had a former disgruntled

700
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,240
employee

701
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,039
that person was fired after stealing

702
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,039
significant amounts of hardware printers

703
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,039
servers laptops what have you and he was

704
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,480
selling it

705
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,320
it included the macbook pro of the

706
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,480
former system of the team

707
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,840
and so

708
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,840
what the person did the employee did is

709
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,240
that he hacked his way back in

710
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,679
hijaid accounts host and he spent months

711
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,520
stalking exploring creating vms creating

712
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
accounts moving around

713
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,880
and really

714
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,120
finally he gained access to the computer

715
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,240
of his former boss for revenge and the

716
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,240
guy was technically really really good

717
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,840
so what he did when he

718
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,120
had access to the computer of his boss

719
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,200
he started an emul client in the

720
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,880
background and

721
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,880
started sharing and downloading huge

722
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,039
amounts of see them

723
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,279
we got very lucky on this one in a way

724
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,200
because the email clients spontaneously

725
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,240
crashed after 30 days so we didn't have

726
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,320
like 18 months of this

727
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,120
um but we spend a lot of time doing

728
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,480
forensics and we could reconstruct what

729
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,679
this um immule client looked like so

730
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,600
lots and lots of style you can't read it

731
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,880
and that's pretty okay because the name

732
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,720
of the files are really really um

733
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,159
intense you see pthc

734
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,679
that's short code for pre-teen hardcore

735
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,120
and if you look up above it there

736
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,200
ten-year-old boy

737
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,080
gets

738
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,399
i'd say it's gets

739
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,840
yeah you can do the best to rest

740
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,039
yourself

741
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,960
so what did we do well the first thing

742
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,720
is that this in-depth investigation

743
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,039
saved the former boss i mean the owner

744
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,200
of the laptop so can you imagine the

745
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,720
consequences if you've given the name of

746
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
this person to the police i mean the

747
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,399
personal and professional impact

748
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,320
if you'd been accused right i mean you

749
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,840
can't go back to work i mean you know

750
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,679
people say there is uh

751
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,679
if there is smoke huh

752
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,480
so

753
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,640
um that was really a good thing we

754
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,200
investigated um also the discriminant

755
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,120
employee moved to a foreign country and

756
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,279
the police told us that an international

757
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,120
case was unlikely to succeed and as far

758
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,120
as we know there was no legal forward

759
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,760
thank you mick as far as i'm aware or if

760
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,360
you asked me to make a comment on this i

761
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,480
would say police believe the

762
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,799
international case unlikely to succeed

763
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,080
is code for laziness

764
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,919
yeah we were starting we weren't lazy uh

765
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:20,880
with this

766
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,240
i'm not suggesting you're being lazy but

767
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,520
i am suggesting the police are being

768
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,840
lazy so anyway continuing back what was

769
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,600
found on the house so

770
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,279
we were all in shock and we realized

771
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,039
that on this laptop there were about

772
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:35,760
769 files sharing very hardcore content

773
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,120
and we were totally unprepared for that

774
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,840
so about half of the team

775
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,440
involved in the investigation could not

776
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,480
even look at the fine names right we had

777
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,919
to take precautions to not expose people

778
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,559
to actual find names the classification

779
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,559
was class 10 for most of it so the most

780
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,000
severe contents

781
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,559
but this was not the worst part right so

782
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,080
as i said i work in

783
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,840
research and education which means large

784
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,200
networks

785
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,520
so this means that this organization was

786
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,200
involuntary consisting of sharing for

787
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,360
the 30 days

788
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,840
1.6 terabytes of severe

789
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,039
season

790
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,480
so this means that

791
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,399
they shared

792
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,799
accommodated requests for more than 164

793
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,760
000 users downloading this material and

794
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,399
so for the 13 for 30 days this was the

795
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,240
top system provider

796
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,760
in the world i let that thinking this is

797
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,120
what you have to realize is how

798
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,919
how

799
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,279
knowledgeable this person was and how

800
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,760
serious it was because

801
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,200
he uploaded a peer-to-peer

802
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,679
service to run in the background

803
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,080
every time it's down uh something is

804
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,159
downloaded from peer-to-peer it's

805
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,600
available for

806
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,039
upload by somebody i know the other way

807
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,480
around yeah every time he downloads it's

808
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,200
now advertised and available via the

809
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,640
peer-to-peer

810
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,760
network

811
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,080
uh for download by others so if you work

812
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,279
in the security team this is probably

813
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,880
the worst day of your career when it

814
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,520
happens and this didn't happen to like a

815
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,480
small

816
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,960
security team run by phd students this

817
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,039
is a mature security team they have a

818
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,720
top-notch security operation center

819
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,799
real-time detection of attacks they use

820
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,279
intel with miss and other tools from

821
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,039
hundreds of partners they defend against

822
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,200
apt nations taste and you know your

823
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,279
off-the-shelf cyber crime every day so

824
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,480
they're really experienced but they

825
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,440
didn't see

826
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,000
any of this coming and can you imagine

827
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,880
had

828
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,559
he listened to the legal department

829
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,640
handed this over to the police

830
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,159
and they're too lazy to do an

831
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,600
international job can you imagine how

832
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,520
lazy they wouldn't have been

833
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,799
to find

834
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,120
an anomaly in a log file see that's your

835
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,880
department

836
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,360
that's your department

837
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,200
so anyway they did not see any of this

838
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,520
coming and the reason is that they never

839
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,799
considered this type of threats right

840
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,039
they focused on other things

841
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,480
like what

842
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,320
well like you know all the shells cyber

843
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,880
crime botnets and spam and things but

844
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,880
not this not this

845
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,799
so now i'm going to move to case number

846
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:03,679
two

847
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,120
is do you prefer your sesam on-prem or

848
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,440
in the cloud

849
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,279
so this is a real case that i

850
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,519
investigated with uh actually two people

851
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,679
in the room today so i think i'm

852
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,200
thankful to both of them and i had to

853
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,640
change a few names and locations but

854
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,760
this is a real

855
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,799
case

856
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,880
so as usual it starts with the police

857
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,480
and an email from the police to a super

858
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,960
computing center in academia again

859
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,320
in italy

860
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,480
and they said that this computer center

861
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,559
had to follow others from the court and

862
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,559
they includes a long list of many

863
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,360
hundreds of video files and timestamps

864
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,279
that was uploaded from that academic

865
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,080
supercomputing center

866
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,200
online and it included many horrific

867
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,840
expertise find names all classified

868
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,600
of the worst in the scale so there are

869
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,039
different scales of a classification but

870
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,240
from what nick showed you this is the

871
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,320
worst category

872
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,399
the flow of the report was very clean in

873
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,760
fact it was uh flagged by google then

874
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,919
shared to net nick as i told you earlier

875
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,000
on those cyber tips so the company

876
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,159
shares it to google shares it to the

877
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,440
national center for mission exploited

878
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,519
children who share it to us law

879
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,200
enforcement they've since been taken out

880
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,600
of the loop so they'll go straight to

881
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,840
the italian police now so that those two

882
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,159
steps where u.s law enforcement send it

883
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,200
to their

884
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,519
uh liaison officers in in country that's

885
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,440
gone so now it's just neck mech directly

886
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,039
too he did a pretty good job on this one

887
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,360
mistake so well done yeah wasn't so easy

888
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,360
on our side because we couldn't figure

889
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,519
out whose problem it was

890
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,880
i mean

891
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,240
this

892
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,159
ip address in the computer center

893
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,080
nobody had a clue what it was supposed

894
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,120
to be doing

895
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,039
and who was running it

896
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,000
right

897
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,760
that's a big problem and the reason is

898
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,960
that this is

899
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,120
this physical host in the data center is

900
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,799
allocated to a large european computing

901
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:51,919
project

902
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,320
which is operating on

903
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,240
hundreds of such computer centers in

904
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,919
europe even in asia and south america

905
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,559
and other places

906
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,960
so you have to start peeling the the

907
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,279
onion

908
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,519
don't touch the computer move away from

909
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,840
the computer

910
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:12,960
so

911
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,440
um this what they did is that this

912
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,279
european computer project they allocated

913
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,120
some resources to a marketplace called

914
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,919
the federated cloud infrastructure

915
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,360
which

916
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,120
well and one of the many users so this

917
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,799
federated cloud infrastructure is an ers

918
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,720
and science eu project

919
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,640
and they continue to dig deeper and they

920
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,240
use this for their own

921
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,600
distributed global virtual

922
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,880
infrastructure

923
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,519
and as part of this virtual global

924
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,279
infrastructure they have all this and

925
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,279
minimize this badly but

926
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,960
and and what you can see here then

927
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,720
inside they even have a catalog for

928
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,559
applications to be running so you have

929
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,960
to go even deeper right

930
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,120
so that has to be pretty complicated

931
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,159
if you want to start assigning blame

932
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,760
so they have a marketplace for

933
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,679
researchers to deploy and develop their

934
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,000
own applications and ultimately they

935
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,760
rely on a private

936
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,440
partner

937
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,279
that is

938
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,200
flagging itself as streamlined devops

939
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,119
multi-cloud platform as a service based

940
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,199
on container technology now let me tell

941
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:11,918
you

942
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,359
the vast majority of my colleagues and

943
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,199
i'm not dissing them here but the vast

944
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,119
majority of my colleagues not those in

945
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,119
specialist units but the vast majority

946
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,520
of law enforcement officers in the world

947
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,440
understand the word streamlined after

948
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,119
that it's

949
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,639
well mick i have no idea what this means

950
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,560
this is marketing yeah but i know but

951
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,399
but if you have no idea no what hope

952
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,879
have i no what hope have i what i can

953
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,399
tell you is that if you look at the sort

954
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,839
of diagram which we try to build for

955
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:38,719
that

956
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,000
the attacker attacked an app running on

957
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,639
top of a distributed platform

958
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,239
which itself is operating on containers

959
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,679
right which itself is running only

960
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,359
distributed virtual infrastructure over

961
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,800
30 countries i understand how you

962
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,599
understand and then it's physically

963
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,839
hosted in hundreds of data centers right

964
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,680
hundreds hundreds and

965
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,320
ultimately you end up with an ip address

966
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,480
in an italian super ip address i

967
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,320
understand ip so if i have the ip

968
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,200
address i i have the guy yeah the thing

969
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,040
is you know these italians they own the

970
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,880
hardware and they are the legal entity

971
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,280
responsible no denial there but they

972
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,560
have no knowledge expertise or even

973
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,480
control over the actual platform that

974
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,160
was abused right but we have the ip

975
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,720
address yeah so because i address when

976
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,720
you do forensics

977
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,640
i have a surprise doing forensics in

978
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,359
such an environment is a nightmare right

979
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,119
and the reasons are very simple i mean

980
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,200
you have to work simultaneously with

981
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,359
called recover vm snapshots you have

982
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,960
live databases

983
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,920
that are never constantly changing

984
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,000
which contains online catalogs we have

985
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,400
many layers of very complex software

986
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,599
um

987
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,640
you know different countries are going

988
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,960
to be involved at each of these layers

989
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,599
different people different jurisdictions

990
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,920
and highly heterogeneous amounts of log

991
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,720
files right so if you do forensics well

992
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,760
good luck with that

993
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,359
easy for the police

994
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,720
yeah so it took some time and the

995
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,320
police and court slightly became

996
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,240
impatient no

997
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,320
and um there was a slow plot twist so

998
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,839
they decided okay the italian super

999
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,359
computing centers they can't do anything

1000
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,160
maybe so we're gonna name personally the

1001
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,000
head of operations of this european

1002
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,760
computing project

1003
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,599
as a person in charge and responsible so

1004
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,280
they bubble up

1005
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,960
they move from the black square to the

1006
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,440
gray square on top and this really put

1007
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,440
the pressure on this european project

1008
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,280
against things sorted

1009
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,640
in particular because there was a second

1010
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,480
plot twist which is exactly at the time

1011
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,960
net mix said that this infrastructure

1012
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,800
uploaded csm

1013
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,960
this streamlined devops multi-cloud

1014
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,240
platform the service based on controller

1015
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,800
technology actor reported that

1016
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,079
they noticed

1017
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,440
that on this platform an unusual traffic

1018
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,920
increase on the platform they reported

1019
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,320
it to the scientist uh in charge and

1020
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,200
jointly they decided to delete and

1021
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,079
respond involved to machine and delete

1022
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,480
two suspicious user accounts that they

1023
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,160
found on the platform exactly at the

1024
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,680
same time the exam wasn't and then they

1025
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,680
reported it or did they report it before

1026
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,000
they deleted or did they no at what

1027
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,599
point did they tell

1028
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,320
you

1029
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,320
no they never told us so they didn't

1030
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,160
follow any of the several instance

1031
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,520
response proceeded had in place or

1032
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,280
contacted anybody they just deleted it

1033
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,760
under the carpet and of story

1034
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,520
which was pretty bad

1035
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,680
so we had to really work with this uh

1036
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,520
streamline devops blah blah blah actor

1037
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,280
because this is really where most of the

1038
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,560
action happens

1039
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,240
and initially they helped us they were

1040
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,760
pretty nice and then they they

1041
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,359
understood that it was caesar and police

1042
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,280
was involved so they went quite silent

1043
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,640
and we were really worried they would

1044
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,720
lawyer up

1045
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,640
so eventually

1046
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,160
we called the ceo and said this is

1047
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,000
really serious you have to help us

1048
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,280
and they agreed to

1049
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,440
charge us five hundred dollars for two

1050
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,599
zoom calls in which they could help us

1051
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,599
and teach us how to use the intricacies

1052
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,520
of their complex systems

1053
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,760
they couldn't share any logs or data um

1054
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,079
regarding the unusual traffic or deleted

1055
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,800
vms which was all gone and the log files

1056
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,480
local log files or even the ones in the

1057
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,839
databases or even all well rotated or

1058
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,760
deleted prior to forensics so after you

1059
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,280
paid the 500

1060
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,920
then they helped you to find

1061
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,359
the problem no not really no so

1062
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,839
after a lot of time doing four and six

1063
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,599
three months of work we could only find

1064
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,440
two email addresses and two ap addresses

1065
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,200
from the attacker and the

1066
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,079
four things reports is basically

1067
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,359
empty

1068
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,480
so what we suspected is that there is

1069
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,760
circumstantial evidence that it was

1070
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,760
likely a professionally operated paid

1071
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,000
for service to download season and using

1072
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,079
this academic environment you had super

1073
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,920
good bandwidths and a very very good

1074
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,599
amount of storage so

1075
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,040
but anyway hey we never heard back from

1076
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,960
those no you didn't hear back from law

1077
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,240
enforcement because

1078
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,079
the amount of hoops that law enforcement

1079
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,160
then have to jump through in order to

1080
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,160
have the weird email addresses checked

1081
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,240
are enormous for example an mlat will

1082
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,520
take anything and a multi-level

1083
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,280
i don't know mla

1084
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,440
what's that stand for

1085
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,560
multilateral assistance assistant

1086
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,440
uh are you a real policeman yeah okay

1087
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,280
and that's just the bane of my life so i

1088
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,359
kind of ignored them but

1089
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,760
an mlat can take anything from six to 18

1090
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,240
months they are in fact a 19th century

1091
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,920
solution to a 21st century problem

1092
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,599
well the ndm that i was involved in was

1093
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,480
between

1094
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,320
germany and sweden

1095
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,119
it was very easy it took only a year to

1096
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,480
officially translate the document

1097
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,560
between german and sweden and between

1098
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,000
between the european union countries

1099
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,200
it's quite quick and there are other

1100
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,280
instruments now available but once you

1101
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,760
start to move outside the european union

1102
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,480
so

1103
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,480
anyway so these are just two simple

1104
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,839
examples of

1105
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,920
lessons learned the hard way but there

1106
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,280
are things you can do and so in this

1107
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,640
last part

1108
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,599
we're gonna

1109
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,680
you know expose a bit more how you can

1110
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,119
deal with this because even if you're

1111
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,960
not hunting for season season will find

1112
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,520
you as we saw because of the volume and

1113
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,040
the amount of flow employees doing it

1114
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,040
and the general issue

1115
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,240
before you do this you want to put up

1116
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:06,960
the

1117
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,280
qr code for the

1118
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,119
i don't have it here but uh

1119
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,839
people are free okay

1120
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,040
otherwise you can add the question after

1121
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,160
that yeah

1122
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,079
we leave some time for questions at the

1123
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,480
mics as well so mick can you what can

1124
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,040
you tell us about that

1125
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,240
well look

1126
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,640
what can you say about 18 months stuff

1127
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,520
you know if it has gone from google to

1128
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,760
netmech to the dhs to dhs in italy and

1129
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,240
it's gone from you know 18 months 18

1130
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,839
months is actually nice and short when

1131
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,480
it comes to an mla there's zero excuse

1132
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,520
for 18 months in relation to that but

1133
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,359
the headline on this slide

1134
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,960
is collaboration

1135
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,560
is working together having a

1136
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,760
relationship with your local law

1137
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,400
enforcement reaching out over the fence

1138
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,160
talking to them

1139
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,119
you know

1140
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,720
that if the police had the skills that

1141
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,000
you have they wouldn't be working for a

1142
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,640
functionaire's salary

1143
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,160
all right if they had the skills you

1144
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,040
have they'd be working for you

1145
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,839
okay

1146
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,640
so we absolutely need you

1147
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,640
and in order to do what's right you

1148
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,640
absolutely need us

1149
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,480
and working together

1150
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,720
we can make a difference we can make a

1151
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,359
huge difference

1152
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,240
explaining this stuff

1153
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,560
multi what is it called

1154
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,200
multi-platform yeah thingy yeah yeah

1155
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,800
explaining this

1156
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,800
to a jury and believe me i have

1157
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,359
explained this to a jury

1158
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,520
is very like i'd imagine the experience

1159
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,920
you have in explaining a cyber security

1160
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,880
incident in the c-suite

1161
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,720
all right you certainly can't talk about

1162
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,040
you can't use sales blurb there you have

1163
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,720
to use black and white

1164
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,040
okay so the first thing i highly

1165
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,800
recommend everybody in this room to do

1166
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,359
is to start treating csm as a form of

1167
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,160
cyber crime right and the way it is just

1168
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,319
like for any other type of

1169
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,119
crime you get indicators of compromise

1170
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,040
you put them in your security

1171
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,400
infrastructure stock or whatever you

1172
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,079
call it the cost should be virtually

1173
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,079
zero compared to the volume of data you

1174
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,720
would get for your average ipt

1175
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,720
um there is some

1176
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,880
caveats that we have to be careful with

1177
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,040
in terms of jurisdiction because the

1178
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,640
police is not very coordinated in some

1179
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,240
places and so you have to have

1180
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,000
some care with jurisdiction if you get

1181
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,599
indicators from a country that may not

1182
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,599
apply to yours et cetera but besides

1183
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,359
basic caveats it's pretty

1184
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:40,800
straightforward

1185
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,319
indicators are

1186
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,000
something you're always which are you're

1187
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,359
all familiar with

1188
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,520
there will be binary hashes or md5 or

1189
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,599
shawn you can

1190
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:50,880
test for

1191
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,800
your downloads or storage

1192
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,000
um your

1193
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,160
urls you can also

1194
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,880
put in your system fuzzy hashes uh but

1195
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,240
they are really really important in this

1196
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,440
case although they can lead to false

1197
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,359
positive but they can give you a clue uh

1198
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,359
what's going on and keyword lists as

1199
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,119
well uh which are maintained in some

1200
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,480
jurisdictions

1201
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,240
most indicators come

1202
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,720
with a severity or classifications

1203
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,960
and the bottom line here is that

1204
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,040
you don't have to look at sizab this is

1205
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,880
what it's changing having indicators

1206
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,160
means you don't have to look at the

1207
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,119
pictures

1208
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,560
you can just use automated

1209
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,720
classification rely on law enforcement

1210
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,319
and you don't have to look at it so

1211
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:29,440
don't be afraid these are just malicious

1212
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,720
files and you can treat them as so

1213
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,800
the second aspect i would like to

1214
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,560
highlight is to always investigate

1215
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,680
don't block

1216
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,319
always investigate there is a tip of the

1217
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,319
iceberg effect

1218
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,920
um

1219
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,359
where you can have an exponential impact

1220
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,280
when you investigate because most

1221
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,160
perpetrators are collector or regular

1222
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,280
abusers

1223
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,000
so i i have a small anecdote from imgur

1224
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,680
so when they joined thor

1225
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,359
uh they had the hashes and they put them

1226
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,839
in our system and within 20 minutes

1227
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,359
they detected on the

1228
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,880
unknown system hash that was being

1229
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,480
uploaded so they reported it

1230
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,160
appropriately but they did not stop

1231
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,040
there

1232
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,040
they looked at the account they did

1233
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,800
forensics they investigated and they

1234
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,920
discovered

1235
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,400
several hundred more pieces of cesam

1236
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
that had never been seen before

1237
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,920
and then these new hashes besides

1238
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,359
sharing his law enforcement to identify

1239
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,119
the victims could be shared in the

1240
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,240
community

1241
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,440
investigated and content be taken down

1242
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,040
so this really means that this strategy

1243
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,119
allows for an exponential impact when

1244
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,480
you investigate you will discover more

1245
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,160
you share it and then you discover more

1246
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,319
so there is no way perpetrators can

1247
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:38,560
share online images

1248
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,359
without any consequences

1249
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,079
you also have to consider insider

1250
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,000
attacks and sabotage this is pretty

1251
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,640
common that there are employees

1252
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,240
involved in downloading um caesar

1253
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,280
right

1254
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,599
yeah and i mean

1255
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,920
i i could give one whole hour on the

1256
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,319
offenders themselves and how they get

1257
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:01,839
involved in this business and how they

1258
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,480
end up and what they will do and you

1259
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,720
would be surprised one in 500 number

1260
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,079
also involves people using your devices

1261
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,359
uh

1262
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,760
downloading at home and viewing at work

1263
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,839
where they're not in a position to to to

1264
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,760
to do that at home

1265
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,119
when they're on the road people

1266
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,640
companies and some of them are in this

1267
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,400
room who have endpoint

1268
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,400
who have csam they treat it seriously

1269
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,160
within their organization they have it

1270
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,319
in the aup they make it clear that it'll

1271
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:29,599
be reported to law enforcement if

1272
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,440
there's anything of that nature found

1273
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,680
that sort of sort of policy decisions

1274
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,599
made within the company and then they

1275
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,520
have endpoint protection that will spot

1276
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,200
it and you'd be surprised how many

1277
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,040
people have usb keys that they plug into

1278
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,960
the devices that you're giving them

1279
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,119
probably the usb key that you gave them

1280
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,560
as well

1281
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,359
to do it and and

1282
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,119
always reporting it to ensure that it's

1283
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,440
added to the databases is absolutely

1284
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,040
essential because that's a

1285
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,560
virtuous circle

1286
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,319
uh there are efforts being made by the

1287
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,000
eu for example to they will have a

1288
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,400
national center the national center in

1289
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,560
in the united states they have hash sets

1290
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,599
that they share through the tech

1291
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,200
coalition with the with the online

1292
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,040
platforms so there's all sorts of

1293
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,560
initiatives and stuff out there and we

1294
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,839
can talk a little bit about that later

1295
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:12,720
but there

1296
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,800
but you can do your bit

1297
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,920
you can absolutely do your bit

1298
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,280
deleting it is the worst thing you can

1299
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,040
do i've already made that point and i

1300
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,720
banged the table when i said it it's

1301
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,160
absolutely the worst thing you can do

1302
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,160
because once you feed it into the law

1303
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,560
enforcement environment or even the ngo

1304
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,040
environment more and more

1305
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,480
then victim identification will be

1306
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,599
carried out

1307
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,200
and if

1308
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,440
that there are clues in those images

1309
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,720
that help

1310
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,760
then

1311
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,520
that child will be located and if that

1312
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,280
child is located the abuser is located

1313
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,359
and the whole thing stops so you're

1314
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,359
actually again remember sexual abuse

1315
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,760
doesn't take place just once it often

1316
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,920
continues throughout childhood

1317
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,839
over many many years

1318
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,200
and you know that the average time of

1319
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,880
disclosure what's another quiz for your

1320
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,319
roma what's the average time of

1321
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,680
disclosure for someone who's sexually

1322
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,680
abused as a child how many years would

1323
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,200
you say it takes them

1324
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,000
to

1325
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,920
disclose that they were abused how many

1326
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,040
years would you say i don't know how

1327
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,200
long can you hold the secret yeah

1328
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,599
the average is somewhere between 25 and

1329
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,440
30 years before people disclosed that

1330
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,240
they were sexually abused as children

1331
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,480
well still i think we can we can go on a

1332
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,800
deal right we can do

1333
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,240
investigation

1334
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,839
we can do detection we can do monitoring

1335
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,440
we can do forensics we know how to use a

1336
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,800
security team

1337
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,400
but you look at the content you do the

1338
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,640
classification and i'm not good at

1339
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,000
dealing with people so if you could deal

1340
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,280
with the victims and the perpetrators

1341
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,280
that i'll be very grateful yeah and at

1342
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,000
least and this is and this is the the

1343
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,839
faustian pack that we can put in place

1344
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:40,800
because

1345
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,960
we are used to dealing with this we are

1346
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,040
used to dealing with it by creating a

1347
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,200
hash or some form of signature and

1348
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,359
hopefully we get more ai classifiers and

1349
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:50,640
we get a standard in place so that

1350
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,960
there's ai will allow this to happen uh

1351
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,440
i will assist in finding

1352
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,400
blocking reporting it

1353
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,319
you know

1354
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,079
it means that you can you can see it and

1355
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,240
you know it's on on a list you don't

1356
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,319
have to look at it you don't have to

1357
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:09,359
decide where it fits on the copine scale

1358
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:10,880
and there are consultancies and there

1359
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,240
are people out there who can assist you

1360
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,119
with that anyway in the future but um

1361
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:16,319
one of the questions we actually have

1362
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:17,680
here is

1363
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,640
why don't the security vendors put these

1364
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,559
hash values in their

1365
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,880
things and do you know an answer to that

1366
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,960
question i think some do

1367
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,599
yeah and uh we are working with somebody

1368
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:30,800
wouldn't be here today you know one of

1369
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,160
the secret eventers and they do check

1370
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,359
for it

1371
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:34,720
but it's really difficult for them to

1372
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,079
act on it so they need more

1373
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,280
collaboration with law enforcement to

1374
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,200
leverage the data they get out yeah

1375
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,640
because one thing is important i mean

1376
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,800
reporting system found is important but

1377
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,920
reporting access to system is super hard

1378
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,520
and i'll give you a final case i've been

1379
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,800
involving involving quite recently um

1380
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,880
so imagine you are doing instant

1381
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,079
response

1382
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,040
um that is involving some system case so

1383
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,960
you have to be careful

1384
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,520
the laptop involved

1385
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,240
really really um is downloading sysan

1386
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,240
you identify the suspect

1387
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,880
but there is a caveat bring your own

1388
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,119
device or device that you don't own

1389
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,359
right i guess you've been already

1390
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:14,640
dealing with that right bring your own

1391
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,480
device that is compromised well this

1392
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,599
time

1393
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,680
the device is downloading system is

1394
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,280
owned by one person

1395
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,640
but this person is an i.t contractor not

1396
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,720
working for the organization

1397
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,200
and so the laptop is not so not owned by

1398
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,280
the organization so the main suspect

1399
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,440
doesn't work for you and the laptop

1400
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,559
isn't yours what do you do now

1401
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:37,760
you have evidence that is your crime

1402
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,800
committed

1403
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,240
what do you do now

1404
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,760
i mean if you want to accuse the person

1405
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,880
you have to look at the laptop you have

1406
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,640
to get the evidence out hand it over to

1407
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,760
the police but you have no jurisdiction

1408
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,599
you can't even look at the laptop

1409
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:48,559
right

1410
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,240
so it's it's a difficult position to be

1411
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,000
in so in that case what we did is after

1412
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,520
long discussions

1413
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,040
we

1414
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,000
looked

1415
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,920
um

1416
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,440
this was our legal department we decided

1417
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,440
to suspend the access of this person

1418
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,440
from the organization

1419
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,160
um we contacted the contractor and said

1420
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,040
you know

1421
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,920
this is

1422
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,720
a laptop that has been belonging to you

1423
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,480
it's being used by one person this

1424
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,520
person and this is the data that we saw

1425
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,880
related to the laptop this is what's

1426
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,319
been happening

1427
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:19,920
so the contractor phone backs

1428
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,920
immediately and says well i'm really

1429
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,079
sorry i mean i'm gonna take care of this

1430
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,079
this guy will never hear from him again

1431
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,319
um is fired right now and i'm gonna send

1432
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,960
somebody new tomorrow um

1433
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,160
you know

1434
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,079
okay that's the deal

1435
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,079
but he didn't report the case to

1436
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:37,599
enforcement

1437
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,319
and the suspect there of course he lost

1438
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:41,760
his healthy job

1439
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,040
but he found another job

1440
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,920
and the job he found was to be a

1441
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,520
caretaker

1442
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,000
for young children at a local hospital

1443
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,200
for mentally handicapped children

1444
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,960
right

1445
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,720
how did i know that

1446
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,040
well it turns out that this person

1447
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,599
physically abused five children starting

1448
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,480
at 30 months old for two years before he

1449
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,760
was arrested

1450
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,920
and the case was very very public

1451
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,760
the the person was arrested and the

1452
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,880
press said

1453
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,960
this person was a former employee of

1454
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,520
that i.t organization he was browsing

1455
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,520
seazam from work thousands of images and

1456
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,000
was fired because of browsing of season

1457
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,400
threat

1458
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,599
these people are needs driven they will

1459
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,280
not stop

1460
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,280
if that had been reported properly

1461
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,200
there's a chance they'd have stopped

1462
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,800
they certainly wouldn't have got a job

1463
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,400
in a hospital for mentally yeah so

1464
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,160
always reports and i have a big fail

1465
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,200
here

1466
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,800
and now i have to live with this because

1467
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,400
i had the data

1468
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,319
and i i could t i could give you we were

1469
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:45,680
running out of time so i could give you

1470
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,480
10 examples of this including including

1471
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,480
the police having

1472
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,559
having files

1473
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,720
in a drawer that would have allowed them

1474
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,160
to carry out a search at the house of a

1475
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,760
pediatrician

1476
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,520
and during the period of time that that

1477
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,359
file sat on the desk

1478
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:04,960
and the time that they finally did the

1479
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,079
job that pediatrician had abused nearly

1480
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,160
40 children

1481
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,839
under the age of 10

1482
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:13,920
in his workplace

1483
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,800
there's lots of things like that

1484
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,559
so we'll have about 10 minutes for

1485
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,079
questions i think but uh just as a quick

1486
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,240
summary uh you know i think the time is

1487
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,359
here

1488
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,480
so summary if you want like uh the

1489
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,400
bottom line of all this if you are

1490
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,680
operating a sister or running in a

1491
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,880
security team

1492
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,480
you have to have internal procedures

1493
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,079
specific to csm

1494
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,400
for computer security instance response

1495
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,960
for human resources and for

1496
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,040
your legal or jury

1497
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,720
well legal team

1498
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,480
have a strategy that is ensuring

1499
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,079
presumption of innocence preservation of

1500
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,280
data

1501
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,040
and that you can handle law enforcement

1502
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,559
possible cases

1503
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,599
always investigate hits always report

1504
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:54,960
both hits

1505
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,040
and sees them to the appropriate

1506
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,880
location

1507
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,160
even if you don't have enough evidence

1508
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,400
for a court case most likely there is

1509
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,400
sufficient ground for dismissal of the

1510
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,440
employee involved or sanctions

1511
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,079
also a golden rule never expose staff to

1512
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,319
non-season there are many good ways to

1513
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:15,599
avoid looking at it for classifications

1514
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,640
second point as we mentioned get iocs

1515
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,359
put them in mist for whatever you have

1516
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:24,160
detect block this kind of content

1517
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,119
right the cost should be zero

1518
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,960
this is such an important issue and in

1519
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,200
terms of security operation the cost for

1520
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,720
you should be zero

1521
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,399
so

1522
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,319
no sound

1523
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:41,440
we can do

1524
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,680
to defend ourselves alone

1525
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,839
we need each of you to act

1526
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:49,599
so thank you very much if you would like

1527
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,240
more um information or contact points

1528
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,599
you can flash code this or go to this

1529
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,839
url and we have a few minutes for four

1530
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,520
questions now so let's take them from

1531
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,520
the floor first and then we'll do a few

1532
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,119
after

1533
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,599
of the machine

1534
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,839
thank you and apologies i didn't scan

1535
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:08,319
the qr code quick enough android core

1536
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:12,880
mac disk um more than 20 years ago i

1537
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,359
worked with uk home office and law

1538
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:16,640
enforcement

1539
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,160
to get a provision in uk law

1540
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,760
that allowed

1541
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,520
sysadmins to

1542
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,599
take forensic backups in these

1543
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,400
circumstances and not be seen as

1544
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,040
immediately committing a crime

1545
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,720
the big concern

1546
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:37,200
was that any kind of

1547
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,200
it was said loophole

1548
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,480
would be used by abusers

1549
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,960
so how do you

1550
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,640
go and establish contact with the police

1551
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,280
in a way that says no i really am a good

1552
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,799
guy i am not an abuser pretending to be

1553
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:56,160
a good guy

1554
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,640
um so what you know how do you actually

1555
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,559
go to the police and say look i need to

1556
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,079
work with you

1557
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:06,760
as a collaborator not as a suspect

1558
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,200
yeah i i i don't mind i mean from you

1559
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,559
what about from your side of the defense

1560
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,799
i know from my side of defense so

1561
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:15,359
from our sides uh really life was much

1562
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,839
easier when we started building informal

1563
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:20,799
cooperation with law enforcement for any

1564
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:22,559
type of crime

1565
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,720
and then we could introduce csm as well

1566
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,960
and they were very helpful so now

1567
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,920
anytime i encounter sorry encounter some

1568
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,559
suspicious material i don't look at it i

1569
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,480
go to the local police office i meet the

1570
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,000
guys and say well can you tell me is

1571
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,599
this illegal in this jurisdiction and

1572
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,480
they can tell me yes or no and having a

1573
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,760
having a relationship with your local

1574
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,079
law enforcement is a very good idea uh

1575
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,720
and okay you could be

1576
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,440
the one in 500 uh person of course you

1577
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,720
could but

1578
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,960
acting in good faith will never be seen

1579
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,480
in a negative way by either law

1580
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,920
enforcement or the courts never i i wish

1581
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,880
um and so and the other update make you

1582
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,480
said nothing

1583
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,280
things below five are not illegal

1584
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,520
that's very jurisdiction specific oh are

1585
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,280
you agreeing

1586
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,720
most of them i may have said the word

1587
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,559
generally before i said something just

1588
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,720
don't anybody in the audience

1589
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,480
don't rely on that yeah no no no no

1590
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,799
please i i totally agree with you

1591
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,960
but what what happens is there is so

1592
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,720
much content out there between six and

1593
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,520
ten that we tend not to ignore one to

1594
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,480
five

1595
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,400
but we use it as indicative rather than

1596
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,359
illegal

1597
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:30,640
that's the point

1598
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,960
okay so it's generally not illegal but

1599
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,880
but regardless of jurisdiction whenever

1600
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,640
i contacted law enforcement because of

1601
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,400
the case they were always very

1602
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,640
supportive sometimes busy and it was

1603
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,880
still frustrating because of length of

1604
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,040
you know court cases and everything but

1605
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,440
always supportive and a key point is one

1606
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,359
to five is an indication

1607
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:50,960
of a sexual interest in children that

1608
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,520
you don't want in your business

1609
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,119
go ahead

1610
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:56,400
good morning

1611
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,280
first of all thank you for the

1612
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,280
presentation i think it's important that

1613
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,400
we uh

1614
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,160
raise and continue to raise the flag and

1615
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,799
the alarm within the cyber security um i

1616
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,880
don't really have a question for

1617
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,559
you specifically but i have a question

1618
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,480
for the audience here

1619
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,079
um how many of you are isc squared cissp

1620
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:15,680
or other certified or credentialed

1621
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,160
people raise your hands

1622
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,240
okay i'm just going to simply remember

1623
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,200
remind you that as a cissp

1624
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,520
we have a can and a code of ethics the

1625
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,760
safety and welfare of society and the

1626
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,920
common good duty to principles into each

1627
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,000
other those are our principles that we

1628
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,200
live by as a cissp or isc squared

1629
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,920
protecting being involved making sure

1630
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,079
that your infrastructure is not being

1631
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:42,640
used for csam or other exploitation is

1632
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,079
as far as i'm concerned with regards to

1633
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,720
that code of canon is part of our job

1634
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,200
holding that certification so we have a

1635
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,200
moral and ethical obligation to be out

1636
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,599
there working with law enforcement and

1637
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:55,680
doing proper incident response

1638
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,599
point number two i just want to quickly

1639
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,480
ask is when it comes to a work

1640
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,559
environment you talked earlier on about

1641
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:03,839
the

1642
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,079
contractor that was coming in would it

1643
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:07,760
not be appropriate

1644
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,640
for in your legal terms to engage that

1645
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,359
contract a contractor organization to

1646
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,520
have in your terms and conditions that

1647
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,480
if you your organization detects some

1648
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,520
sort of csam that you will take action

1649
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,760
directly and that that's part of your

1650
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,480
hiring requirements for that contractor

1651
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,839
maybe that's something we need to figure

1652
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:30,240
out what that legal language needs to be

1653
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,920
and get the legal beagles to put that

1654
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,839
into the agreement and i would say the

1655
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:35,520
same for acceptable user policies for

1656
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,599
your staff exactly thank you gentlemen

1657
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,359
thank you you're perfectly right indeed

1658
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:40,559
okay i'm just going to take one off the

1659
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:42,079
phone uh

1660
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:44,079
so

1661
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,000
owning csam on your device is considered

1662
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,040
illegal how does a task force team

1663
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,799
collect evidences of this crime

1664
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,960
so i mean how do you make sure that the

1665
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,319
the evidence you collect can be used in

1666
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:57,839
court right yeah well my argument is

1667
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:58,960
that you need to be thinking

1668
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,799
forensically from the from the second

1669
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:03,839
you are aware yeah so this is like any

1670
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:05,440
other type of crime when law enforcement

1671
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,760
is involved you do your best and usually

1672
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,880
um you know the judge isn't stupid and

1673
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,880
it works but i can tell you in 30

1674
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,359
seconds another anecdote i had um so

1675
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,440
there was uh one day we had a report

1676
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,359
from one of the season together and it's

1677
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,520
um apparently a young welder that's

1678
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,799
coming very early in the office every

1679
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:25,280
day and downloading csm so spend your

1680
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,280
details but spare the details but we

1681
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,119
have an operation with law enforcement

1682
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:30,400
they have to come in the office of the

1683
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,880
person and when the laptop is unlocked

1684
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,040
they will just arrest him and take the

1685
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,400
hard drive and do the investigation

1686
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,960
classic um but

1687
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,720

know

1705
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,119
and the suspect is like a bit dazzled by

1706
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:12,480
all the police and 10 people in his

1707

1716
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:30,720

1717
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,720
so login and he's logging in and he's

1718
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,920
like where are you where are you going

1719
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,280
when you're going on this website and

1720
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,200
well i'm usually clicking go kick there

1721
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,119
and it's pushing the suspect and i'm

1722
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,280
like okay he's destroying this case

1723
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,440
what an idiot

1724
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,599
but within five minutes

1725
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,040
he managed to push a suspect in a

1726
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,880
position where he admitted that he went

1727
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,640
onto his website he logged in he had

1728
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,240
access to the profile that was suspect

1729
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,079
suspected it

1730
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,880
the personal details was perfectly

1731
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,480
matching he knew about everything and he

1732
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,520
admitted

1733
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,680
so he had a court legal representative

1734
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,359
in the room and he had basically a

1735
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,280
confession live

1736
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,640
from the suspect that's the police

1737
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:07,920
officer that's his job yeah you don't

1738
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,760
worry about his job you you worry about

1739
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,119
your job and your job is to keep it

1740
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:12,799
forensically sound until he gets there

1741
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,400
so the hard drive was like a nice plum

1742
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,960
but the guy here in front his name is

1743
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,839
ted right he's responsible for talks

1744
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:22,160
because his name is ted yep all right

1745
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,319
and and he says we've got five minutes

1746
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:26,079
left but that was about a minute ago

1747
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:28,640
okay okay

1748
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,440
thank you for the

1749
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,240
sobering presentation um

1750
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,359
as a

1751
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,200
an investigator

1752
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,559
um

1753
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:41,520
you said well always investigate

1754
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,000
but he also said

1755
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,559
don't expose your stuff

1756
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:47,839
and

1757
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:49,599
yeah i know i don't want to expose

1758
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:53,280
myself but now how do i make sure

1759
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,559
that they will not

1760
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:58,319
inadvertently be exposed because they

1761
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,240
will be investigating

1762
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,680
and as there's also unknown csam

1763
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:04,720
so

1764
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,839
what do i do with these guys when i get

1765
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,240
them completely traumatized

1766
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,559
because they investigated a case

1767
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,319
so whenever

1768
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:15,599
you're involved in the case looking at

1769
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,359
pictures you know even for simply for

1770
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:18,799
privacy reasons usually people don't

1771
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:19,920
look or when you investigate you don't

1772
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,520
look at the pictures if you suspect this

1773
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,520
is a system case in particular you don't

1774
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,960
want to look at the pictures

1775
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,480
so you have to be very careful there are

1776
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,920
tools you can use to not display

1777
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,119
pictures like you can configure web

1778
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,440
browser to not display pictures and just

1779
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,280
work based on hashes and file system

1780
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,880
timestamps the thing you might be

1781
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,599
exposed to is file names and that's can

1782
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:39,520
be traumatizing as well and so you have

1783
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,960
to be prepared

1784
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,680
but images and videos if you're prepared

1785
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,599
in advance this type of cases you can

1786
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:46,960
really have an environment where the

1787
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,440
whole team can feel safe

1788
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,680
