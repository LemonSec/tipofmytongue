00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,159
in brazil we are seeing a lot

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,439
a very

37
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,920
growing

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,240
cases of frauds just you have

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,200
some

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,079
some numbers in mind we have four

41
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,159
frauds

42
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,240
per second in brazil

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,439
so

44
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,600
now we are talking here and we are

45
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,439
having a lot of frauds

46
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,640
uh it's very important to to tell

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,600
to you

48
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,920
that in 2020 brazil starts speaks

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,680
pix is a

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,880
initiative for our central bank to allow

51
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,920
people

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,680
to transfer money directly peer-to-peer

53
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,920
so and and now we have more than 110

54
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,079
millions of brazilians that use these

55
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,280
systems

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,120
and we have more than 1 billion 1.4

57
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,000
billion of transactions per day so it's

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,080
a huge

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,440
use of this kind of services and and

60
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,520
together with this we have

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,680
a lot of challenge to protect our

62
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,400
finances institut institutions

63
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,280
so we are seeing a lot of

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,280
uh

65
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,040
criminal change

66
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,720
during the pandemic

67
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,519
now the the

68
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,440
the criminal are doing kidnapping in the

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,720
streets and force people to use their

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,680
phones to change to to transfer money

71
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,239
so it's very very difficult to us

72
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,959
to protect and to

73
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,160
to make

74
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,200
or our community safer

75
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,760
and as everybody here is know we have a

76
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,720
lack

77
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,000
of skills

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,840
uh and almost

79
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,800
10 percent of this lack is

80
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,640
based on brazil

81
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,239
that means that we have more than

82
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,360
400 000

83
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,159
open jobs to service security in your

84
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,120
market

85
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,040
so now i will

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,040
incident response so

107
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,000
i'm i will start

108
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,599
this conversation about

109
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,560
what happens on timeline of incident

110
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,639
for uh for

111
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,320
being clearly here

112
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
and after this

113
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,240
we're gonna deep dive on incident

114
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,680
technically

115
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,639
so

116
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,400
this incident uh

117
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,280
is what i can call

118
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,240
or a

119
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,320
christmas gift

120
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,880
this is the i start on the christmas

121
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,080
night

122
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,120
so

123
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,720
we receive

124
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,160
a request from our customer

125
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,720
that oh we have our we identify one of

126
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,720
our customers identify some fake url

127
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,320
and open a request that we start analyze

128
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,440
then

129
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,680
so

130
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,759
this is a fake bank website a fake url

131
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,880
that is normal used to receive some

132
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,680
phishings and uh do some website

133
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,479
impersonate internet banking portal okay

134
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,759
until then

135
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,520
uh but when we start to look in to this

136
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,680
instant when we start to look after this

137
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,840
fake url

138
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,720
uh we we see some

139
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,560
some things different from normal

140
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,520
phishing or normal fake urls

141
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,320
when the customers put the information

142
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,039
on the fake url

143
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,360
the the fake url bank site returns all

144
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,080
the real information from your bank

145
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,360
account

146
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,280
what's possible

147
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,520
how

148
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,880
these guys so so

149
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,080
this is turn more difficult to identify

150
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,600
because the fake url have a ssl

151
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,039
certificate

152
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,759
uh just the name is not the the real

153
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,240
name of the bank but uh

154
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,759
the guys

155
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,080
every time the url so

156
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,720
you don't know if if it's reliable or

157
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,520
not

158
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,440
and when you put your information you

159
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,759
receive all your transactions real time

160
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,840
you see your extract you see your bank

161
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,759
account how many

162
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,280
money you have

163
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,240
so

164
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,800
this is not real

165
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,600
and

166
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,039
after this we understand that this fake

167
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,800
url

168
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,520
in the same day we understand this the

169
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,880
fake url

170
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,800
uh has some some such of access on the

171
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,639
original bank site original api original

172
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,400
information of the bank

173
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,319
so this is is much deeper than we

174
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,960
usually see on the fishings

175
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,120
and after this we start to see on scene

176
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,560
try to find some abnormalized behavior

177
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,000
and

178
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,319
try to see

179
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,199
if we we can see some different to to

180
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,199
get some attacker or some behavior

181
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,680
different so we start to look at the cn

182
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,479
and

183
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,400
we see some unauthorized credential

184
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,880
do some access directly to the api of

185
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,000
the bank

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,199
on the internal environment

187
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,039
so that's the point

188
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,160
this guy

189
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,400
get the information on real bank through

190
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,599
the api

191
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,120
and

192
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,919
uh push then this information to the

193
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,520
fake url so

194
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,080
i need to investigate this this attacker

195
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,680
or this credential

196
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,010
so

197
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,440
[Music]

198
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,319
after uh validate that this credential

199
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,280
it's a valid credential from the

200
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,919
the bank from some some professional

201
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,360
from the bank

202
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,400
and

203
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,240
we start to think that this condition

204
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,120
was on it so for this this guy is using

205
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,440
this credential get this information

206
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
real time on api

207
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,960
through the internal environment of the

208
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,160
bank and push then to the fake url

209
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,639
turned in more uh more difficult to

210
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,639
identify the fraud

211
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,599
so

212
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,319
we

213
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,680
do

214
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,759
we block we did

215
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,479
we blocked the communication at the edge

216
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,520
so

217
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,639
we immediately uh identify

218
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,400
this this user

219
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,919
this professional user disability

220
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,680
credential from the

221
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,440
bank side

222
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,319
and we we blocked this communication we

223
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,759
blocked them on a

224
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,799
active director so

225
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,479
after this we

226
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,039
try to authenticate again on a fake url

227
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,679
and we see that he stopped to

228
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,839
authentication all the

229
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,360
the users so the fake url is stopped to

230
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,880
push information

231
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,480
real time so

232
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,600
we understand that we found the attacker

233
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
we found the valid credentials that get

234
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,040
this information and

235
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,240
push to

236
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,720
then then real side so

237
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,480
uh after this uh we start

238
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,920
to see

239
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,040
until

240
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,200
we do the counter attack

241
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,519
we start to see uh

242
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,120
what lateral movement that this

243
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,080
uh this guy doing with this valid

244
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,279
credential we see that it's not some

245
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,800
some

246
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,720
some things in other machines other

247
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,519
hosts or or that's not infected other

248
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,519
other machines or something like that

249
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,640
there's not any any uh

250
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,440
any valid credential uh

251
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,920
used by by the attackers and

252
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,640
after this blocking this communication

253
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,959
we see the fake url is just a fake url

254
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,200
without any information sensitive

255
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,279
information so

256
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,040
we start to do

257
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,640
the counter attack

258
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,600
why

259
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,040
counter attack

260
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,240
because we need to understand

261
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,800
how many data this attacker is stolen

262
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,200
how many data these attackers

263
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,680
how many customers from the bank these

264
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,920
attackers get this information

265
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,200
for doing the incident response and not

266
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,560
just block the active director user who

267
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,800
was infected or around it

268
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,000
but

269
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,839
to change the password and block

270
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,079
accounts of all these customers had

271
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,040
been stolen by this this fraud

272
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,560
so for these

273
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,880
we start to do the counter measures

274
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,440
because we we need to understand the

275
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,079
whole thing

276
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,079
and

277
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,079
understanding the whole thing

278
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,040
that's the big deal it's not one

279
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,079
bank

280
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,000
it's not just our customer it's not

281
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,680
directly

282
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,440
uh attack

283
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,760
it's indirectly attacked so it's more

284
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,880
than 15 brands that harmed

285
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,120
by the same attackers

286
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,440
the same fraud group

287
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,040
and

288
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,640
that's the thing start to

289
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,440
to be more interesting here all the

290
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,200
sites uh all the brands all these after

291
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,399
on the server we

292
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,360
we own it with css uh success the the

293
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,000
server of attacker on amazon

294
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,600
aws

295
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
and an ec2

296
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,160
and get all the brains that suffer that

297
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,880
harm about this this we found you a

298
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,399
porto

299
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,000
that you can with some few clicks

300
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,959
like

301
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,120
five or six clicks

302
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,600
you can create a new fishing

303
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,399
with this portal with this portal fraud

304
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,440
portal

305
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,000
not you can create a new fishings for

306
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,959
this

307
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,680
15 brands but

308
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,959
you also can do the cdn

309
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,639
you can also

310
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,760
have all the infrastructure prepared

311
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,560
to

312
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,000
you you don't need to to know how

313
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,959
uh

314
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,000
um

315
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,800
get up to a fake url you just need to

316
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,399
pay for

317
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,399
give them this

318
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,560
access of this portal

319
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,920
to do this uh so it's a kind of fishing

320
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,800
on fake url as a service

321
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,399
so you have

322
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,880
in five or six clicks

323
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,959
you can uh

324
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,279
such a a new environment of

325
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,320
with all this the security like a cdn or

326
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,680
things like that

327
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,240
and is is uh

328
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,160
too fast

329
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,360
that

330
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,800
you cannot do proact leave search

331
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,079
for for indeed to fight this url because

332
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,560
this url starts

333
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,079
this morning

334
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,399
and you start to do the frauds at the

335
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,040
same time so you don't have the the

336
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,360
range time to to identify them until

337
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,320
they start to do the frauds

338
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,519
so this is bigger

339
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,639
uh

340
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,800
when we we do the counter measures and

341
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,000
we gain access to the server of attacker

342
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,720
we uh the first thing that we we do

343
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,440
you see that past three days here

344
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,560
uh we give three days for

345
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,920
for can can gain access to

346
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,160
almost three days to gain access to the

347
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,240
attacker environment the first thing

348
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,480
that we we do we did

349
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,839
uh is ensuring access guarantee uh that

350
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,680
we stay connected and even if this guy

351
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,959
uh

352
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,000
look at

353
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,399
these credentials of of the server and

354
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,440
see their own at you

355
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,959
we ensure the evidence so

356
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,199
we not do any change on the attacker

357
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,519
environment we just

358
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,880
downloaded all the data of the server

359
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,839
to analyze on our environment

360
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,839
so we we didn't change anything we

361
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,959
see we've seen the frauds passing by but

362
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,560
we cannot do

363
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,760
we cannot do anything because if we do

364
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,800
right now

365
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,279
and to understand the whole thing

366
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,680
this guy just dropped off this the

367
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,560
server just shut down and start a new

368
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,360
one

369
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,240
so we are we're gonna lose all

370
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,880
the the things that we gain access we

371
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,959
gain access to the data of the attacker

372
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,199
so we didn't change anything we just

373
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,480
seen the routes passing by

374
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,040
and start to understand a little bit

375
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,920
more and analyze to to stop this this

376
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,160
fraudster group

377
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,320
so after ensure the evidence and

378
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,199
download all the data that this attacker

379
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,120
have of this this more than 15 brands

380
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,560
we start to do the recover so we ensure

381
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,240
the customers that are affected by this

382
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,079
fraud have this password reset

383
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,680
immediately

384
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,440
and inform

385
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,519
do this this

386
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,360
uh report

387
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,480
uh

388
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,639
with the all these brands all the banks

389
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,000
all the agreements so

390
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,040
to help the not just our customer but

391
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,040
it's a kind of responsible disclosure

392
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,279
here

393
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,560
uh

394
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,279
we start to see about lessons learned

395
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,560
and

396
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,959
we create some ways

397
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,720
to identify more quickly and faster

398
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,880
this kind of behavior

399
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,240
that is not usually a normal fishing but

400
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,320
it's a combined attack

401
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,680
so we create some rules on scene

402
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,079
to trying to trigger that that's this

403
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,639
other you know real time so we we get

404
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,720
more easily

405
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,920
and we did responsible disclosure that

406
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,120
ensure

407
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,320
that all the the companies involved uh

408
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,480
and authorities like the police

409
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,320
department has notified about this case

410
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,519
so

411
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,920
uh i tell you the timeline

412
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,639
to

413
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,160
to much easier understand

414
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,120
the attack here

415
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,000
this attack it's

416
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,320
such a different attack it's a combined

417
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,279
attack

418
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,920
so we start with the fake url

419
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,399
the fake bank sites

420
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,399
uh the customer

421
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,279
uh

422
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,600
that get it through phishing

423
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,680
go through internet

424
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,000
authenticate on the fake bank site the

425
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,920
fake bank site return

426
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,839
the actual account information of the

427
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,320
user account balance transactions

428
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,040
uh that make different difficult to to

429
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,399
identify

430
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,720
uh here they stolen identity accounts

431
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,320
password credit cards secured key cards

432
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,600
pictures of this guy with these ideas to

433
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,120
do the sprouts

434
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,240
and

435
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,279
almost

436
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,000
uh ten hundred ten thousand

437
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
customers has been harmed

438
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,398
about

439
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,760
this fraud

440
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,039
so this attacker was gaining

441
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,359
the access to the internal environment

442
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,720
of the bank

443
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,599
and

444
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,119
get this

445
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,760
information real time to the api

446
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,720
automated it's like a sewer

447
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,319
for for attackers and they they get the

448
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,319
the database

449
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,039
they get this fraud dashboard uh this

450
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,400
this guy is called anubis the egyptian

451
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,520
god

452
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,320
yeah

453
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,960
uh these guys are knowing on brazil and

454
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,760
latin not just in brazil but portugal

455
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,480
and

456
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,200
spainchu

457
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,760
and through the

458
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,600
valley the credential

459
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,000
the access to the the real environment

460
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,160
they push that real information through

461
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,919
the fake bank sites

462
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,880
but when we start to identify the older

463
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,960
brands and other attacks we also

464
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,840
identify a malware hat

465
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,880
on our exact table that's not the bank

466
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,360
from our customer is different

467
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
but

468
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,520
some banks this guy had the access

469
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,919
internal access they gained valley

470
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,720
credentials some banks this guy had

471
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,200
malware so this guy do

472
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,080
do your best did your best here

473
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,280
trying to

474
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,160
to figure out a lot of ways to do frauds

475
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,679
on these brains

476
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,960
so this is a financial group route a big

477
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,080
one

478
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,600
so

479
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,320
this is uh attacker user panel real-time

480
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,039
fraud panel add new domains deploy cdn

481
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,799
with few clicks like i said to you

482
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,799
so what is different from this uh

483
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,600
usually normal fishing and this this one

484
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,400
uh normal fishing usually uh

485
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,799
steal credit shows perform fraud with

486
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,919
stolen customer data here we have some

487
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,799
still company credentials we have

488
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,200
the a program that that uh uh uh

489
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,400
create this bank site with few clicks we

490
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,320
have an online fraud dashboard

491
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,960
showing all the information

492
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,640
that the customers that have been harmed

493
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,720
and the values that the customer had

494
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,919
been harmed

495
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,919
and each time how many times this

496
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,919
customer has been harmed

497
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,720
so uh online authentication through the

498
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,559
apis

499
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,320
sure after this

500
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,720
the bank was closed at the api though is

501
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,120
it identify the open ports you know open

502
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,160
uh open windows that they click close

503
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,039
and

504
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:39,919
uh

505
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,720
they this authenticate api was not

506
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,360
it's possible anymore but it's a kind of

507
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,160
mis-configuration on the on the

508
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,679
bank app

509
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,080
so in returns the real information so

510
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,840
this is a combined efficient that's the

511
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,000
or we are different from

512
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,320
one each other

513
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,200
so this is uh online fraud this is a

514
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,520
picture from this is a print for this is

515
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,080
online fraud that you can see it's in

516
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,679
portuguese but

517
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,039
uh you can see the value here in urease

518
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,039
or

519
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,360
armani uh you can see the customer uh

520
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,360
push it and out

521
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,919
you can see the wrong password here

522
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:22,960
uh

523
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,760
asking again the password

524
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,000
we have here

525
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,120
not susan's transaction we have here

526
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,600
almost uh

527
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,799
i'm say 500 dollars here

528
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,440
and waiting for for customer

529
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,520
uh

530
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,240
plain text your your sms or your

531
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,480
password or something like that uh we

532
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,760
have here some some values but

533
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,960
and we have time time stamp here too

534
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,480
so this is it's too faster

535
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,640
than a lot of money has been stolen on

536
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,600
this christmas night here

537
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,080
so the combination of different attacks

538
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,120
make this attack more effective

539
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,600
so effective so the niche targeted

540
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,840
phishing is not a single company

541
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,960
so

542
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,720
get customer credentials company

543
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,720
credentials access to the internal bank

544
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,400
site

545
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,200
these attackers use a kind of secured

546
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,679
posture using cdn content to deliver

547
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,880
network to mask original api ip address

548
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,000
and

549
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,080
protect you into the dos or something

550
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,679
like that

551
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,280
so

552
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,480
the time

553
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,480
between the registration of a new domain

554
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,799
and the start of this campaign

555
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,440
it's very short that

556
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,760
makes difficult to identify and do

557
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,320
something proactively

558
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,600
uh we have here more than 15

559
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,080
financial institutions

560
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,360
acquires banks and other

561
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,080
we have some e-commerce too but it's

562
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,200
it's little than than the others

563
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,080
we have more than 10 000 customers

564
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,720
affected by this road

565
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,240
more than uh

566
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,360
14 email domains

567
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,440
was been between leaked

568
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,200
domains

569
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
and we also

570
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,679
found some malware active effects for

571
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,000
one of these banks

572
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
so

573
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,440
imagine the the loss of this customer

574
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,120
confidence

575
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,679
using a digital means of payment or

576
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,559
account management

577
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,480
so

578
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,280
we do the malware analysis sandbox

579
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,640
and

580
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,960
statute key analysis of

581
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,640
desired effect

582
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,000
and here

583
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,400
you can see the severity the confidence

584
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,919
of this malware

585
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,080
we see that

586
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,679
they install

587
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,840
they open some ports

588
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,280
they delete on the table file directors

589
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,520
to trying to

590
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,440
to not have some logs

591
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,720
that

592
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,880
makes more difficult to identify

593
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,200
we have the process mod file in the

594
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,000
files director we have the certified

595
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,840
database for

596
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,880
the

597
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,640
firefox and other browsers was modified

598
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,120
we see that the sample was largely the

599
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,440
copper of you say itself

600
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,000
and so this is a a mower hat so this is

601
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,840
this is a financial

602
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,039
malware specifically

603
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,440
uh we start to look at not just the

604
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,919
sandbox and more analysis but we start

605
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,640
to look the artifact the ssl the the

606
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,880
certificate that was being

607
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,000
uh placed by these ones and you we can

608
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,919
see the difference here

609
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,000
this one is the the original one

610
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,360
this one is the fake one

611
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,200
so

612
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,120
we can see the difference from the

613
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,320
install

614
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,679
install

615
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,320
path and we can see the difference for

616
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,320
here's the false

617
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,240
so we have the

618
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,200
shawan md5 we also shared all these iocs

619
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,039
through the misp more information

620
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,720
sharing platform

621
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,080
with the network or network so

622
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,600
our community

623
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,400
uh

624
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,520
we have here uh warsaw where so it's a

625
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,919
software that uh i think almost all the

626
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:28,880
banks

627
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,559
not just in brazil but in other

628
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,679
countries

629
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,960
that have this registry uh to to

630
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,919
guarantee that's not the app of the bank

631
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:38,880
it's not

632
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,760
uh

633
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,919
gonna hack it so

634
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,720
this war saw is used so

635
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,039
like a protection system until you

636
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,159
install

637
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,120
your app of your bank so

638
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,120
uh sometimes you install your app of the

639
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,760
your bank and these were so

640
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,159
install into the app

641
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,919
install first and we see that smaller

642
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,919
was a change

643
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,240
the register and

644
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,440
the this information from

645
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,360
this software that

646
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,840
use it to prove to provide

647
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,520
for these apps

648
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,360
so

649
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,760
uh in here

650
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,760
after this analysis all these analysis

651
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,570
this environment this uh we start to

652
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,840
[Music]

653
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,039
uh um sum up some steps to do with this

654
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,000
incident like we did uh

655
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,720
with for our sock team

656
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,640
so the preparation

657
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,320
know and monitor your customers just

658
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,039
basically but it's important

659
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,640
yeah

660
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,120
critical servers networks applications

661
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,760
and end points it's better that you get

662
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,320
logs of all these things because when

663
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,760
you need to see on the cn it's

664
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,720
it's too late to start to put the logs

665
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,840
in so you need the logs right now so

666
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,240
uh the level of importance and priority

667
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,520
of the assets of your your customers is

668
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,600
better that you know because

669
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,760
you see that some assets it's more

670
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,760
critically impacted uh than others so

671
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,559
it's important to to understand

672
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,039
uh when you you need to give more more

673
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,240
focus so create baseline in standards to

674
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,880
be using features and comparisons of

675
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,200
this these customers

676
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,360
determine the security events

677
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,440
and set the three shows

678
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,279
and do the lessons learned create

679
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,200
another rules and and do this pgca plan

680
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,240
do shaky acting just

681
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,480
every time and create a communication

682
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,320
plan if you don't have a communication

683
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,240
plan when you have a critical incident

684
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,840
you cannot

685
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,600
follow these steps

686
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,679
to

687
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,720
so

688
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,480
after do the preparation of this

689
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,080
incident we start to do the detection

690
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,360
and analysis

691
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,080
so identification of the attacker

692
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,279
accounts

693
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,240
logs behaviors uh

694
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,480
to understand the whole thing

695
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,960
uh determine the entry point

696
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,679
of

697
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,919
this fraud of this attacker

698
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,880
how can can we get access through here

699
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,919
uh

700
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,840
that's supposed to be not access here in

701
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,720
this environment internal uh determine

702
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
the extent of the breach in the

703
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,399
understand the whole thing

704
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,200
uh and do your homework do the the

705
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,799
things that you need to do the hard

706
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,640
things that you need to do block the ad

707
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,399
accounts uh trying to to find uh if you

708
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,799
need to isolate some network that is

709
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,039
affected you need to do

710
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,360
uh until the those things

711
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,399
scan bigger

712
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,919
uh

713
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,279
you can do you need to do you should do

714
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,159
containment eradication and recover

715
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,840
so this work to do

716
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,200
you start to stop and not just stop but

717
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,480
to see that it's not a lateral movement

718
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,360
or something like the

719
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,440
that you don't reliable anymore in this

720
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,159
environment so stop the bleeding fix the

721
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,480
tread energy entry point remove the

722
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,960
treads and guarantee

723
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,279
and to resume this operation

724
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,000
that you are free from attackers on your

725
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,039
environment

726
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,520
is uh

727
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,960
important

728
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,880
then it's more important than resume

729
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,200
your operation we understand that when

730
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,600
our operations were stopped the money

731
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,480
was lost and we were trying to figure

732
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,000
out and try to

733
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,559
imagine that you are lost money

734
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,440
after second and you want to resume your

735
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,799
operation but

736
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,480
uh

737
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,600
you

738
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,320
you need to ensure that your environment

739
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,600
was reliable and you do resume this

740
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,919
operation and service

741
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,240
so the post incident achieved

742
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,279
uh

743
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,760
lessons learned a new rules and seeing

744
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,399
to identify more easier

745
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,880
do the pdca cycle

746
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,440
use your efforts and results to rise

747
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,840
phones is too important

748
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,440
because

749
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,919
if you're not using the situation this

750
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,240
critical instinct to raise funds

751
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,679
with your board

752
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,440
you may

753
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,240
lose the time to do that

754
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,720
and prepare for the next attacks because

755
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,360
you think your stop was stopped

756
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,080
i think you you are wrong

757
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,120
so we we need to be prepared for the

758
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,559
next ones

759
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,799
so

760
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,760
about countermeasures uh

761
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,840
identify the attackers

762
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,159
search inside the internet

763
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,799
publicly paid intelligence feeds through

764
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,880
this this nickname

765
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,600
to the noobs uh list the

766
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,240
autocorrelations that you find about

767
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,520
disguise

768
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,240
understand the structure of the attacker

769
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,240
is extremely important

770
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,559
analyze that traffic and url codes

771
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,080
identify the

772
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,919
code call apis in the credential was use

773
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,080
it to get didn't push this information

774
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,200
on a fake

775
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,679
url

776
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,720
the credentials was encrypted here

777
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,480
that's some

778
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,120
some cryptography but basically uh

779
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,360
when uh

780
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,679
you attack you you can try to inject

781
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,399
some comments or codes like like they

782
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,480
they do with us

783
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,039
i always see this is the most important

784
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,640
one

785
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,799
always see the logs in the rear horse

786
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,200
because we get

787
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,159
how we honor the attacker

788
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,320
to see the locks

789
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,200
we get

790
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,600
the the password

791
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,200
and we get the logging

792
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,600
of the situ of the attacker

793
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,080
in the log errors that's human important

794
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,840
to do this

795
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,200
and always remember to use a vpn or mask

796
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,000
in your ip when you do counter attack

797
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,640
not doing these not this

798
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,000
uh with

799
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,080
in in your environment

800
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,279
or in the environment of the your course

801
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,919
for our customers don't do that use

802
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,200
a machine separately of your environment

803
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,480
and mask all your ips and vpns and

804
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,399
everything that you can

805
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,519
to not

806
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,720
uh

807
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,279
not possible to not enable the attacker

808
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,840
to do the reverse engineer

809
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,559
so

810
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,320
this is the screen the profile of this

811
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,279
attacker we have batman here too

812
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,679
in the wrong side we have a noobs we

813
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,480
have maurer this is some some profiles

814
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,320
that guys that not

815
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,360
no don't have this know-how and just

816
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,360
uh both the

817
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,080
access here

818
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,159
so

819
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,360
uh

820
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,679
closer by skill in the zero day industry

821
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:02,640
so

822
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,440
do the responsible disclosure when you

823
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,480
can

824
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,240
share the information with the community

825
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,720
and i'm not doing this alone

826
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,440
i don't think anyone do

827
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,799
nothing alone

828
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,960
i'm representing here my team

829
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,360
not just entity but my team

830
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,720

currently on my team and this guy's

833
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,600
helped me to do this this attack

834
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,880
so value your people your teamwork

835
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,360
have a multi-disciplinary team because

836
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,399
here we have we need to to

837
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,240
to pass through to face off through this

838
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,840
incident we need some

839
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,960
some devsecops guys we need some

840
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,799
red team guys we need some bluetooth

841
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,559
guys so it's

842
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,919
it's a lot of

843
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,399
professionals required to do

844
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,960
uh through this incident so have

845
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,120
autonomy and trust are important if

846
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,320
you're not trusting all your your team

847
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,519
you cannot achieve this this kind of

848
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,720
instincts

849
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,600
and do what your love stick take a lot

850
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,720
less work

then especially with your transparency

863
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,039
of this incident that you guys worked on

864
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,919
so um i think we have time for maybe one

865
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,519
question if there's there's a microphone

866
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:50,720
at each end

867
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,799
first customer right here all right hey

868
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,880
