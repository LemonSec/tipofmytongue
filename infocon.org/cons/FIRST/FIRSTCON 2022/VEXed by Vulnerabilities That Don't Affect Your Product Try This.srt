1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,480
all right guys we'll get started with

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,719
the next session here up next we have a

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,480
presentation vexed by vulnerabilities

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,960
that don't affect your product try this

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,199
this is by alan friedman from cisa and

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,520
thomas schmidt from bsi

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,840
and uh with that i'll just turn it the

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,039
stage over to you guys and we'll get

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,320
started

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,560
tlp white just like the last couple of

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,080
sessions we've had in this room and if

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,760
you have any devices

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,120
please turn those audio indicators off

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,519
okay all yours slides uh-huh

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,120
good morning thanks everyone for

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,840
abandoning your coffee to come up uh

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,719
so very briefly we are uh we nerd

18
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,840
wrangle uh in in various components

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,879
uh

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,440
thomas is uh the ics cowboy if you've

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,280
not seen his uh picture in the program

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,160
he's clearly an emphatically a white hat

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,320
very large white hat uh who's been

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,320
working on the how do we automate

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,600
security in the ot domain uh he actively

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,200
avoids he doesn't just passively avoid

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,760
social media he actively spurns it um

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,479
and he's the lead for csaf um

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,400
i'm happy to say that i know a decent

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
number of you i'm alan i'm the guy who

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,960
doesn't shut up about s-bomb and related

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,799
issues so i'm the the nerd wrangler for

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,479
s-bomb and what we're gonna be talking

34
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,520
about today

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,720
so a couple of caveats uh

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,479
this is something that is still being

37
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,880
cooked up in the lab but

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,960
we think there's plenty that we can

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,759
sample today uh so there's a horrible

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,079
cliche in cyber security of building the

41
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,920
plane while flying it uh that is very

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,000
much the reality here um but one of the

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,960
things that we're going to talk about

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,159
today is actually being used uh and paid

45
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,399
for right there are paying customers who

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,479
are using this today

47
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,079
so what are we talking about today

48
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,560
thomas it's basically

49
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,119
the blow over of lock for shell

50
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,200
so we worked on that before but that

51
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,479
really gave the drive um when we looked

52
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,439
at the vulnerability of lock for shell

53
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,439
and the subsequent ones

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,639
so basically when you have a

55
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,239
vulnerability like

56
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,120
like lock for shell what do you do so

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,120
first of all you need to know

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,360
which of my products are affected and

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,200
what are the mitigations

60
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,319
and

61
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,400
now you need to know where to find that

62
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,319
information and

63
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,120
potential ways to find about

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,720
products at risk or security advisories

65
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,959
you could ask your vendor you could do

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,040
your own investigation or you have a

67
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,360
look at your s1

68
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,879
and it comes if it comes to that um

69
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,800
you want to know how many vendors do you

70
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,040
have since you have to check all of them

71
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,160
and and all of their products so

72
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,080
if we are going to look onto their

73
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,360
websites

74
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,040
um

75
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,959
it probably looks more or less like this

76
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,599
you got a really lot of

77
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,840
websites which you have to go to

78
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,640
but then if we come back to

79
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,040
our potential ways of finding our

80
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,640
products at risk

81
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,720
we see a bunch of problems there

82
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,599
so security advisories yeah

83
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,920
maybe the vendor hasn't issued one

84
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,760
or if he has issued one about

85
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,319
vulnerability is your product in there

86
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,920
is the product that you care about

87
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,440
mentioned in it

88
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,159
um

89
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,239
you could ask the vendor so they love it

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,920
when you call their helplines don't they

91
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,840
they they do totally and you get a

92
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,280
support ticket number and you don't know

93
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,480
what to do

94
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
so still no answer from from the vendor

95
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,879
yet um so maybe you want to start your

96
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,799
own investigation but

97
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,360
just having looked at the slides how

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,080
many vendors you have um that might be

99
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
very time consuming and then the

100
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,120
question is

101
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,480
where do we start

102
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,799
where do we actually prioritize our

103
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,519
products um and and do our own

104
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,840
investigation and not wasting time when

105
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,319
the vendor five minutes later published

106
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,400
the security advisory saying hey i'm

107
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,680
affected

108
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,879
yeah i found it out two days later um so

109
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,040
then the question is about s-bomb do you

110
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,920
have it careful if you have it perfect

111
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,680
and then the question is does it have

112
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,159
enough details if it just have one the

113
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,720
depth of one you might not even see that

114
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,279
there is somewhere in the library that

115
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,320
includes a library in the library

116
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,600
that there is log4j in it

117
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,440
so the question about the number of

118
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,479
vulnerabilities

119
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,479
i can't really answer since you have

120
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,360
today

121
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,800
the vulnerability management is

122
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,759
something you have today do day by day

123
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,720
but i had a look at the cves

124
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,919
and

125
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,400
more or less they are rising i couldn't

126
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,680
say that exponentially or nominal but

127
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,240
they are rising over time we can ask

128
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,479
jono here to do the math for us

129
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,600
so and

130
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,560
also

131
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,840
it's not just the total number of

132
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,680
vulnerabilities it's our awareness of

133
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,360
them so s-bomb is going to tell us

134
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,120
about the maximum number of potential

135
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,960
vulnerabilities as we have more

136
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,360
visibility into our supply chain that is

137
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,039
going to be very helpful for us in the

138
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,520
long run but in the short run it's going

139
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,600
to give us more things to worry about uh

140
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,120
and more things to do now that doesn't

141
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,800
mean that we should ignore it

142
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,560
let the record show that alan is still

143
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,880
solidly s-bomb pro-s-bomb

144
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,280
but we want to make sure that right

145
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,960
we're going to have all this data going

146
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,840
on so what do the folks that are

147
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,720
actually

148
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,080
managing the risk for their customers uh

149
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,360
for their users what do they want today

150
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,800
well

151
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,840
um

152
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,120
s-bomb is definitely something that

153
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,400
everyone wants

154
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,560
but today we may not have the technology

155
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,800
to actually use it and analyze it today

156
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,240
we're working on it it was just an open

157
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
source project that was announced

158
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,320
called daggerboard by a hospital and if

159
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,479
a hospital can learn how to use s-bombs

160
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,400
then surely a lot of the more mature

161
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,880
organizations can as well

162
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,919
but what are the problems we're trying

163
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,479
to solve so basically we have seen the

164
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,039
numbers of vulnerabilities arising

165
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,560
and s-bomb adds to that overload so we

166
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,960
need to solve the problem of scalability

167
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,960
and then we need to solve the problem of

168
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,880
explorability since not every

169
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,039
vulnerability really can be exploited

170
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,919
so

171
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,080
one thing is if we talk about sort of

172
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,840
real vulnerabilities right we want to

173
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,240
focus on the things where bad guys can

174
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,680
do bad things

175
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,600
we're not chasing down vulnerabilities

176
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,680
just for the sheer pleasure of hearing

177
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,919
the bing once you've patched something

178
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,319
right we're actually we need to focus on

179
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,000
protection

180
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,759
we want to minimize the number of things

181
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,919
where we just are uncertain hey is this

182
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,360
vulnerable or not

183
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,440
and we of course eventually want to have

184
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,120
some data so that we can track it

185
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,199
perform it maybe use that dreaded

186
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,280
compliance model

187
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,520
so for talking about what you know bad

188
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,759
guys can do things the traditional model

189
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,520
is exploitability right

190
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,720
cis has announced the known exploitable

191
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,440
vulnerabilities where we say hey these

192
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,720
are the stuff that we know the bad guys

193
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,919
are already using

194
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,680
but as thomas mentioned

195
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,400
not every vulnerability is the same

196
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,160
certainly not when they're baked into a

197
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,039
product

198
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,680
right um so we don't use the term

199
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
exploitable because debating what

200
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,639
exploitable means is roughly as much fun

201
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,039
as debating which text editor is

202
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,039
inherently superior it's emacs by the

203
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,759
way we agree

204
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,199
so um we define this from the user's

205
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,560
perspective thus to say rather than

206
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,039
saying it's exploitable it's am i

207
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,759
affected do i need to do

208
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,440
literally anything

209
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,400
um so the action for being affected

210
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,039
could be i need a patch but it could

211
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,240
also be to verify a setting so when i

212
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,520
sold thomas a blinking box i said do not

213
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,759
under any circumstances plug this

214
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,599
directly into the public internet always

215
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,919
need to sit behind something

216
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,680
if the vulnerability is only exploitable

217
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,520
if the blinking box is published it

218
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,960
plugged in the internet

219
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,560
thomas still needs to go and make sure

220
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,360
that

221
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,960
no one in his team did something very

222
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,919
stupid so that's still a check so we

223
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,240
define affected as do you need to do

224
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,160
little literally anything and that

225
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,039
includes a basic config check

226
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,960
the compliment this is what every

227
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,520
security team wants to know is

228
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,759
i'm not affected i literally don't have

229
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,759
to do anything about this and we'll talk

230
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,960
a little bit about why that might be the

231
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,240
case so at its core they're going to be

232
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,960
vulnerabilities that simply do not

233
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,360
affect a product based on how that code

234
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,440
is used

235
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,799
so

236
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,559
what are we going to call this

237
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,320
we're going to call it vex uh i

238
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
apologize for the dumb name that's my

239
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,399
fault this was a temporary placeholder

240
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,680
name that we used as we were talking

241
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,600
about it and some of you might know that

242
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,519
there's nothing in the world quite so

243
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,480
permanent as a temporary government idea

244
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,720
uh and so we we're sort of stuck with

245
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,160
the name vex um we get lots of puns if

246
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,600
anyone can come with a new one i'll buy

247
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,880
you a beer

248
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,040
then the goal here is to make the

249
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,120
product status explicit

250
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,920
and

251
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,480
more than just saying it explicitly make

252
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,880
it machine readable because again in

253
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,360
2022 if you're building a security

254
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,600
system without aiming towards automation

255
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,240
you're wasting everyone's time

256
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,399
so what are the use cases so we have

257
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,360
seen lock for shell as

258
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,720
and other media hype vulnerabilities and

259
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,800
those where you actually have your ceo

260
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,440
on the line and they are calling you up

261
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,279
in the morning or in evening whenever

262
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,880
they have time

263
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,720
and asking you what's the status which

264
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,399
of our products are at risk what have

265
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,760
you done

266
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
report back immediately

267
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,560
and

268
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,959
then you have to do a lot of work and

269
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,920
still report to your superiors

270
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,399
so it would be easier if you have some

271
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,720
tools that assist you to do that work

272
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,120
um we also have the problem of false

273
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,279
positives in security scanners you know

274
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,480
the open ssl

275
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,680
0.9.8 where it every time reports you oh

276
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,480
that's vulnerable to hot lead but

277
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,560
the hotly function isn't in the product

278
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,360
at all so there is no point

279
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,839
of patching vulnerabilities that aren't

280
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:14,959
even there

281
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,000
and then

282
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,160
you might have an in-depth security

283
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,640
analysis of a product actually looking

284
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,440
into what is there in the product from

285
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,160
the cves i called from the nvd or from

286
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,880
the cve project

287
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,760
so

288
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,040
how do we think about organizing this

289
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,920
well there are a couple of different

290
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,760
ways we're not trying to be explicit and

291
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,600
directive at this stage we think this is

292
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,720
something that we want to find out how

293
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,720
the market's going to use so you could

294
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,279
have this model with one product and one

295
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,560
vulnerability

296
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,320
you can have this product uh you can

297
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,720
have a vex where it references many

298
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,480
products in one vulnerability right this

299
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,640
is the response to you know your log for

300
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,640
j style vulnerability where you just say

301
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,959
hey here's all of my products here's all

302
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,240
the information

303
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,320
and we can also imagine a world where we

304
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
can reference many vulnerabilities about

305
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,720
one product so this could be coming and

306
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,320
i'll talk a little bit more later about

307
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,920
how vexes can come from anywhere anyone

308
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,320
can publish a vex so we can imagine a

309
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
security consultant or a security

310
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,880
service saying hey we've done a teardown

311
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,160
of this you know important plc

312
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,839
and here are the statuses of different

313
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,240
vulnerabilities in that

314
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,120
so

315
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,279
our benefits are clearly we're saving

316
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,760
money so if i can

317
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,399
automatically say to my customers in an

318
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,959
automated fashion machine readable

319
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,480
i'm not affected

320
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,200
go and talk to somebody else then my

321
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,240
hotlines obviously won't be swamped by

322
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,839
calls and my my tickets um my ticket

323
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,560
numbers are rising up and i can do the

324
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,040
work i can even say the customers hey

325
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,360
i'm aware of the vulnerability bear with

326
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,440
me i'm analyzing it

327
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,639
puts out something that says hey i know

328
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,399
about a vulnerability and we are

329
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,160
currently investigating the following

330
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,200
product

331
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,000
so that also reduces the human workload

332
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,240
on both sides so you don't have to call

333
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,399
your vendor anymore um

334
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,200
if you a clean asset inventory and you

335
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,120
know what you have actually so that's

336
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,399
important

337
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,399
then you can actually automatically

338
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,279
match the incoming machine readable

339
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,800
security advisories and vex documents so

340
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,680
just to show you those that really uh

341
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,200
are important to you

342
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,639
now thomas this vex idea sounds amazing

343
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,279
but to implement it i'd have to spend

344
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,519
1990 i mean i'd have to use 19 different

345
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,760
specs right there's no one specification

346
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,519
there's no one data format that can do

347
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,600
all this great work is there there is

348
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,360
actually one and it's called the common

349
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,079
security advisory framework i had the

350
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,959
honor to be one of the editors of that

351
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,600
specification and it really does two

352
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,160
things um it specifies a machine

353
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,399
readable format for security advisories

354
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,399
and a vex is basically a negative

355
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,120
security advisory um telling that

356
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,959
something is not affected is basically

357
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,720
the same like telling something is

358
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,519
affected and putting a not in between

359
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,320
and it also standardizes the way how to

360
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,279
distribute security advisories

361
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,519
it was built already with automation in

362
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,079
mind and it comes with a standardized

363
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,600
toolset so that you can actually say hey

364
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,160
that's the function that i want to have

365
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,399
where are the tools that fulfill this

366
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,200
function and they can claim conformance

367
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,760
against the standard making it easier

368
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,839
for you to find tools

369
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,320
it also has guidance about actional the

370
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,880
information what is actually what needs

371
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,240
to be in that field so that i as a user

372
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,320
can use that

373
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,560
if you have heard of cvrf

374
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,600
it's a successor and it's ready to use

375
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,639
so how does vex play into this

376
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,560
it is a profile in csaf um it specifies

377
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,199
additional mandatory fields and

378
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,360
therefore it can use the same

379
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,320
infrastructure and the same systems and

380
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,600
it is not

381
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,480
mandatory to have s-bombs for bags you

382
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,360
can just have the wax

383
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,320
and

384
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,399
put that out without an s-bone

385
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,680
but

386
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,440
we should probably all use s-bombs just

387
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,720
to be safe right yes yes okay good so uh

388
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,120
what do we need to do for this uh we

389
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,760
don't need that much information and

390
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,720
thomas is going to break down but

391
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,399
essentially

392
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,639
vex is about a product it's linking a

393
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,399
product

394
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,720
a vulnerability and then the status

395
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,880
that's all it is right it's pretty

396
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,800
straightforward um now if we're gonna

397
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
sort of break it down into fields well i

398
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,480
need some metadata

399
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,079
i need some way of specifying the

400
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,199
product

401
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,360
and then i need some information about

402
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,440
that vulnerability uh

403
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,000
is that complicated to do in the json no

404
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,040
it's fairly easy as this is a technical

405
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,279
talk you have to see some code up here

406
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,519
so bear with me

407
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,600
so basically what do we have here we

408
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,560
have some um information about the bex

409
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,920
format so it's a csev profile and a csaf

410
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,680
version

411
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,760
then we have the author in the role

412
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,199
that's the example

413
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,440
company product search um it's a vendor

414
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,199
so you could also have

415
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,959
the coordinator

416
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,000
of that issuing something or a user even

417
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,079
telling you hey i have looked into that

418
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,720
so it's a community approach i've looked

419
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,320
into that

420
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,199
you don't have to worry about it so then

421
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,279
each box has

422
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,320
an identifier so that when we talk about

423
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,279
that bags from example company we can

424
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,399
actually say it's the bags with that

425
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,639
specific identifier and then we have

426
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,920
some

427
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,160
old timestamp information so that we

428
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,040
know what has changed um during the

429
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,519
within the revision history and

430
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,759
what's the current version and when was

431
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,560
it original released

432
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,519
so

433
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,440
now it comes to the fun part and that's

434
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,320
the product tree so product three might

435
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,399
seem a little bit difficult when you see

436
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,480
the first time but it's actually pretty

437
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,759
easy

438
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,720
a product three specifies every product

439
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,399
that is used later on in the document

440
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,880
and that's really to help with matching

441
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,480
since then you only have to take the

442
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,199
product tree object match on that on

443
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,920
your asset database or on your sbom

444
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,399
database and then whatever you get back

445
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,199
you can link it back to the advisory

446
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,199
you will have a human readable product

447
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,040
identifier

448
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,639
and it's basically

449
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,040
what a human would call that product and

450
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,199
then you have something to reference

451
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,000
that within the

452
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,680
product later on

453
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,480
and you basically build up a structure

454
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,480
um in that case we're having a vendor

455
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,360
saying that's my product abc

456
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,560
and that is product version 4.2 and

457
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,480
having that structure it makes it easy

458
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,279
for you to match that against an s bomb

459
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,919
or an asset database

460
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,520
so let's get to the fun part which is

461
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,799
the product status yes so as alan has

462
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,000
said

463
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,880
we have two basic statuses here

464
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,359
they're not affected if you say hey i'm

465
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,280
not affected you should probably tell

466
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,359
the people why you think you're not

467
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,760
affected so that's what we call an

468
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,720
impact statement and if you are affected

469
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,200
then you should tell about the action

470
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,320
the people have to do to actually verify

471
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,440
um or patch or whatever they have to do

472
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,919
and that's the action statement so if

473
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,280
it's fixed you're good nothing to do um

474
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,440
so no further information required and

475
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,000
if it's under investigation

476
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,559
then we expect you to provide an update

477
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,240
later on some

478
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,120
when

479
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,080
when your

480
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,919
investigation is finished to actually

481
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,760
say whether it's affected or not

482
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,280
affected

483
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,960
but other than that you don't need to

484
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,120
have any more information in it

485
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,440
now if we talk about vulnerabilities we

486
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,400
need

487
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,320
some vulnerability identifier and this

488
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,039
can be a cve which we

489
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,320
support and and also encouraged to use

490
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,400
but if there isn't a cve yet assigned

491
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,640
you can also have another identifier in

492
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,200
there um you should describe what the

493
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,360
vulnerability is about and that can

494
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,880
really be the

495
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,320
simple plain cve description um and

496
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,240
actually that's the fun part here

497
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,880
telling about what the product status is

498
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
in that case it's not affected so we

499
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,440
have an impact statement and it says

500
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,919
yeah the class with the vulnerable code

501
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,000
was removed before shipping so you're

502
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,600
good

503
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,720
if we want to link that to an s-bomb and

504
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,160
of course we want to link it to an s-bot

505
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,080
there is something called a product

506
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,760
identification helper

507
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,880
and that really helps you to link that

508
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,440
and do the matching to your s-bom

509
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,320
database in your asset database whatever

510
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,960
you have connected to that what if i'm

511
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,400
good enough with s-bombs that i actually

512
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,240
want to know what the vulnerable part of

513
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,200
the s-bomb might be so that's also

514
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,360
possible you can link it to an s-bomb

515
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,039
component

516
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,679
there are two main formats for s-bomb

517
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,120
cyclone dx and spd-x cyclone dx calls

518
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,679
that link a bomb link

519
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,080
spdx doesn't have a funny name for that

520
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,080
so it's just a specification how you um

521
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,160
create that link and those links are

522
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,720
actually valid examples from the

523
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,840
sbom example so you can see which ones

524
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,280
are referenced there

525
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,400
so

526
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,120
what do we do with the justification

527
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,799
well so this is where we're trying to

528
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,240
sort of really enhance the machine

529
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,440
readability

530
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,520
um right it's one thing to say i'm not

531
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,559
affected but especially in the short run

532
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,480
or for new suppliers people are going to

533
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,559
want a little more information than that

534
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,280
and again having having text and a data

535
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,200
field is always nice right a tool can

536
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,960
extract it and present it but we want to

537
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,440
try to help minimize the number of

538
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,559
people that actually need to pay

539
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,480
attention to something and so we've

540
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,240
developed machine readable status

541
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,960
justifications this is pretty fresh

542
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,200
we're going to have uh the documentation

543
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,080
on the cisa website uh sisa.gov slash

544
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,200
sbam

545
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,919
hopefully by early next week

546
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,919
but essentially there are five machine

547
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,520
readable categories and this isn't meant

548
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,280
to be complete to cover everything but

549
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,799
it's to really help an organization

550
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,799
understand why something isn't affected

551
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,799
so the first one is just very simple hey

552
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,400
there's a vulnerability in a component

553
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,880
but guess what that component isn't in

554
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,200
my software right you're worried about

555
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,559
log for j my products in c go away right

556
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,159
that's gonna be a very helpful thing

557
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,320
that we know for a fact a whole bunch of

558
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,240
people wished that they had had at

559
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,559
machine scale last december when many of

560
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,200
our holidays were ruined uh cisa was

561
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,440
asked to provide a list of all software

562
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,440
that was affected and all software that

563
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,880
was not affected

564
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,559
those of you who are good at set math

565
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,760
will know that that was actually a

566
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,320
pretty tall order to do so having this

567
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,760
would be very helpful

568
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,760
and then you can say you know what

569
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,080
yes i'm using that component

570
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,880
but

571
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,679
guess what the relevant code isn't in my

572
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,200
project right so if the bits aren't

573
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,520
there bad guy can't do anything thomas

574
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,000
used the example of heartbleed right

575
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,679
depending on how you measure it

576
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,159
opens cell version old.old had between

577
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,760
600 and a thousand different function

578
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,039
calls you could make

579
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,640
two of them called the heartbeat

580
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,559
function that allowed an attacker to

581
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,480
read randomly from the web server memory

582
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
so if you were only using you know a

583
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
random other function the prng

584
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,360
then

585
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,280
if your compiler actually stripped out

586
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,720
that code you want to be able to tell

587
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,919
your customer because it's simply

588
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,640
impossible for someone to exploit that

589
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,159
then we get to some of the more nuanced

590
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,480
ideas where the vulnerable code cannot

591
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,960
be controlled by the adversary or it's

592
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,120
not in the execute path so one of them

593
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,640
is just to say hey you know what this

594
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,720
code is over here and the adversary

595
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,520
simply doesn't have any input that it

596
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,360
can make at that portion of my execute

597
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,880
path this is something that is often

598
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,960
used in existing binary analysis tools

599
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,520
static analysis tools and similarly not

600
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,159
in the execute path uh right there the

601
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,240
the function calls to get that simply

602
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,200
are impossible right it requires uh an

603
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,320
error that's driven by a hardware model

604
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,559
uh a hardware error and and that's

605
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,559
something the adversary can't control

606
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,840
and then lastly we have the idea that

607
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,360
yeah i'm using the function and yeah the

608
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,440
bad guy could do it um but inline

609
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,960
mitigation is exist elsewhere right i'm

610
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,919
using something that allows a knob sled

611
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,760
uh but the um but i sanitize my input

612
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,440
somewhere else so we don't need to worry

613
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,480
about it now what's great about these is

614
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,559
an organization can choose

615
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,919
which ones it wants to trust

616
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,000
automatically and which one it wants to

617
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,600
trust uh from a uh with actually having

618
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,200
a human in the loop and this is going to

619
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,440
come also from a supplier

620
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,960
i've been told by for example a couple

621
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,480
of hospitals they're medical device

622
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,760
manufacturers that we're simply never

623
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,960
going to trust

624
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,919
because

625
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,200
they've told us that they're not

626
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,880
affected in the past and they were

627
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,880
affected it and it was not even

628
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,039
patchable right so you know we had to

629
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,280
actually do so that's okay right there

630
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,960
can be risk-averse organizations that

631
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,840
say

632
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,280
we're simply going to demand a patch for

633
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,360
everything what we're trying to do is

634
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,679
create an environment an ecosystem where

635
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,320
we can enable this kind of trust

636
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
so i think we've solved this problem

637
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,280
totally

638
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,640
yep we got it

639
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,720
um so what we have is we have the vendor

640
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,440
vulnerability management at one side and

641
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,000
we have our transport mechanism so the

642
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,080
security advisory and then we have the

643
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,240
customer vulnerability management

644
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,720
and if you look into that with vex

645
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,360
basically we use the same format which

646
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,200
we use for security advisories that are

647
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,600
machine readable so the csaf format

648
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,480
distribution and retrieval mechanism and

649
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,640
then it comes to tools that can assist

650
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,320
and the standard specifies tools for

651
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,760
that um so basically an awesome system

652
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,000
for csaf documents that's a csef content

653
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,640
management system and then on the

654
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,960
customer side you have a csaf asset

655
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,840
matching system um that gives you only

656
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,480
those csaf documents that are relevant

657
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,240
for your environment

658
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,640
and then obviously as a vendor you want

659
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,919
to have

660
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,559
a csef s-bom matching system as an

661
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,960
intake so that your suppliers when they

662
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,440
supply you with csaf documents you can

663
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,840
filter them based on your s-bombs and

664
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,000
the products and the

665
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
libraries that you have in your product

666
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,440
so it's scalable

667
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,200
and pretty easy

668
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,400
so

669
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,320
we are starting to implement this today

670
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,279
uh

671
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,360
some of you are aware that the medical

672
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,279
device community has actually been uh

673
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,360
globally has been one of the leaders in

674
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,840
thinking about software supply chain

675
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,600
transparency uh and so they have already

676
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,039
been working on generating vex documents

677
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,960
for blinking boxes that keep people

678
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,279
alive uh there are a couple of folks in

679
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,840
the ics space who are getting paid right

680
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,279
it's one thing to say hey it's an open

681
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,799
source project and there's some people

682
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,880
writing code but people are actually

683
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,279
paying to produce vexes today in the

684
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,840
industrial control system space why

685
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,159
because patching in the ics space is

686
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,799
very complicated uh often involves you

687
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,400
know taking things offline that people

688
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,919
really don't like to take things offline

689
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,720
so anything you can do to help people

690
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,120
understand what's really at risk is

691
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
going to be beneficial and actually

692
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,279
create real dollars and cents

693
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,600
and of course the government is stepping

694
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,679
in uh some of you i'm not going to

695
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,080
belabor the recent uh us government

696
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,440
executive order that came from the white

697
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,279
house one of the things it did was it

698
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,760
called for software bill of materials uh

699
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,000
the us government formally defined what

700
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,760
is what a minimum software bill of

701
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,320
materials is and then one of the pieces

702
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,559
in that original document that came out

703
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,840
last july

704
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,720
was

705
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,039
this clear specification for future work

706
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,720
not part of the minimum elements but

707
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,320
something that was on the us government

708
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,960
roadmap was to explicitly address

709
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,039
uh vulnerability exploitability it

710
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,200
called out the idea of x and guess what

711
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,360
it recommended vex implementation in let

712
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,760
me guess csun csf

713
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,720
so

714
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
what are some of the next steps here so

715
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,919
basically the automation and retrieval

716
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,960
mechanisms we can use them from csaf um

717
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,440
so security advisories today heavily

718
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,799
rely on a pull mechanism so you as the

719
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,840
customer go you to your vendor and

720
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,600
retrieve those um security advisories um

721
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,520
but it might be an idea that you

722
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,080
actually want to push out those things

723
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,559
that all of your customers got those

724
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,679
things um so that you actually

725
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,919
take the burden off of your hotlines

726
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,640
so that's a question um probably

727
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,640
whether we allow

728
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,880
push mechanisms there um there's

729
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,200
something how do we do aggregation of

730
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,400
that csef has a mechanism for that

731
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,520
and it's still the question about trust

732
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,799
do we trust

733
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,440
whom do we trust and and how do we

734
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,520
ensure that trust along the

735
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,200
distribution mechanism

736
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,120
we also want to make sure that we're not

737
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,000
requiring new people to get new tools

738
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,279
so

739
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,200
organizations already have vulnerability

740
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,720
management processes vulnerable

741
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,400
management tools they pay money to

742
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,640
vulnerable management vendors uh some of

743
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
you have seen the the very convenient

744
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,320
tenable sign across the river as you're

745
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,080
walking here right what we want to try

746
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,919
to do is help people say let's integrate

747
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,720
this into existing tools s-bomb turns on

748
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,880
your warning dashboard lights vex helps

749
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,720
you turn them off uh and as tom

750
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,120
mentioned as thomas mentioned uh right

751
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,720
we need to sort of think about how do we

752
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,799
start to integrate trust judgments and

753
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,640
ultimately have this as policy

754
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,679
enforcement

755
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,600
we also want to make sure that this data

756
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,279
connects to the broader vulnerability

757
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,440
ecosystem this is one of the hardest

758
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,720
parts of all security is the plummet

759
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,320
right it's the making sure that we can

760
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,919
match things together

761
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,520
thomas already talked about how you know

762
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,799
what we can do today is we can link to

763
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,720
s-bombs we can look at desk bomb

764
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,559
components but all of those require

765
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,480
pretty stable and scalable software

766
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,840
identifiers

767
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,440
you know what we're not that good at

768
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,000
today unique product identifiers unique

769
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,240
product identifiers hell even non-unique

770
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,000
product identifiers would be a better

771
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,440
word today

772
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,520
um so there's some hard work that we

773
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,840
have to do yeah so um

774
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,080
it shouldn't be too hard to

775
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,640
convince companies to use bags once you

776
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,520
understand what it really brings you and

777
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,760
how much money that can save you

778
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,880
um but we need to facilitate the shift

779
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,240
in culture

780
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,520
really from the

781
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,240
vulnerability compliance so i patch

782
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
everything that is out there and and

783
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,399
might potentially affect me at some

784
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,480
point to actually

785
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,520
attach those things that matter

786
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,480
um

787
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,600
we need more tools to assist with

788
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,039
generation of x probably also build that

789
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,559
into our

790
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,360
existing tool sets and especially with

791
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,559
the consumption

792
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,640
and ellen will solve the problem of

793
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,399
unique product identifiers so don't

794
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,399
worry about it so stay tuned for some

795
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,760
fun things uh from sisa coming over the

796
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,600
next year or so including a chance to

797
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,440
weigh in on why existing solutions are

798
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,279
terrible and we want to hear from you

799
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,000
about how your single great idea will be

800
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,600
able to solve this problem of unique

801
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,360
identifiers

802
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,080
so

803
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,440
we want to sum up so that we have some

804
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,279
time for questions or to dodge some

805
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,279
thrown fruit uh

806
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,520
basically we've got the idea that number

807
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,760
of vulnerabilities discovered is rising

808
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,840
through a variety of reasons uh we

809
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,320
welcome more security researchers uh we

810
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,240
have better tools to find them there's

811
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,840
greater attention being paid to open

812
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,320
source components in our supply chain

813
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,840
and of course

814
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,440
that jackass who keeps talking about s

815
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,720
bomb is going to make the problem worse

816
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,840
in the short run

817
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,520
not the problem worse he's going to

818
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,000
highlight the things that we need to fix

819
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,760
and of course the idea that we keep

820
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,840
coming back to which is not all

821
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,919
vulnerabilities actually put people at

822
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,120
risk

823
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,919
so what should we be doing so first of

824
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,159
all you should ask your vendors to

825
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,640
provide vex documents as it really makes

826
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,080
your life easier

827
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,640
and then you should start with clean up

828
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,559
your asset inventory so

829
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,399
machine readable

830
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,360
machine

831
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,760
security advisories and wax documents

832
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,600
require you if you want to match

833
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,080
something to have actually something to

834
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,480
match at and that's the asset inventory

835
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,799
or your sbom the earthbomb is already

836
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,960
machine readable so make sure your asset

837
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,159
inventories as well and whatever you do

838
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,240
um even if you don't like the talk today

839
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,559
which i can't imagine but um spread the

840
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,440
word so we put some hashtags in vex

841
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,640
ocsav and and s-bomb um don't google

842
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,520
csaf use ocsaf and don't google why

843
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,279
so yeah that's it so more information if

844
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,960
you want to know about the broader vex

845
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,399
community sisa.gov s bomb we have an

846
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,960
open international working group uh it's

847
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,120
cross sector we've got folks from ics

848
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,880
from big it vendors from small i.t

849
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,960
vendors a couple of random consultants

850
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,480
that just seem to delight in throwing

851
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,679
bombs it's a great community uh we meet

852
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,760
uh at 10 a.m eastern u.s time uh which

853
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
is very early for california and

854
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,640
cocktail hour for europe and once again

855
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,320
we're just not very nice to our friends

856
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,679
in japan we're sorry um so you can find

857
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,159
out all the information about csaf at

858
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,080
csaf.io you can join the technical

859
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,840
committee you can read the latest drafts

860
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,120
for comments what's the current status

861
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,760
on csaf drafts so we passed

862
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,279
last night the

863
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,200
community specifications there too

864
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,799
that's fantastic that's great news i

865
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,000
think that's where the roundup was

866
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,760
and that's basically

867
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,399
the next step so that's stable and you

868
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,120
have the next step the oasis standard

869
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,120
which is basically only 60 days of

870
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,360
public review and then we got a stamp on

871
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,200
it that's fantastic

872
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,480
and of course

873
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,000
if you want to know more about the

874
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,880
broader s-bum world please reach out

875
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,240
we're very interested in working with

876
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,679
you with your organization we're happy

877
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,320
to give a briefing to your pcert team uh

878
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,720
so that you can get on board uh with

879
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,240
essentially the future of transparency

880
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,320
and how to manage risk so that i think

881
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,200
we have a few minutes for questions

882
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:24,569
[Applause]

883
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,960
ah

884
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,559
bj oh and over here and art

885
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,000
getting heckled by our own rdc

886
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,799
yeah i i just want to mention we are in

887
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,960
our

888
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,200
advisories we're trying to support csaf

889
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,720
we've been working on it

890
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,080
we're working on basically getting

891
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,399
advisors inside and producing csaf this

892
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,399
few lessons learned i think the biggest

893
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,360
concern

894
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,480
we still had that you mentioned already

895
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,720
thomas the the transition from today

896
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,840
where we are

897
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,200
and try to get csabs out for

898
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,559
current products

899
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,039
the product tree is quite unrealistic

900
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,519
for some people to build you know so

901
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,120
many of the vendors

902
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,600
have a hard time even filling the cve

903
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,440
product needed affected

904
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,240
so

905
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,760
that's that's one area that has been

906
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,000
challenged that has uh honestly say

907
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,760
apart from that it's a great idea we are

908
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,480
fully supportive of it we use it

909
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,600
and our apis now provide access to csf

910
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,080
documents thanks we have to put kind of

911
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,399
unknown things in there because of the

912
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,399
product tree challenge that's that's all

913
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,840
i mentioned

914
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,919
okay you want to respond quickly to that

915
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,559
so yeah we we know that the product tree

916
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,080
is a challenge um we also know that it's

917
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,720
necessary to tackle the challenge um if

918
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,799
you want to proceed with machine

919
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,440
readability and though we talked about

920
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,440
the challenge of software identity

921
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,919
that's one of the challenges of cve is

922
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,919
while it is more flexible to allow data

923
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,399
input it has the similar complement that

924
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,640
is much harder to parse it uh on the

925
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,360
consumption side

926
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,600
sorry hopefully very uh very specific

927
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,599
question and i probably should know the

928
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,440
answer but i um

929
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,719
could you describe the difference

930
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,440
between the status fixed

931
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,480
and

932
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,480
affected

933
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,960
uh back so not not the not the reasons

934
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,760
for not affected but um

935
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,280
i didn't i didn't i couldn't understand

936
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,599
fixed versus affected

937
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,079
action thank you yeah so if it's already

938
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,480
fixed the vulnerability isn't there

939
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,520
anymore um if it's affected

940
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,599
um you still have to do something to

941
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,679
reach the status fixed

942
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,560
um

943
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,918
and if it's not affected the

944
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,879
vulnerability wasn't there

945
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,440
so the goal is to help someone realize

946
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,280
just sort of the status so it's

947
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,079
important to not conflate the i was

948
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,719
never affected and an earlier version

949
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,960
was affected and this version is not

950
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,720
yeah i think i have some questions about

951
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,720
the time dynamic but i'll

952
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,079
bring those up in our discussions thank

953
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:02,800
you

954
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,640
fantastic thank you

955
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,760
greg

956
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,760
art maybe have a second question now so

957
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,760
may i have two

958
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,320
um i'm thinking of these questions

959
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,000
from a vendor perspective

960
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,520
is the intention that the vendor's going

961
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,800
to have to be constantly uh pushing data

962
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,320
out through a future api to as i go from

963
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,160
affected to fixed is the intention the

964
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,520
vendor needs to keep jiggling that and

965
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,480
so

966
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,040
basically if

967
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,440
it's not putting out vex documents for

968
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,200
every cve

969
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,000
which are obviously not affected um

970
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,520
if you have a version that was affected

971
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,560
and you provide a patch and now

972
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,800
that new version that patched version is

973
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,640
fixed you should inform your customer

974
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,200
about that so i would expect you to to

975
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
update that information

976
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,400
and then is the intention of the

977
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,880
under investigation so

978
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,960
at that time p-search generally aren't

979
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,119
going to have an advisory ready because

980
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,240
they might have just

981
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,960
had this disclosed so the intention is

982
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,560
they push out that information through

983
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,240
vex it's under investigation and then at

984
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,720
some subsequent date they provide a more

985
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,560
richer explanation

986
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,680
exactly it's a way of letting your

987
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,280
customers know that your p cert's on the

988
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,520
case

989
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,960
thank you all and again please get in

990
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,560
touch if you have further questions or

991
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,870
comments

992
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:33,779
