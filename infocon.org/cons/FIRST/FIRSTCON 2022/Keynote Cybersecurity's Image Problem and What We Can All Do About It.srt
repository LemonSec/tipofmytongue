keynote presentation uh for the

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,080
conference uh

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,240
it it has been quite challenging to get

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,519
this set i have been you know my my name

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,440
is shuri fashion i'm

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,680
the chairman of the new board of

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,239
directors of first

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,239
it's my second year on the board has

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,040
been quite dynamic

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,600
process organizing and

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,680
setting up the floor for this conference

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,680
to happen

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,640
so without further ado i'd like to

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,239
introduce

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,520
our

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,680
diamond sponsor aws and we have america

24
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,160
taboran i i hope that i got your name

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,720
close to right

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,320
from aws security

27
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,760
aws is the world's most comprehensive

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,799
and broadly adopted cloud platform

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,360
millions of customers trust aws to power

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,799
their infrastructure and applications

31
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,880
organizations of every type and size are

32
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,520
using aws to lower costs

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,600
become more agile and innovate faster

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,079
aws provides on-demand delivery of

35
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,159
technology services via the internet

36
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,640
with pay-as-you-go pricing

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,479
you can use these services to build and

38
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,799
run virtually any type of application

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,720
without upfront costs or ongoing

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,000
commitments

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,720
you only pay for what you use

42
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,200
aws gives you more services and more

43
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,439
features within those services than any

44
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,360
other cloud provider

45
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,000
this makes it faster easier and more

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,840
cost effective to move your existing

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,079
applications to the cloud

48
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,839
and to build anything you can imagine

49
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,200
hey everyone

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,199
my name is emrick i work for abs

51
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,080
security operations here in uh in dublin

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,319
so first thanks everyone for coming to

53
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,400
my city it's not actually my original

54
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,920
city but i've made it home and i really

55
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,760
like it there

56
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,840
i'm gonna talk to you today about my

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,319
love and hate relationship with acronyms

58
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,000
and con names as to

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,120
so as to introduce dr baines here

60
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,680
i'll start with a figure 7 3441.

61
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,720
when you join amazon they say

62
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,920
one of the first things they say is like

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,360
don't worry about it everything is in a

64
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,440
wiki you don't have to remember anything

65
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,920
and they point you to wiki page with uh

66
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,560
it's it's name the acronyms wiki page

67
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,120
and there is 7

68
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,879
341 entries so you know easy peasy right

69
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,800
we also love our code names i mean who

70
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,640
doesn't in this industry raise your hand

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,000
if you've

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,239
created or contributed to software names

73
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,760
named after a star wars character

74
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,360
lord of the rings

75
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,080
yeah we have these and we have of course

76
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,200
countless variations of dragons cats

77
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,720
ponies they are pretty popular these

78
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,400
days as well and i guess there's no

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,640
downside in most cases

80
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,959
to using fun acronyms i mean you know

81
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,959
it's part of the fun at work

82
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,120
but for me for my day-to-day job it

83
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,879
actually makes life harder

84
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,440
so i work for aws security operations

85
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,280
and one of the things we do

86
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,360
you can you can take a parallel to in

87
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,920
the networking to the default route

88
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,280
if anybody at amazon or even partners or

89
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,840
customers has a concern whether it's

90
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,319
perceive the real security concern about

91
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,560
an abs services

92
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,519
they come to my team right so

93
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,920
what we do what my team does is

94
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
obviously there's a lot of triage

95
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,080
we we validate if there is a security

96
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,959
issue

97
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,439
we try to find where it applies is you

98
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,640
said than done

99
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,840
um and then we find out who to engage

100
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,680
well best of luck you know knowing who

101
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,040
to engage when

102
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,200
when your your software or team is

103
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,040
hiding behind a code name

104
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,480
so i'm going to share a few personal

105
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,480
anecdotes and these are real

106
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,920
it's from my experience working at

107
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,560
amazon my first week of on-call on that

108
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,079
team i was a security engineer seven

109
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,000
years ago or six years ago

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,040
and

111
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,360
i made a couple of mistakes uh one of

112
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,240
them is i didn't know my muppets i'm not

113
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,600
american born and raised so i didn't

114
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,040
know my muppets and apparently i learned

115
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,720
that muppets are actually british things

116
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,880
so you know i'm still not good at it and

117
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,440
i engaged the cookie monster team well

118
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,360
actually i had to engage the elmo team

119
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,600
so it turns out these are two different

120
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,280
two different teams but they actually

121
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
report to the same manager at least on

122
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,520
amazon i'm still not sure about the show

123
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,160
another thing we do is uh we have a very

124
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,040
large presence we have a presence global

125
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,360
and we use airport code to refer to

126
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,360
location and

127
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,600
one of my first executive report there

128
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,440
was an issue happening in beijing

129
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,639
capital of china airport code bjs

130
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,919
and i really wanted to be part of the

131
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,600
team i was like one weekend i wanted to

132
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,320
be like doing the same as the rest and i

133
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,919
referred to it

134
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,479
using the only the first two letters of

135
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,720
the airport code i'll let you think it

136
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,400
through but i definitely made an

137
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,240
impression there

138
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,639
as uh as years passed and i grew up in

139
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,000
rank noticed the military jargon

140
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,440
i i started to realize there was a very

141
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,759
hidden effect of using this

142
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,240
common terminology common jargon it

143
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,320
really helps create a sense of team a

144
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,759
sense of belonging

145
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,560
and i really love working at amazon

146
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,639
working at abs i work with very smart

147
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,520
people i'm really lucky

148
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,919
but one of the things we do is to create

149
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,320
a sense of team a sense of empowerment

150
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,639
is we tell people every role

151
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,880
every standard operating procedure is

152
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,000
always

153
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,880
unless you know a better way

154
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,479
that's very important

155
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,319
so i hire smart people i'll tell them

156
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,919
essentially

157
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,199
follow the rules unless you know a

158
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,440
better way

159
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,680
others say it's also equally important

160
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,400
to uh to have a authority when you're

161
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,479
security well i'm very lucky in the

162
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,280
cloud aws security is job zero we can

163
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,199
take like security can take precedence

164
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,360
on any business goal and i think this is

165
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,479
quite unique

166
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,800
and i'm feeling like very empowered by

167
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,680
that

168
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,759
another thing that helps is actually

169
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,440
creating a sense of team

170
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,400
and a common thing that people refer to

171
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,880
is like doing team events team building

172
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,800
and true story again personal anecdote

173
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,639
three weeks ago my senior manager was

174
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,199
very upset because another team got a

175
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,639
super awesome budget uh to go skiing in

176
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,720
the austrian alps as a team building

177
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,319
event and he was like

178
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,880
really mad at that um we didn't get the

179
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,560
budget you know we but i did remind him

180
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
i think don said yesterday never never

181
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,759
let a good

182
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,160
cyber security incident go to waste i

183
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,560
did remind that last winter our whole

184
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,680
team was

185
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,520
together in a team building exercise in

186
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,000
december only there wasn't much snow it

187
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,120
was called look for shell

188
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,680
the point being and the point i'm making

189
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,039
is uh

190
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,880
we didn't have to ask

191
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,759
everybody and again true story everybody

192
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,039
showed up

193
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,440
so i know that we got something right i

194
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,639
know that we

195
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,319
we've succeeded in building something

196
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,880
bigger than us than ourselves we have

197
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,440
this sense of collective duty we got it

198
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,759
right but as i approached the talk of

199
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,039
today of dr baines i was thinking

200
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,360
what if there was a dark side to this

201
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,360
imagery this jargon

202
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,720
what if there was

203
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,160
a better way

204
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,800
what if it was intimidating

205
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,560
i think we should find out ladies and

206
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,680
gentlemen

207
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,879
dr victoria baines

208
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,039
thank you emmerich for that

209
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,599
fantastic introduction actually if i

210
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,919
think i've got a fan which is which is a

211
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,599
good thing and i hope that i will

212
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,560
convert some of you as well today so my

213
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,400
name is victoria baines and i like to

214
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,039
play dangerous games

215
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,919
and this morning's dangerous game is

216
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,319
wearing red lipstick under a face mask

217
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,400
so i would like you please to do me a

218
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,240
favor perhaps mr gibson if you could

219
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,840
lead this activity that would be very

220
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,120
helpful

221
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,000
um could you tell me whether or not i

222
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,080
look like pennywise from it

223
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,640
because i worked i thought to myself oh

224
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,080
i could just have a look at the screen

225
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,599
but here's what happens when i have a

226
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,000
look at the screen

227
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,480
so unless do i

228
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,920
it's all right thank you you would say

229
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,160
that anyway so you're the wrong person

230
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,600
to ask

231
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,040
thank you very much for helping me with

232
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,519
that um i am professor of i.t at gresham

233
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,399
college and this is a recent appointment

234
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,320
um gresham college is in the city of

235
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,800
london and it is the oldest higher

236
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,120
education institution in the city of

237
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,839
london it was founded in 1590

238
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,480
and previous professors so one of the

239
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,240
professors of geometry was sir isaac

240
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,680
newton

241
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,000
so there is no pressure on this new job

242
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,640
that i have

243
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,120
gresham college is important to me and

244
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,240
to

245
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,600
my agenda if you like because

246
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,800
it was founded precisely to provide a

247
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,640
free public education to people in the

248
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,279
city of london and as the colleges

249
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,000
embrace technology they now live stream

250
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,279
public lectures around the world and on

251
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,959
youtube

252
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,680
and so my remit for the next three years

253
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,240
is to produce 18

254
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,440
free

255
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,640
public

256
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,519
live streamed lectures demystifying

257
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,440
technology for people

258
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,720
and you'll be pleased to know this is

259
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,839
something oh thank

260
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,279
you honestly i wasn't fishing for

261
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,040
compliments it's just to set up the rest

262
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,240
of the talk

263
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,320
but that's very kind

264
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,920
um and

265
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,240
one of the things that is really really

266
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,079
close to my heart is how we engage with

267
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,519
members of the public who aren't us

268
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,839
on cyber security so my lecture series

269
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,519
for this coming year starting in

270
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,240
september gresham.act.uk

271
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,079
quickplug

272
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,120
is cyber security for humans how can we

273
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,000
humanize cyberspace

274
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,480
so i would like you to come with me on a

275
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,399
very brief journey where we have to

276
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,920
pretend we have to do a bit of

277
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,360
make-believe

278
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,399
and our pretending is that we aren't

279
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,399
information security specialists

280
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,279
and

281
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,120
i'm not suggesting that you have to

282
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,519
pretend that you're your grandmother or

283
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,440
your aged aunt who doesn't understand

284
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,000
technology at all but just think you all

285
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,440
have friends

286
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,360
who don't work in information security

287
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,600
you all have contemporaries you go out

288
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,440
for a beer or you go out for a coffee

289
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,040
with them

290
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,880
they also

291
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,279
want to know about technology and about

292
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,440
cyber security in terms that they can

293
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,040
understand

294
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,200
and most importantly

295
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,360
they want you to communicate with them

296
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,920
in a way that empowers them

297
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,200
to do something about it concrete steps

298
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,040
that can protect them

299
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,800
their families and friends their

300
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,120
businesses so that's the mindset for

301
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,640
this particular session

302
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,959
now

303
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,600
i don't have

304
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,680
an academic background in computer

305
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,720
science

306
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,240
and i am one of those people and one of

307
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,920
those irritating people who goes on

308
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
podcasts and does interviews and things

309
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,079
like that goes to diversity events and

310
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,560
says you don't have to have a computer

311
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,000
science degree to work in information

312
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,519
security

313
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,399
i have a professional background in

314
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,560
investigating and analyzing cyber crime

315
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,639
so if you've looked at my bio you'll see

316
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,639
that i worked for the serious organized

317
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,440
crime agency in the uk the predecessor

318
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,279
of the national crime agency i then

319
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,680
worked for europol the european cyber

320
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,760
crime center where i was responsible for

321
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,959
the eu's cyber threat analysis and i did

322
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,200
a few kind of global publications

323
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,839
looking at the scale and nature of

324
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,160
online crime

325
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,240
in that role i was part of the machinery

326
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,880
and you know full confessional

327
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,560
i was part of the machinery that

328
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,120
represented

329
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,800
cyber threats

330
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,600
to

331
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,040
ministers

332
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,399
to people who paid my wages

333
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,360
to companies but also to citizens out

334
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,079
there because we did sanitized versions

335
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,000
of all of our threat assessments and i

336
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,480
have to confess that at the time i

337
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,720
didn't necessarily think

338
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,760
very long and hard about the potential

339
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,120
impact of those communications on people

340
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,959
that weren't ministers are pay masters

341
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,120
large corporations involved in cyber

342
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,440
security for instance

343
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,240
because my prime motivation was to make

344
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,240
sure that people understood the

345
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,160
importance the scale of the threat

346
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,000
i then went to work for

347
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,200
facebook as was meta now

348
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,279
where i was very much on the receiving

349
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,480
end of communications about security and

350
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,079
safety

351
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,959
and i kept getting these echoes from my

352
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,360
education

353
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,519
echoes that made me think that things

354
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,240
might not have changed very much in a

355
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,440
very long time about how we communicate

356
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,360
to people on security and safety issues

357
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,000
particularly when it comes to technology

358
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,079
cyber security online safety

359
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,760
my education and my doctorate are in

360
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,920
ancient rhetoric

361
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,160
and for those of you who are fans of

362
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,320
greek and roman culture

363
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,519
i wrote an entire phd thesis on the

364
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,720
satires of juvenile a second century

365
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,199
roman poet not juvenile although

366
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,560
sometimes he is

367
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,480
um juvenile

368
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,279
and what juvenile was a master at was

369
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,680
threat inflation

370
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,639
so he very famously in his third satire

371
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,240
depicts just ordinary life at rome going

372
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,920
out for dinner

373
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,639
going to meet your boss

374
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,680
navigating the street traffic he depicts

375
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,720
that as troy on the night of its

376
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,079
destruction

377
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,399
so rest assured information security

378
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,560
specialists you were not the first

379
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,760
people to co-opt trojans as a means of

380
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,800
describing a threat

381
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,199
so i kept hearing these echoes

382
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,240
and i thought this is really bugging me

383
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,959
because i think

384
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,920
that the emperor augustus in the first

385
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,680
century a.d when he talked about

386
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,639
making rome secure again

387
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,839
i think

388
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,800
he's a bit like donald trump

389
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,279
or rather donald trump's a bit like

390
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,199
augustus and i'm not suggesting for a

391
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,399
second that trump studied roman history

392
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,839
at any point

393
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,600
in his life

394
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,440
and even if he did study it he probably

395
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,519
didn't pay any heed to it but history

396
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,279
repeats itself as we know

397
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,160
so what did i do with these echoes well

398
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,120
like you i had more time on my hands in

399
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,040
2020.

400
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,360
now i tell a lie i didn't have more time

401
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,600
in my hands i just wasn't traveling as

402
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,800
much

403
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,279
we were all pretty busy

404
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,040
the one thing about information and

405
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,759
cyber security is that you know that the

406
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,079
fact that people are working from home

407
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,079
changes the nature of your work it

408
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,480
doesn't make that work go away

409
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,279
so what did i do in lockdown the various

410
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,079
lockdowns in the uk in 2020

411
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,399
well i did a number of things firstly i

412
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,519
watched far too many reruns of old cop

413
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,160
shows on the television

414
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,519
um special uh favorites well certainly

415
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,279
if you're into your intelligence dramas

416
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,600
and you know uk culture there's a series

417
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,160
called the professionals with two very

418
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,959
hot actors from the late 70s in it i

419
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,600
quite enjoyed that i quite enjoyed all

420
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,519
of the the uk cop dramas like the

421
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,160
sweeney but also i really enjoyed

422
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,639
watching chips again

423
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,720
chips is a common theme because i also

424
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,880
at far too many potato chips

425
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,680
and

426
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,160
like many of you i had a bit of a swing

427
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,920
back from that got to a certain point

428
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,199
and thought right i need to do some

429
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,000
exercise so if you saw me hobbling onto

430
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,560
the stage just then that's what happens

431
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,720
when you've eaten too many potato chips

432
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,640
and you've decided that the way to deal

433
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,480
with this is to go on a crash course of

434
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,280
high intensity interval training

435
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,400
it's just

436
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,039
it's pain in your body in places that

437
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,400
you didn't know you had

438
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,880
but i also had the opportunity to write

439
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,640
the book that i had been meaning to

440
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,679
write for a very very long time based on

441
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,400
all of those echoes that i'd heard in

442
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,440
the last 20 years really since i

443
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,480
completed my doctorate

444
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,160
and what i found

445
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,000
surprised me

446
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,039
i had a hunch a hypothesis if you like

447
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,039
that i wanted to test

448
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,120
that things really hadn't changed very

449
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,080
much in the last 2000 years

450
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,720
that we particularly politicians and

451
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,120
public figures are still talking about

452
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,320
security issues in exactly the same way

453
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,679
or in a very similar way to how we did 2

454
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,280
000 years ago

455
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,840
and spoiler alert what i found was that

456
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,640
actually that probably is the case

457
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,799
i went all the way back

458
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,520
to the start of rhetoric

459
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,080
with aristotle and his definition that

460
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,200
rhetoric

461
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,840
is the means and the art or the

462
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,799
technology the greek word techner which

463
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,919
curiously in greek is both art and

464
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,000
technology which is kind of cool we

465
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
treat those separately now don't we but

466
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,160
the art and the means of persuading

467
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,320
people

468
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,640
so i want you to keep that with you the

469
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,960
idea that every time we communicate

470
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,360
about cyber security with any

471
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,280
stakeholder group

472
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,320
we are seeking to persuade them

473
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,559
of a particular

474
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,520
framing of that issue a particular

475
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,919
framing of that threat it doesn't make

476
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,120
us dishonest it just means we come to it

477
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,720
with an objective

478
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,039
of getting that other person to agree

479
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:06,320
with us about how we see that problem

480
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,600
i analyzed um gosh i analyzed the u.s

481
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,840
national security strategy and for those

482
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,840
of you who are familiar with u.s

483
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,840
security you'll know that the u.s

484
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,240
national security strategy is a long

485
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,400
policy document but at the front of each

486
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,000
one

487
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,400
there is a preface

488
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,600
apparently written by the u.s president

489
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,080
and i would argue in his own voice so

490
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,000
even though he has a team of staffers to

491
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,280
write this thing

492
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,760
and by doing a really close reading by

493
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,320
analyzing these texts in exactly the

494
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,440
same way as i analyzed my roman poets

495
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,080
and my threat inflation from 2000 years

496
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,400
ago i was able to identify that

497
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,160
authentic voice

498
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,080
you'll be unsurprised to hear that

499
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,320
trump's preface is like a word salad

500
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,120
it's amazing he just kind of fires

501
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,080
images at you um out of seemingly out of

502
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,000
a cannon and they kind of land in the

503
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,159
right place

504
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,200
the right words the right terminology

505
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,000
but a personal security cult

506
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,840
that is very very similar to that

507
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,960
generated by roman emperors

508
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,120
that's by the by i then did another

509
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,600
chapter on online safety rhetoric and

510
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,799
particularly how in certain countries

511
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,039
there's a dynamic relationship between

512
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,840
the tabloid media and government policy

513
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,360
makers

514
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,159
such that the

515
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:33,679
sensationalization of online personal

516
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,200
safety issues

517
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,440
kind of contaminates

518
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,000
the public discourse contaminates how

519
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,640
regulations are developed

520
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,360
i was just in time to do a chapter on

521
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,360
pandemic rhetoric

522
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,679
that rhetoric of freedom

523
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,760
sacrifice the slavery of wearing masks

524
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,480
some really interesting stuff came out

525
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,440
of the pandemic as also of course with

526
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,480
the covid 5g conspiracies and even the

527
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,120
merging of covid 5g vaccine conspiracies

528
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,919
it wasn't a great time really to be on

529
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,640
bill gates's security detail the last

530
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,440
couple of years

531
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,559
and

532
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,559
you'll be relieved to hear i did a

533
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,200
chapter on cyber security and for that

534
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,240
specifically i analyzed three different

535
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,080
groups of communications again

536
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,080
subjecting them to a really close

537
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,760
reading like they were

538
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,320
literary artifacts of how we want to

539
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,080
communicate on cyber security issues

540
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,919
so i looked at government communications

541
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,559
particularly law enforcement and yes i

542
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,159
did read my own threat assessments back

543
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,520
to see whether i too had engaged in

544
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,360
threat inflation

545
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
and i'm relieved to say i was really

546
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,919
relieved to find um that there was one

547
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,400
occasion where i had used the phrase

548
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,480
cyber arms race

549
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,400
but i got away with it because i put it

550
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,440
in quotation marks

551
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,039
so i looked at those government

552
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,520
communications i looked at vendor

553
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,840
communications and you'll see that as we

554
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,440
go through some of the examples i do

555
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,960
sanitize those because i don't want to

556
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,039
get sued

557
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,720
and i also looked at criminal

558
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,159
communications

559
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,880
so sextortion emails

560
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,559
phishing emails

561
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,880
ransomware pop-up screens

562
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,400
and what i found

563
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,480
really surprised me

564
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,840
i found that all three of these groups

565
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,120
used very very similar techniques to

566
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,600
communicate with end users

567
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,200
about cyber security

568
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,039
and two of those are summarized here so

569
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,440
firstly amplification

570
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,679
which in rhetorical terms aristotle

571
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,840
would tell you cicero would tell you is

572
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,520
hyperbole or the latin word

573
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,559
amplification where it's where it comes

574
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,320
from

575
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,480
exaggerating the threat and i don't mean

576
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,880
outright lying about it

577
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,840
but perhaps using statistics in creative

578
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,120
ways

579
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,600
perhaps talking about the fact that the

580
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,919
threat is getting graver and graver

581
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,559
every day without having the statistics

582
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,640
to back that up perhaps

583
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,200
and i have certainly done this and i'm

584
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,440
sure some of you have so you know don't

585
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,760
feel too hard on yourself

586
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,919
talking about cybercrime is growing

587
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,720
exponentially

588
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,520
what does that actually mean

589
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,360
have you got the data to back that up or

590
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,120
is it just a gut feeling or is it

591
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,480
something that we keep telling each

592
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,600
other that cybercrime's growing

593
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,679
exponentially because we all need more

594
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,520
resources to fight it right

595
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,679
okay amplification

596
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,679
but also that sense of urgency

597
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,760
and we do that in several ways we talk

598
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,919
about cyber crime and evolving cyber

599
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,840
threats as being novel there's a new

600
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,159
threat coming out zero days when we talk

601
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,919
about zero days they're in the wild oh

602
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,360
my god they're here now we need to do

603
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,960
something right now

604
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,559
we need to do something immediately

605
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,919
but also

606
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,159
the idea that if you don't click that

607
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,039
link

608
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,760
if you don't buy that thing

609
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,159
something catastrophic will happen very

610
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,960
very soon

611
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,240
so if you're a security policy wonk like

612
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,039
i have been for a government or for an

613
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,640
international organization you say we

614
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,000
absolutely need to do something about

615
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,240
this now because if we don't we're all

616
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,919
going to hell in a handcart it's going

617
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,320
to be catastrophic give us more money

618
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,640
please

619
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,799
completely understandable completely

620
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,559
legitimate in that context

621
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,200
but amplifying and making that threat

622
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,320
more urgent for your end users

623
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,200
might not empower them if you don't give

624
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,880
them the information that they need to

625
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,120
protect themselves and to protect their

626
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,159
assets

627
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,760
so we need to have a bit of a closer

628
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,840
look at that

629
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,840
what else do we do well if we're

630
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,440
thinking about click on the thing now

631
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,200
and we'll have a couple of examples of

632
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,279
this

633
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,000
cyber security vendors will say

634
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,559
you're under threat by this thing

635
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,320
not you're under threat he's here's a

636
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,200
really good package you're not always

637
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
here's a really good package of

638
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,159
awareness and information that will help

639
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,440
you to protect yourself but by the thing

640
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,360
by the thing and then you don't have to

641
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,039
think about this ever again just by the

642
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,320
thing

643
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,840
and if you think about

644
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,559
a criminal approach a criminal email a

645
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,799
ransomware pop-up screen

646
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,640
pay as bitcoin

647
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,760
and then you won't have to worry about

648
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,799
this other ever again if you don't

649
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,720
everybody is going to see you having a

650
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,720
really really nice time on youtube

651
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,039
click the thing pay the thing

652
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,960
don't empower yourself you're powerless

653
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,000
so then i can't leave you there can i i

654
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,240
have to think about well if it's so

655
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,000
victoria baines if you're so clever and

656
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,320
you're able to point the finger at us

657
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,919
what are the better ways of doing it

658
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,960
what are the alternatives so i did look

659
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,279
at the alternatives maybe

660
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,039
scaring the hell out of people and

661
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,720
panicking them

662
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,440
isn't the way to make people safer and

663
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,000
more secure or might not be the most

664
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,320
effective way and certainly might not be

665
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,400
the only way

666
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,640
so i looked at some alternatives and

667
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,559
we'll see some of those in a couple of

668
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,960
seconds

669
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,480
so then i needed to find out

670
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,640
what do people actually get when they

671
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,200
look for something like cybercrime

672
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,080
prevention online

673
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,000
and full disclosure i did this search a

674
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,440
couple of years ago because it's what

675
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,679
the book text was based on so i don't

676
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,400
know if this replicates exactly on the

677
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,520
first of july 2022

678
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,200
but i googled cybercrime prevention

679
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,799
and i thought well i'm just as

680
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,440
interested in visual rhetoric

681
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,520
the imagery as i am the language

682
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,039
and this is what we came up with as the

683
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,120
first screen of search results

684
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,360
so what are we seeing here

685
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,520
there's something of a common theme

686
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,320
isn't there there are common attributes

687
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,679
we've got

688
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:22,559
oh

689
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,360
barriers whether it's police tape

690
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,840
or whether it's padlocks

691
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,080
chaining up your screen chaining up your

692
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,399
keyboard is apparently a valid cyber

693
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,399
crime prevention technique presumably

694
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,320
because it means you can't engage in

695
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,799
anything online

696
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,640
there's a lot of blue light isn't there

697
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,720
oh blue light

698
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,960
everybody knows it's a historical fact

699
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,440
proven with evidence that all cyber

700
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,159
analysts work in blue light don't we

701
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,159
um and that's why so many of us have to

702
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,039
wear spectacles

703
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,480
there's lots of cascading binary so

704
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,080
that's what cyber crime prevention is

705
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,039
all about you have to understand code

706
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,480
otherwise this is not for you don't

707
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,320
forget the police tape and the padlocks

708
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,720
if this is not for you

709
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,480
cybercrime prevention is all about

710
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,559
allowing pirates to jump out of your

711
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,640
laptop screen

712
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,200
and possibly it looks actually a bit

713
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,279
like a head lice headlouse doesn't it

714
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,880
that one down the bottom i thought it

715
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,480
was a spider but it's not it doesn't

716
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,480
have enough legs for a spider

717
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,640
um but there are things coming out of

718
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,360
your screen so absolutely don't

719
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,840
you know taping up your screen is not

720
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,080
going to be sufficient if a pirate's

721
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,640
coming out of it you probably just need

722
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,279
to put your computer somewhere where the

723
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,360
bad guys can't get to you

724
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,120
and you'll notice it is computers it's

725
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,880
laptops it's not

726
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,640
handheld devices

727
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,720
um we have one really important

728
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
exception and i don't know what their

729
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,360
search engine optimization is like but i

730
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,679
do really like

731
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:56,480
the

732
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,279
one second from left on the bottom

733
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,039
that's the government of the philippines

734
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,799
that's the philippines national police

735
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,960
so shout out to anybody from the

736
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,360
philippines this is great these are

737
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,159
actually this answers the question of

738
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,399
cyber crime prevention tips there they

739
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,559
are

740
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,799
um who are the people who engage in

741
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,000
cyber crimes according to this google

742
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,760
image search well

743
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,840
they look like they're guys but they

744
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,080
tend not to have faces which is kind of

745
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,360
weird

746
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,440
they wear a hoodie because as everybody

747
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,360
knows anybody who works in tech wears a

748
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,279
hoodie

749
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,880
and

750
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,799
they're a bit hunched over

751
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,679
there's obviously a few problems with

752
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,440
shoulder and backache maybe a little bit

753
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,840
of sciatica

754
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
so we've got some consistency there

755
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,679
haven't we but mainly

756
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,559
this is not for you unless you're that

757
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,399
person and you really like working in

758
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,719
blue light

759
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,480
that dominant image

760
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,880
of the faceless guy because it does

761
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,840
appear to be a guy according to the um

762
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,080
according to the bill

763
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,440
in the hoodie with cascading binary is

764
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,440
quite a dominant image we see it all the

765
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,320
time

766
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,360
on media

767
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,679
until august 2020 it was also the image

768
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,399
that greeted you on the fbi cybercrime

769
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,720
prevention website

770
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,559
and if there is anybody here from the

771
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,320
fbi don't worry i'm not going to give

772
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,720
you a really rough ride because this is

773
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,279
the dominant way of representing

774
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,880
cybercrime

775
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,480
and fair dues this was changed

776
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,559
during the pandemic

777
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,559
so you know there's there is some it

778
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,960
looks a lot more accessible now this is

779
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,080
a stock

780
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,320
shutterstock image which you will see

781
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,159
replicated all over cyber security news

782
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,120
stories

783
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,399
let's break this down a little bit

784
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,080
who is this guy because he does appear

785
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,360
to be a guy from his hands

786
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,120
well he is faceless

787
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,360
so he's an unknown threat you can't

788
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,720
possibly know him he's anonymous

789
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,559
um he seems to be a bit of a magician

790
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,519
he's magicking up these numbers in front

791
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,760
of your very eyes to the backdrop of

792
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,720
cascading binary we've got rapacious

793
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,880
hands haven't we we've got something

794
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,039
going on with the full nosferatu here

795
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,880
in fact if we wanted to be a little bit

796
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,720
controversial and provocative couldn't

797
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,399
we say something like

798
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,679
well he's a faceless digital global

799
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,880
rapist isn't he

800
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,039
and i use those words advisedly because

801
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,840
he's there he's snatching over the

802
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,159
world so what ordinary people think of

803
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,159
do we reckon and i to be fair i haven't

804
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,080
done any market research i haven't sat

805
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,760
down i'm not a social scientist i

806
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,919
haven't sat down and interviewed loads

807
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,240
of folks about this i'm looking at the

808
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,440
potential persuasive effect

809
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,399
again we work in this industry we're a

810
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,120
little bit perhaps desensitized to this

811
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,880
kind of imagery because we see it all

812
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,200
the time

813
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,679
what about if we're not working in this

814
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,440
industry if we're not information

815
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,279
security specialists

816
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,960
i would hazard

817
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,159
that possibly what some people see and

818
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,440
particularly

819
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,320
older members of the population

820
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,360
when they see this

821
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,600
they see this

822
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,080
another faceless chap

823
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,720
who looks a bit violent and aggressive

824
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,760
and

825
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,000
what do we know about the grim reaper

826
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,240
well

827
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,360
we know

828
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,200
that with a couple of exceptions in

829
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,760
traditional english folk songs which i'm

830
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,039
very very happy to sing for you later

831
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,000
we know that there is nothing that you

832
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,760
can do to escape his clutches

833
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,120
if he's coming for you it's your time

834
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,039
you are are you not absolutely powerless

835
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,679
you are absolutely helpless

836
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,039
when this guy shows up

837
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,720
so when this guy shows up

838
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,640
i would wager

839
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,200
that a lot of people will go

840
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,240
he's pretty scary faced with him i can't

841
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,799
possibly do anything to protect myself

842
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,159
my family my business so why bother

843
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,799
why bother

844
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,440
now

845
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,399
there is some text under this image and

846
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,679
i'm going to take you through it

847
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,919
thinking about some of that visual

848
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,240
imagery and we're going to play exactly

849
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,519
the same game we're going to play the

850
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,039
google image game and this is what i did

851
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,960
and thinking in particular about the

852
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,440
metaphors the metaphors are the things

853
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,519
the visual images

854
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,760
that make us engage with something like

855
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,159
it's more immediate something that feels

856
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,000
remote like offenses involving data

857
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,080
and networks

858
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,800
has to be translated in a way that we

859
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,918
feel that we can identify with it right

860
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,159
and the way we do that time and again in

861
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,239
communications about cyber security and

862
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,719
cyber threats is we do it through these

863
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,159
metaphors these words that conjure up

864
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,199
images

865
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,359
in your minds

866
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,320
and trigger emotions based on those

867
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,239
images

868
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,079
okay and please forgive me because i'm

869
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,399
going to read from a click script

870
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,320
because i don't want to get sued by the

871
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,280
fbi right

872
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,440
okay

873
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,719
they say

874
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,599
the collective impact of computer and

875
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,918
network intrusions

876
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,918
is staggering

877
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,879
that's staggering

878
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,599
billions of dollars are lost every year

879
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,480
repairing systems hit by such attacks

880
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,880
yeah right that's probably true

881
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,079
ransomware is insidious

882
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,640
and the inability to access important

883
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,280
data can be catastrophic

884
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,839
in terms of the loss of sensitive or

885
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,720
proprietary information the disruption

886
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,839
to regular operations financial losses

887
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,320
incurred to restore systems and files

888
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
and the potential harm to an

889
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,599
organization's reputation now

890
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,240
this depends very much on your

891
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,040
particular preferred flavor of

892
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,960
catastrophe whether that is man-made

893
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,320
or whether it's a natural disaster

894
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,240
so the fbi continues

895
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,119
the loss of access to person and often

896
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,920
irreplaceable items including family

897
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,960
photos videos and other records can be

898
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,880
devastating

899
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,320
for individuals as well

900
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,800
now when we say something is a

901
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,839
catastrophe or devastating in this way

902
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,400
we use them metaphorically because these

903
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,359
words

904
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,040
literally refer to large scale physical

905
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,720
destruction

906
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,480
so for those latin and greek fans out

907
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,760
there and i know there are many of you

908
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,520
catastrophe literally means to

909
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,160
physically throw something upside down

910
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,520
to bowl it over and devasto that

911
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,160
devastate comes from means to raise it

912
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,200
to the ground to completely obliterate

913
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,680
it so when we're representing the loss

914
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,640
of personal data and family photos do we

915
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,720
think it's proportionate

916
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,359
to say that it's the same as being

917
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,520
physically obliterated

918
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,440
it's upsetting it's disruptive it might

919
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,040
not be catastrophic and devastating

920
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,880
in the same way when the manager of a

921
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,520
football team or sorry a soccer team for

922
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,400
non-uk folks says in a post-match

923
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,960
interview that yeah yeah me and the boys

924
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,760
we were devastated by the result it

925
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,520
doesn't really mean that he was

926
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,400
physically obliterated by it it's a

927
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,480
metaphorical usage

928
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,960
but what we certainly have is still that

929
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,480
residual

930
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,280
that vestige in our guts when somebody

931
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,240
says

932
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,160
oh it was catastrophic it was

933
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,240
devastating

934
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,160
it's arguably

935
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,079
triggering

936
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,960
to use popular terminology at the moment

937
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,160
it makes it more immediate it's

938
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,560
something we can relate to but

939
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,599
crucially it also exaggerates and it

940
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,480
amplifies

941
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,119
in the process now

942
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,280
one of the fbi's stated priorities and

943
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,760
again this is no disrespect to the fbi i

944
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,240
did exactly the same in law enforcement

945
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,480
when i was writing threat assessments

946
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,720
and they have a stated priority on its

947
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,359
public-facing website which they call

948
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,320
the going dark problem

949
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,720
which for them is the inability to

950
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,839
intercept

951
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,119
private encrypted communications and as

952
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,800
we know darkness is also another way in

953
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,320
which government agencies criminals and

954
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,000
vendors all use the same tactics to

955
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,160
depict cyber threats so

956
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,280
let's do

957
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,800
our visual google images game again the

958
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,680
same visual analysis but for a tv ad

959
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,920
from a couple of years ago for a

960
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,760
consumer anti-virus vendor and again i'm

961
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,440
not going to name this company because i

962
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,480
really don't want to get sued

963
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,800
so you've got to imagine a male voice

964
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,119
a bit like the kind of the the voice

965
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,079
over on a thriller

966
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,200
today's digital world

967
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,799
has a dark side

968
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,680
because this is what people think about

969
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,160
when you say darkseid and you don't work

970
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,480
in infosec

971
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,440
it's lord vader

972
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,160
we need we need to kind of acknowledge

973
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,440
that fact

974
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,680
sorry i did this wrong actually today's

975
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,960
internet has a dark side that's better

976
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,599
isn't it i should make more effort

977
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,560
because everyday things like shopping

978
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,599
banking and even browsing online

979
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,760
can can

980
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,560
expose personal information and make

981
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,760
people vulnerable to cyber criminals

982
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,079
lord vader is coming for you because

983
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,280
you're shopping online

984
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,680
more than 850 million people in 16

985
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,520
countries were victims of cyber crime in

986
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,000
the last year alone mobile ransomware

987
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,240
attacks went up by 33

988
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,800
86 of adults may have put their

989
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,200
information at risk may have put that

990
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,640
information at risk using public wi-fi

991
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,440
crikey and there's a victim of identity

992
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,280
theft every two seconds

993
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,520
with 50 million customers around the

994
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,240
globe we are the consumer allies for

995
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,200
today's connected world meeting the

996
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,160
dangers of cyber crime

997
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,160
the dangers of cybercrime with the power

998
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,400
of cyber safety and let me tell you i

999
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,240
was so tempted to put up a slide of the

1000
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,040
power rangers

1001
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,200
but then they said they were on a

1002
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,319
mission

1003
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,440
to secure the digital world just when it

1004
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,560
needs saving the most

1005
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,800
product x because as you know i don't

1006
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,440
want to get sued

1007
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,160
protectors of the digital universe

1008
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,280
a real tv advertisement from a couple of

1009
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,400
years ago for consumer

1010
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,960
antivirus

1011
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,640
how do we feel

1012
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,880
as listeners and viewers

1013
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,720
pretend you've watched that advert with

1014
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,400
partic particularly with these images

1015
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,160
because i think they work really well

1016
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,040
um how do we feel listening to that

1017
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,640
audio

1018
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,280
do we feel like we know exactly what we

1019
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,200
need to do to protect ourselves and our

1020
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,480
families or is our only option to buy a

1021
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,960
thing and be otherwise powerless

1022
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,760
it seems to me

1023
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,240
that we have

1024
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,920
intergalactic overlords coming for us

1025
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,680
every time we surf the web

1026
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,160
number salad

1027
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,680
the numbers are too big for us to

1028
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,079
comprehend they're presented too quickly

1029
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,920
for us to really get to grips with

1030
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,640
there's a lot of maze and cans

1031
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,680
rather than actual incidences of

1032
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,399
compromise

1033
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,119
you need to be the kind of person who as

1034
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,880
we know tom cruise really does his own

1035
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,720
stunts who is quite happy to be

1036
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,119
suspended from a wire to access an

1037
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,520
information system

1038
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,520
and effectively you need to be this

1039
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,440
group of incredible

1040
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,319
beings in order to protect anybody let

1041
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,720
alone yourself from cyber threats

1042
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,040
there's a lot here

1043
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,960
and i would say that even though this is

1044
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,520
a couple of years old we're still seeing

1045
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,520
it and we're still seeing particularly

1046
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,040
the macho

1047
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,760
military side that's attached to all of

1048
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,680
this love of science fiction which is

1049
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,920
completely legitimate but just because

1050
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,160
you work in cyber and just because you

1051
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,000
like science fiction

1052
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,800
doesn't make you an intergalactic cyber

1053
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,200
warrior

1054
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,599
it does sometimes all right i'll give

1055
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,200
you like five minutes a week when you

1056
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,280
can be the intergalactic cyber warrior

1057
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,760
and it does with certain audiences but i

1058
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,920
just don't think this plays out very

1059
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,640
well with ordinary people ordinary

1060
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,000
people at home

1061
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,760
who aren't just ordinary people are they

1062
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,760
they're extraordinary they want to know

1063
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,920
what to do to protect themselves they

1064
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,680
own businesses

1065
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,079
we talk all the time about how we can't

1066
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,720
reach small and medium-sized enterprises

1067
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,480
these are the people you are trying to

1068
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,599
get to

1069
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,560
when you communicate in this way

1070
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,880
i am a particular fan because i like my

1071
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,720
animals and i do

1072
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,240
emmerich and i were having a chat about

1073
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,400
the muppets earlier i am a huge muppets

1074
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,440
fan um so in any group like this i'm

1075
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,640
always rooting for the animal

1076
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,160
and i'm

1077
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,480
not particularly interested in people

1078
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,839
um and rocket raccoon

1079
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,520
great name but he could be the name of a

1080
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,040
cyber threat couldn't he in current

1081
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,599
parlance

1082
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,119
rocket raccoon

1083
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,240
fancy bear bashful panda is one that i

1084
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,400
would like to see adopted but my

1085
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
favorite and you can have it for free is

1086
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,000
demonic sloth

1087
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,560
i think that's that's one i would really

1088
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,880
really like to see in a cyber threat

1089
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,839
report in the next few months please and

1090
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,560
thank you

1091
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,880
it's a fly point but it does i think

1092
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,720
illustrate as much as you know emmerich

1093
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,560
was talking about acronyms i have a

1094
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,560
whole section on acronyms that you'll be

1095
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,920
relieved to hear i'm not going to take

1096
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,040
you through

1097
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,599
um but when we dress up apts as

1098
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,920
fantastic animals

1099
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,319
we are making this so much more remote

1100
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,319
for people that aren't already part of

1101
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,560
our in-crowd

1102
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,880
we're playing to ourselves

1103
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,440
we're not playing to people who aren't

1104
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,359
already information security specialists

1105
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,280
and there's one threat report from the

1106
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,800
last few years and again i'm not going

1107
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,040
to name it

1108
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,400
that describes their staff as seasoned

1109
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,599
cyber warriors doing hand-to-hand combat

1110
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,319
with malware

1111
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,960
what on earth does that mean it gives an

1112
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,599
entirely false impression doesn't it of

1113
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,240
who works in information security and

1114
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,000
this is no disrespect to the people who

1115
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,760
are military veterans who are law

1116
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,400
enforcement veterans you are a very

1117
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,760
important contingent of the information

1118
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,680
security workforce

1119
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,119
but you shouldn't be the only contingent

1120
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,280
everybody should be able to work in

1121
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,000
information and cyber security and if

1122
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,480
you don't recognize yourself as an

1123
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,640
astronaut if you don't recognize

1124
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,040
yourself as a science fiction character

1125
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,119
if you don't recognize yourself as

1126
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,040
someone who is comfortable wearing

1127
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:25,359
kevlar you also are entitled to work in

1128
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,480
cyber security

1129
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,440
so here's what i think all of that

1130
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,119
imagery that i've presented to you what

1131
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,920
i think it does

1132
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:37,920
i think it makes

1133
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,160
our potential clients our citizens the

1134
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,240
people we're trying to protect i think

1135
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,480
it makes them feel

1136
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,640
very very small and powerless but i

1137
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,520
think it risks two other very important

1138
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,800
points

1139
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,599
at least in relation to the information

1140
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,520
security workforce and the cyber

1141
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,280
security industry

1142
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,680
because by saying that we are

1143
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,480
superheroes that are always going to

1144
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,079
rescue catastrophic situations all of

1145
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,160
the time we are putting unrealistic

1146
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,599
expectations

1147
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,720
on ourselves on all of us

1148
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,720
and we know two things

1149
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,280
we know we have a burnout and human

1150
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,440
resilience problem in information

1151
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,880
security

1152
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,079
so why would we keep generating these

1153
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,200
unrealistic expectations of the people

1154
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,319
who work in infosec

1155
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:31,520
equally

1156
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,200
we know we have a recruitment problem

1157
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,000
we know we can't get the skills

1158
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,960
and yes we still insist on three to five

1159
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,760
years experience for entry-level roles i

1160
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,839
have dream of cert for people who can't

1161
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,359
possibly have got them that's a

1162
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:51,040
different discussion but equally

1163
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,760
if a young person or an older person

1164
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,680
transitioning careers wants to work in

1165
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,000
cyber security

1166
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,040
and they don't see themselves in that

1167
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,240
kevlar wearing intergalactic cyber

1168
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,920
warrior mode

1169
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,400
we are failing on recruitment and we are

1170
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,359
failing on retention we need in the

1171
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,079
interests of diversity and inclusion but

1172
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,560
also just to survive

1173
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,520
as information security as a discipline

1174
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,559
to broaden this out to think about

1175
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,960
the images that we are conjuring when we

1176
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,960
communicate in this way

1177
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,880
this is something that's very close to

1178
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,960
my heart because

1179
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,359
i'm a member of the worshipful company

1180
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,680
of information technologists in the city

1181
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,680
of london it's it's the it guild

1182
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,079
and i chair the security panel there and

1183
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,960
one of the things that it's my job to do

1184
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,720
is to make sure

1185
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:53,040
we have as diverse talent as possible in

1186
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,920
cyber security in the uk

1187
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,599
not just because it's the right thing to

1188
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,359
do but because from a business

1189
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,680
perspective that's how we're going to

1190
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,359
survive by not recruiting in that image

1191
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:07,839
all the time

1192
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,079
so how can we do this differently i did

1193
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,280
promise you alternatives

1194
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,520
and no i'm not on commission from disney

1195
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,599
but i do think there are worse things we

1196
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:18,559
can do

1197
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,839
than look at wreck-it ralph ralph breaks

1198
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,520
the internet

1199
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,599
so hands up if you have seen this movie

1200
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:28,880
do you know i thought there might be

1201
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,640
quite a few of us in this particular

1202
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,480
audience

1203
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,839
that's great

1204
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:36,240
it's okay to watch kids movies and i say

1205
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,880
that as a die hard muppet fan

1206
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,079
um

1207
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,599
ralph breaks the internet for those of

1208
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,880
you who haven't seen it

1209
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,960
ralph and his friend

1210
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,040
vanellope von schweitz

1211
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,280
and they go into the internet and the

1212
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,359
internet is represented as a physical

1213
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,200
place it's fantastic

1214
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,000
so they're driving around and there are

1215
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,960
you know ebay hoardings paypal hoardings

1216
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,359
facebook hoardings so imagine

1217
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:04,720
blade runner

1218
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,559
with all of the you know the lit

1219
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,880
billboards and things flying past but

1220
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,960
it's the internet it's a physical place

1221
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,680
that they've entered

1222
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:14,960
now

1223
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,240
ralph gets dumped by vanellope because

1224
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,559
vanellope is absolutely obsessed with

1225
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,640
this driving game which is beautifully

1226
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,520
named

1227
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,160
slaughter race

1228
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,160
and vanellope is so obsessed with

1229
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,640
slaughter race that ralph just can't get

1230
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,839
her attention at all so he is approached

1231
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:37,200
by a gentleman called jb spammly on the

1232
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,480
right hand side there he's an

1233
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,200
advertising merchant who says no it's

1234
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,000
cool

1235
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
i can introduce you to this guy down in

1236
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,200
the dark web so they go down

1237
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,280
physically in an elevator to the dark

1238
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,160
web

1239
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,640
so again fans of greco-roman myth

1240
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,559
there's all sorts of overtones of

1241
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,640
odysseus going down to the underworld

1242
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,800
here there's a lovely comparative

1243
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,280
article to be written by a research

1244
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,880
student on that

1245
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,920
um they go down to the dark web and they

1246
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,319
meet this dark web retailer who's called

1247
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,400
double dan and he's called double down

1248
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,920
because of that little brother that he's

1249
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,440
got growing out of his neck but you

1250
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,880
shouldn't mention it because he's very

1251
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,599
very sensitive about it

1252
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,520
double down as you can see

1253
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,319
it's like a humanoid

1254
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:25,359
slug combo a little bit reminiscent of

1255
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,440
jabba the hutt

1256
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,400
he's voiced by someone who's doing a

1257
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,720
passable impression of russell brand or

1258
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,960
ricky gervais so it's that whole

1259
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,960
traditional

1260
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,440
and slightly inferior infuriating

1261
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,760
assimilation of um

1262
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,880
you know brits to criminal masterminds

1263
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,040
which i suppose we live with

1264
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,000
um

1265
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,920
and and keeps british actors in business

1266
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,599
doesn't it and gives them oscar-winning

1267
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,480
performances every so often he goes to

1268
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,440
the dark web retailer double down to buy

1269
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,319
an insecurity virus

1270
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,640
that will slow down slaughter race so

1271
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,160
that vanellope will get bored

1272
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,559
and having slowed it down she'll want to

1273
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,040
leave the internet the insecurity virus

1274
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,800
is called arthur

1275
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,599
and you can see him here

1276
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,760
that is arthur it's a comedy shopkeeper

1277
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,480
routine which again we have also had for

1278
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,160
thousands of years it goes all the way

1279
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,680
back to roman and athenian comedy

1280
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,000
it's a comedy shopkeeper routine that

1281
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,839
we've seen perhaps most famously in

1282
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,480
popular culture in monty python's dead

1283
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,079
parrot sketch

1284
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,480
it's the comedy pet shop routine

1285
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,799
and double dan says

1286
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,160
it's not dangerous

1287
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,760
and ralph says are you sure it's not

1288
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,040
dangerous are you sure everything's

1289
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,480
going to be okay

1290
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,640
and double dan says

1291
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,359
only if you're not stupid you're not

1292
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,520
going to be stupid with it are you

1293
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,200
dramatic irony you can see how the whole

1294
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,079
thing is going to be set up

1295
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:03,520
now

1296
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,440
we're making this more accessible for

1297
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,680
people who aren't specialists and yes

1298
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,800
since ostensibly it's for children

1299
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,960
but clearly this is one way of

1300
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,040
representing what can go wrong on the

1301
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,000
internet because it does go wrong

1302
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,440
there's a bit of a spoiler isn't there

1303
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,800
in the title ralph breaks the internet

1304
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,200
and it's not that it's not scary when

1305
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,359
arthur comes out of that toolbox

1306
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:32,319
it makes kids jump it made me jump i'm

1307
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:33,440
the kind of person who can't watch

1308
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,440
horror movies and then go to sleep so

1309
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,240
that's that's just me

1310
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,160
so we're not saying

1311
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,400
that cyber threats aren't serious or

1312
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,880
scary we're just making them a little

1313
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,040
bit more accessible for people and

1314
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,520
showing them the consequences in a way

1315
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,200
that they can understand and that they

1316
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,319
can relate to without necessarily

1317
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,640
scaring the hell out of them so that's

1318
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,280
one means of doing it

1319
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,599
here's what i think we shouldn't do

1320
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,200
and i've been very very careful to

1321
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,040
sanitize this in such a way that

1322
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,839
hopefully again i won't get sued

1323
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,599
this is something that appeared

1324
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,359
last year

1325
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,680
and it is a cyber security vendor's

1326
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,079
website

1327
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,760
we have all

1328
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,359
lived through

1329
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,440
a global public health emergency and

1330
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,680
it's not over yet

1331
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,160
but we've seen a certain amount of

1332
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,920
ambulance chasing with regard to

1333
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,200
likening

1334
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,160
the pandemic the real pandemic

1335
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,640
to cyber threats

1336
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,160
so let's have a look at this prepare for

1337
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,880
a cyber pandemic secure your everything

1338
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,559
now push the button now if you don't

1339
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,559
push the button now you're going to die

1340
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,839
of a computer virus

1341
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,079
people and organizations have suffered

1342
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,480
greatly from the coronavirus pandemic so

1343
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,440
it is really consciously exploiting

1344
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,280
covid

1345
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,200
many critical lessons are being learned

1346
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,160
but none more important

1347
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,800
than that another devastating crisis

1348
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,160
could be brewing

1349
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,040
wow

1350
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,200
you're already hugely sensitized and

1351
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,680
fearing for your own life and those of

1352
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,599
your loved ones

1353
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,119
but you need to panic even more now

1354
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,800
because something else something worse

1355
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,760
is coming a catastrophic remember that

1356
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,559
word

1357
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,680
cyber event has long been envisaged and

1358
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,720
with today's digitally connected world a

1359
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:32,160
global cyber pandemic is now a reality

1360
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:33,680
is it

1361
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,760
is it really no i don't think it is

1362
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,520
what you wanted to get across there were

1363
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,160
cyber threats are important

1364
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,160
that was all you were entitled to get

1365
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,200
across

1366
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,640
not that it was as bad or the next bad

1367
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:54,000
thing comparable with deaths from covid

1368
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,079
that said

1369
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,640
and i would say this is hugely tasteless

1370
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,240
and inappropriate

1371
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,880
but that said i do think we can treat

1372
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,160
cybersecurity as a public health issue

1373
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,760
and i'm not the first person to have

1374
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,760
said that so researchers for the last 10

1375
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,240
years have been looking at how we can

1376
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,160
treat cybersecurity as a public health

1377
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,079
issue and again

1378
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,400
i'm not talking about some of the stuff

1379
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,400
that you guys work with national

1380
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,880
security threats protecting critical

1381
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,319
infrastructure

1382
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:26,240
but some of the lower level stuff that

1383
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,480
we actually need

1384
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,359
ordinary people to engage on

1385
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:32,799
this is exactly what we should be

1386
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,400
treating as a public health issue

1387
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,520
because

1388
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,960
we can look

1389
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,400
at cyber crime in terms of preventing

1390
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,119
communicable threats like communicable

1391
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:44,319
diseases

1392
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:47,359
non-communicable threats and we can

1393
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:50,319
address cyber risk behaviors it maps

1394
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:54,880
perfectly to a public health framework

1395
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,200
and one thing we do know about the covid

1396
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,440
pandemic is as much as

1397
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,480
you and i will have been frustrated

1398
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,720
by people who didn't want to wear masks

1399
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,480
who didn't want to keep a distance who

1400
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,480
didn't want to sneeze into a

1401
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,079
handkerchief or

1402
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,960
you know blow or cough into their elbows

1403
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,920
what we saw was that time and again

1404
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,200
there were millions of people who did

1405
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,000
millions of people in the community who

1406
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
were quite happy

1407
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,319
to protect themselves and others by

1408
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:28,559
doing exactly those things

1409
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,799
so as much as we think

1410
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:31,839
that

1411
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:33,760
perhaps at our most

1412
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,839
least charitable

1413
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,160
that people aren't smart enough or they

1414
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,880
don't care enough about cyber security

1415
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,880
to protect themselves and others we have

1416
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,880
this as a precedent

1417
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,839
people can wear masks people can keep a

1418
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,680
social distance

1419
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,960
people can

1420
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,440
get vaccinated

1421
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,920
so i would advocate for a public health

1422
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,920
approach to cyber security but i'd like

1423
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,319
it to be a little bit more like some of

1424
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:02,559
the traditional public health campaigns

1425
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:03,920
that we had

1426
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,799
now

1427
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:07,520
i was a child of the late 20th century

1428
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,200
and we were very much living with the

1429
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,680
legacy of 1940s public health campaigns

1430
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,200
coughs and sneezes spread diseases

1431
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,599
okay so how would that work cyber coughs

1432
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:22,000
and sneezes spread diseases that needs

1433
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,359
more thought

1434
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:26,640
but it can be as simple as that it can

1435
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,359
be

1436
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:29,760
as easily communicated to members of the

1437
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,760
public as that

1438
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,559
so i'm going to leave you with a very

1439
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,200
short video that as much as it was made

1440
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,920
in the 1940s and apologies for the very

1441
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,599
grainy quality

1442
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:42,400
um

1443
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,200
i grew up with and i grew up with the

1444
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,119
slogans and the sentiment around that

1445
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:48,640
and i'd like us all to have a think

1446
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,920
about

1447
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,160
how we might be able

1448
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,480
to apply something like this

1449
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,200
to cyber security oh and before i do i

1450
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,440
meant to give a shout out to tom miller

1451
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,520
from scissor if you attended his talk

1452
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,599
yesterday i thought that was brilliant

1453
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:06,319
because he resurrected that term

1454
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:08,480
cyber hygiene

1455
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,160
cyber hygiene we used to talk about it

1456
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,079
all the time didn't we cyber hygiene

1457
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:13,599
digital hygiene

1458
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:16,079
and then it fell away slightly

1459
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:17,760
but this is exactly what we're talking

1460
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,880
about cyber hygiene it's perfectly

1461
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,839
possible

1462
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,760
you may have met a few people who like

1463
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,680
doing this sort of thing

1464
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,680
they're a nuisance i agree but pretty

1465
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,040
harmless

1466
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,119
you have certainly seen thousands like

1467
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,440
this they're not a nuisance they're a

1468
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,079
real danger

1469
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:43,760
i stop it you

1470
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,440
stop it stop it

1471
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,599
come here what do you think you're up to

1472
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,200
you've probably infected thousands of

1473
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,520
people already what do you think this is

1474
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,759
for

1475
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,559
yes that's all right but here's another

1476
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:02,720
way of using your handkerchief now

1477
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,720
sneeze

1478
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,880
come on

1479
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:11,200
all right never mind

1480
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,119
close your eyes

1481
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,960
it's the low-tech equivalent of pen

1482
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,440
testing

1483
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:33,040
see what i mean

1484
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,920
that's the idea

1485
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:48,400
now you can carry on

1486
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,240
so i'm going to leave you with that i i

1487
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,480
absolutely love it because what does it

1488
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,520
do

1489
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,079
it tells you what the problem is

1490
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,480
and it also tells ordinary people

1491
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,160
exactly what they need to do about it

1492
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,640
now fair deals the guy does give him a

1493
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,839
handkerchief

1494
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:08,559
what the guy doesn't do is say sneeze on

1495
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:09,440
me

1496
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,680
so that you don't have to sneeze on

1497
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,839
anybody

1498
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:15,680
and when we're encouraging people to buy

1499
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,960
things

1500
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,200
we're not empowering them to protect

1501
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,799
themselves and others so it would be

1502
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,640
lovely if we could have a bit more of a

1503
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,720
think about that now

1504
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,640
i'm not saying you will need to change

1505
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,640
what you're doing keep doing what you're

1506
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,359
doing because what you do is amazing you

1507
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,680
are protecting our nations you are

1508
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,760
protecting our societies you are

1509
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,000
protecting all of these people that i

1510
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,640
have referred to in this talk

1511
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,559
but what i would ask is that the next

1512
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:45,119
time you have to communicate directly

1513
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:46,799
with those citizens

1514
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:48,720
you just have a think in the back of

1515
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,079
your mind about am i actually empowering

1516
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:54,480
them to protect themselves or am i just

1517
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,319
scaring the hell out of them because i

1518
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:59,119
would wager that the more you can do

1519
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,760
the former empower them to protect

1520
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,119
themselves

1521
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:05,359
the less of a headache you are going to

1522
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:08,000
have eventually yes you're still going

1523
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,559
to have to fight off the fancy bears and

1524
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:12,480
the bashful pandas and the demonic

1525
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,200
sloths and rocket raccoon

1526
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,359
but the low level stuff

1527
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:20,640
might actually improve if we can have

1528
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,280
more of a public health approach to

1529
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,599
cyber security

1530
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,520
and with that i'm going to thank you

1531
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,599
very much indeed for your time thanks a

1532
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,839
lot

1533
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,400
do we have time for questions yes i was

1534
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,359
going to say

1535
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:41,839
we have time for questions if you'd like

1536
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:42,799
to ask

1537
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,480
here are the mics

1538
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,000
maybe you can take one or two

1539
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,000
hi okay let's see if

1540
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,200
now it's on

1541
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,920
um so you gave many examples of bad

1542
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,760
communication

1543
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,799
what would you

1544
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:03,039
offer as the best examples of good

1545
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:06,000
communication in cyber security

1546
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:06,720
so

1547
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,119
one of the troubles that i have is where

1548
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,839
i want to talk about good examples again

1549
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:14,079
i can't name names because then i'll

1550
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:15,920
look like i'm doing product endorsement

1551
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,839
but one example would be

1552
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:21,440
um from a consumer anti-virus vendor

1553
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,520
we've got a tv ad running in the uk at

1554
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,559
the moment um that stages

1555
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,520
um

1556
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,839
addressing cyber threats as a

1557
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:32,319
therapeutic intervention like a kind of

1558
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:34,880
aa meeting and people come into a room

1559
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,720
and say hey internet we want to talk to

1560
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,039
you about some of your behavior recently

1561
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:41,280
um i shared this image online and look

1562
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,119
what's happened to it and then someone

1563
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:44,799
else says i've just been asked for

1564
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:47,680
bitcoin what is a bitcoin um and it and

1565
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,960
it's a really humorous but important way

1566
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,280
of telling people that okay by buying a

1567
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,839
product they they can get back in

1568
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:57,440
control

1569
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,880
of what they're doing so that would be

1570
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,960
one from the consumer side

1571
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,599
um i think and i can name names in this

1572
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:06,559
regard um but i think scissor in the u.s

1573
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:08,319
to a certain extent also the national

1574
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:11,760
cyber security center the ncsc in the uk

1575
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,559
they do great communications four

1576
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:16,880
different stakeholder groups

1577
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,559
so you know communications for small and

1578
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:21,280
medium-sized enterprises we had a great

1579
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,000
campaign in the uk um that started

1580
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,920
during 2020 looking at covid scams

1581
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,880
and a line was set up a kind of email

1582
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,839
reporting mechanism online form simply

1583
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:35,680
nothing more than that where people

1584
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,559
could report um phishing scams that were

1585
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:41,119
related to covid so you know counterfeit

1586
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,240
stuff counterfeit vaccines etc um

1587
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,520
fraudulent um you know scams related to

1588
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,760
benefits claims

1589
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,480
people reported in their thousands

1590
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,640
so giving people an opportunity to be

1591
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,200
the marshals themselves to get actively

1592
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,400
involved

1593
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,200
in cyber security and countering threats

1594
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,280
is a great way to do it because you're

1595
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,960
taking people with you then rather than

1596
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,079
just

1597
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:07,599
talking at them

1598
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:11,720
so those would be a few i think

1599
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,839
hello thank you for the presentation i

1600
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:18,880
have issue every time when i read

1601
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,280
data theft because for me

1602
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,200
theft means i don't have it anymore

1603
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,160
so with your experience can you comment

1604
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,240
what's going to be future me will we

1605
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,200
think that

1606
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,880
mobile phone theft is still what i have

1607
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,520
mobile phone or bicycle

1608
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,480
so we

1609
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,039
adjust to the data theft concept or we

1610
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:42,559
modified data theft as not theft but

1611
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:45,280
illegal copy or something yeah it's so

1612
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,280
that so the future side of things is a

1613
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,760
whole nother talk that i do on cyber

1614
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,480
security in 2030 because i get involved

1615
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,280
in futures projects around that and what

1616
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,960
i would say when you mention about data

1617
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,240
theft

1618
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,920
you know for years i've been toying

1619
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,039
around this concept of identity theft

1620
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:05,280
identity theft means you haven't still

1621
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,839
got it exactly to your parallel and but

1622
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,839
the one that gets my go every time and

1623
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,520
i'm sure it does

1624
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,720
all of you

1625
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,559
um is when the media refers to a hack

1626
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:18,559
and it's not a hack it's a data breach

1627
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:20,559
because you know somebody left something

1628
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:24,000
on a printer um you know we have this

1629
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,200
time and again and so i do a lot of

1630
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,640
challenge to the media with tv shows and

1631
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,400
radio shows and things like that saying

1632
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,599
well no this isn't a hack

1633
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:38,640
cambridge analytica wasn't a hack

1634
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,559
you know but it was referred to as

1635
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:42,480
facebook hack for a really really long

1636
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,319
time and i should say full disclosure

1637
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,880
i'd left the organization by then and it

1638
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,319
was nothing to do with cambridge

1639
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:51,920
analytica um but i did get called into a

1640
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,160
lot of media around that and the first

1641
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,599
thing i said was do you know what this

1642
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:57,599
isn't a hack we need to stop referring

1643
01:05:57,599 --> 01:05:58,960
to it as a hack

1644
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,640
so the more that you can do whenever

1645
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,559
you're engaging with media organizations

1646
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:03,680
to say

1647
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,520
can we be a bit more accurate about the

1648
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,440
terminology the better

1649
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:13,599
thank you

1650
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,960
okay i think we have run out of time

1651
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,839
sharif yeah we are all we are almost out

1652
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:21,599
of time but

1653
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,280
can you please join me and to thank

1654
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,760
victoria for such an insight thank you

1655
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,920
everyone thanks a lot thank you very

1656
