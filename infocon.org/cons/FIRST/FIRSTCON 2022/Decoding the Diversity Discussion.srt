crowdstrike and will be presenting today

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,000
on decoding the diversity discussion uh

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,840
please save your questions for the end

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,600
of the session there's mike's at the

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,519
middle in the front of the room uh if

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,279

through your app on your phone with that

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,960
please welcome emma

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,559
thank you

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,280
welcome to my talk today on decoding the

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,920
diversity discussion and i'm extra

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,920
grateful that you could make it along

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,239
for two main reasons the first because

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,320
there is a wonderful talk track running

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,239
through the whole week but specifically

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,640
right now at this time so a shout out to

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,480
my fellow crowdstrike consultants who

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,600
are also

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,079
speaking in the room next door but also

26
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,600
especially grateful that you're here

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,080
because it's the last session of the day

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,479
and i am acutely aware that i'm the one

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,200
person that stands between you and what

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,600
promises to be another wonderful evening

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,560
in dublin so no pressure right to make

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,880
sure that we are good to go right on

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,759
time

34
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,799
so on that note i will make a start

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,880
so essentially i look at the diversity

36
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,880
discussion in the same way that i think

37
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,840
i and many of us here used to look at

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,560
research into the cyber threat

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,000
so if we think it's fairly customary

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,400
fairly standard that we will all

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,360
be aware of threat briefs reports even

42
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,320
listen to podcasts on future predictions

43
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,320
on the cyber threat as well as look at

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,159
those specific blogs from incident

45
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,479
responders as they report on what's

46
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,720
happening on the front lines

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,759
now

48
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,079
thinking of that and remembering that

49
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,119
that's so custom for us um is so

50
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,240
important

51
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,960
because actually there's some parallels

52
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,040
between that situation

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,920
and how we reflect on thinking of the

54
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,560
importance of research into the cyber

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,599
threat

56
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,599
and actually i'm sure many of us have

57
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,480
thought

58
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,319
or read or consumed some of this

59
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,720
information and definitely had a moment

60
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,080
where we think

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,480
that's really interesting that's really

62
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,640
insightful but certainly from my

63
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,239
perspective there's been occasions where

64
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,560
i've wondered now what on earth do i do

65
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,040
with that information how do i pull out

66
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,680
those key salient points and take it

67
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,080
back to my everyday role in the incident

68
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,920
response community

69
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,319
and we know it's that reflective process

70
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,560
which has driven us and continues to

71
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,680
drive us

72
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,080
to focus on the importance of actionable

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,640
intelligence or operational intelligence

74
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,040
so consuming information that always

75
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,760
finishes up with something specific to

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,720
take away a measure or an action to make

77
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,360
sure you and i can protect ourselves and

78
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,920
defend against the adversary

79
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,400
now you're probably wondering emma what

80
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,239
on earth has that got to do with the

81
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,239
diversity discussion

82
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,319
well actually bear with me because i

83
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,159
think there's some similarities in both

84
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,000
of these situations

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,920
so let's break it down

86
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,239
diversity as a topic has been around a

87
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,640
really long time much like the value of

88
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,720
research into whatever threat it is that

89
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,159
we face

90
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,560
also recent years we've seen a huge

91
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,120
increase in the amount of narrative

92
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,000
associated with diversity often in the

93
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,640
context of real world events

94
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,799
much like ransomware and the evolution

95
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,560
of the cyber threat that's really got on

96
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,879
the agenda for all of us over the last

97
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,239
couple of years

98
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,239
and finally as incident response

99
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,959
professionals we're much more familiar

100
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,680
with the diversity topic and the value

101
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,159
in which diverse perspectives lead

102
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,720
directly to much better more enhanced

103
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,640
incident response efforts

104
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
and that familiarisation is similar when

105
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,799
we look at intelligence and research

106
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,640
because we know it's so important to

107
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,959
have intelligence-led activity so that

108
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,200
we can respond in the best way possible

109
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,239
so

110
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,799
let's think a little bit then about what

111
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,720
the differences are between those two

112
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,839
scenarios for me the main thing is that

113
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,639
the diversity discussion has not yet got

114
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,199
to the point where we focus on that

115
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,880
actionable item

116
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,199
there's so many amazing strategic

117
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,600
projects initiatives that happen in this

118
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,400
space and we see and read and hear about

119
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,840
all the time

120
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,160
but what's often missing is that nugget

121
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,040
of information that action that we all

122
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,000
need to take as individuals as teams and

123
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,600
of course across our organizations

124
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,240
so i'm here to hopefully take us that

125
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,720
little bit further in the conversation

126
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,280
to pull out some key items that mean

127
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,680
that we can be more intentional about

128
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,840
inclusion because when we decode that

129
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,560
diversity topic what really matters for

130
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,039
you and i is how we include and embrace

131
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,840
everybody that we interact with

132
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,400
but who am i to be here talking to you

133
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,759
about this

134
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,840
so by way of introduction my name is of

135
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,240
course emma jones and i'm a senior

136
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,960
consultant with crowdstrike i work with

137
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,440
organizations across the uk europe

138
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,759
middle east and africa on a whole range

139
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,520
of things associated with incident

140
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,600
response and readiness

141
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,759
but alongside that i'm incredibly

142
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,639
passionate about diversity and inclusion

143
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,720
i've been so fortunate to be involved in

144
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,479
a number of different projects both as a

145
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,800
volunteer and with the organizations

146
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,039
that i've worked with over the last 15

147
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,560
years and had some professional

148
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,320
portfolios alongside the day job

149
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,080
you can see here on the screen a little

150
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,320
bit about who i am what i'm interested

151
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,160
in and what keeps me busy in my spare

152
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,479
time and then some of the organizations

153
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,080
that i've had the pleasure of working

154
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,960
with and volunteering with over recent

155
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,720
times

156
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,560
now before we get into

157
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,759
the detail

158
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,840
i just want to give some context and

159
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,039
make sure that we can frame the

160
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,160
discussion in the best way possible

161
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,479
and essentially it's to remind ourselves

162
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,120
and everybody that we work with that we

163
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,720
all have diversity we are all different

164
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,120
we have different experiences different

165
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,400
skill sets

166
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,039
different perspectives all of which make

167
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,600
us unique individuals in the world that

168
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,520
we live in today

169
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,160
now often it's that concept it's that

170
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,240
fact it's that reminder that's missing

171
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,319
in some of the narrative that we have we

172
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,800
can forget about it or overlook that

173
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,039
actually embracing diversity is about

174
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,919
embracing absolutely everybody that we

175
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,400
encounter in this space

176
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,319
now what i'd like to do is go through

177
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,479
the incident response life cycle

178
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,800
talk through some typical actions that

179
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,039
we take or we're involved in as incident

180
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,319
responders

181
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,280
highlight how sometimes we can not be as

182
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,919
inclusive as maybe we would hope or like

183
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,240
and then share some actionable tips to

184
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,199
take away and either implement them or

185
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,520
make sure you continue to do them within

186
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,520
your teams

187
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,560
so first up phase one preparation one of

188
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,120
my favorites of course as a previous

189
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,880
role was as a proactive incident

190
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,800
response consultant

191
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
so i want to take up here the training

192
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,840
aspect

193
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,720
so as an industry we're fantastic at

194
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,520
recognizing we want to continually train

195
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,199
up skill everybody around us

196
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,360
particularly our incident response

197
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,800
personnel

198
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,039
but what sometimes happens is we talk

199
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,520
about training or skill sets in this

200
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,479
space in quite a divisive manner often

201
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,080
without realizing

202
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,080
so for example we will talk about people

203
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,240
who have soft skills we will talk about

204
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,160
people who are non-technical

205
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,680
and actually when you look at the

206
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,599
connotations of those words and those

207
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,000
phrases we think you know soft can

208
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,080
sometimes mean lesser than

209
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,919
none can imply that you don't have

210
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,160
something that doesn't necessarily

211
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,319
foster an environment where people feel

212
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,160
they have a skill set that contributes

213
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,479
to this response effort

214
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,400
so it's so important to think about the

215
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,919
terminology that we use so for example

216
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,639
core skills or actually calling out

217
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,560
those non-technical skills for what they

218
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,720
actually are someone could be an amazing

219
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,039
collaborator fantastic at written

220
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,280
communication let's make sure that we

221
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,160
mention it so that everyone knows that

222
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,400
we appreciate it isn't just about one

223
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,000
particular area and that we know

224
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,039
everyone brings something to the table

225
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,919
secondly ir plans those plans and

226
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,640
playbooks so important to us and many of

227
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,360
us continually evolve review them work

228
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,519
from them and they're fantastic

229
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,680
but in my experience so far i've seen

230
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,279
them evolve in such a way that they've

231
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,080
become quite long lengthy documents on

232
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,399
multiple different documents

233
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,560
and sometimes that doesn't account for

234
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,560
the way that we may process information

235
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,839
differently

236
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,560
so actually how can we start to account

237
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,959
for the different styles in which people

238
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,760
process that information listen or hear

239
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
what they need to do

240
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,399
so

241
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,720
supplementary materials are so so

242
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,560
important in this space

243
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,800
think about the use of checklists for

244
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,839
example any visual or diagrams flow

245
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,720
charts or mind maps and even think about

246
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,200
videos or short recordings which might

247
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,800
give people

248
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,399
more of an insight and more be more

249
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,480
receptive to what it is that they need

250
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,720
to do in that space

251
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,800
and then finally in this phase we have

252
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,080
tabletop exercises a firm favorite of

253
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,240
many of us and many of our organizations

254
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,160
and they're incredibly beneficial when

255
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,240
we have that usually you know that half

256
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,040
day opportunity to talk through what we

257
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,200
would do in a response regardless of

258
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,480
what our role may be in that space but

259
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,720
sometimes we have to stay take a step

260
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,040
back to remember that actually

261
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,880
those scenarios where you have quite a

262
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,519
large group of people um you know

263
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,760
they're quite intimidating they can

264
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,440
create anxiety they can make people feel

265
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,160
like they don't have confidence to speak

266
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,399
so they're quite conducive to only those

267
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,959
who are confident enough to speak up in

268
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,399
front of others

269
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,920
and whilst we still want to be able to

270
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,320
do tabletops is about thinking about how

271
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,399
we create a safe environment for every

272
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,279
participant so it's always good to set

273
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,519
the ground rules to begin with explain

274
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,440
that it's not an individual test or an

275
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,560
assessment

276
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,959
but also remind all participants not

277
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,800
just the facilitators

278
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,120
that it's everyone's job to bring in

279
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,600
other views and other perspectives

280
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,360
you've probably been in a scenario where

281
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
you think i would love to hear from that

282
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,360
person about what they would do or if

283
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,160
they've experienced it before so why not

284
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,240
bring them in could be verbally you

285
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,160
could be doing a virtual exercise and

286
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,000
ask them to type in the chat

287
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
just consider how we can bring other

288
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,160
people and we don't have that that echo

289
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,920
chamber effect where it's just one or

290
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,800
two individuals who are confident enough

291
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,519
to keep speaking up

292
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,160
so let's move to phase two

293
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,560
detection and analysis

294
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,279
so incident declaration so we know we're

295
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,279
going to get to a point where we need to

296
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,920
declare that incident categorise it

297
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,920
think about the prioritization we need

298
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,200
to give

299
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,120
and usually at that point your core

300
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,760
responders or your first responders they

301
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,560
are operating with all hands on deck so

302
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,680
to speak

303
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,560
they are working relentlessly tirelessly

304
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,680
often extended working hours weekends

305
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,920
evenings and actually

306
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,519
those individuals could suffer from

307
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,240
burnout they may be sacrificing things

308
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,480
at home or in their personal lives which

309
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,920
are particularly challenging or

310
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,360
problematic

311
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,760
and it's important i think to make sure

312
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,079
that all of us consider the well-being

313
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,399
and the welfare of our responders right

314
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,920
from the onset

315
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,360
we need to make sure that they get the

316
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,519
rest the balance so that we get the

317
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,320
optimum response from them because often

318
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,160
as we all know if it's a significant

319
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,079
incident we're going to be at it for a

320
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,720
number of days weeks months and it's

321
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,959
really really difficult to sustain that

322
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,560
response effort

323
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,120
so thinking about how you support from a

324
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,440
welfare and well-being perspective is

325
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,600
about making sure your organizations

326
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,440
don't just rely on the good will of

327
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,839
people to respond in that manner

328
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,519
so look at your policies or your

329
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,680
technologies that you might employ how

330
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,160
that makes sure that the response effort

331
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,880
is

332
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,839
you know supportive and effective in the

333
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,320
early stages look at how you split your

334
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,079
incident response teams or you seek

335
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,480
support from the wider organization

336
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,279
or other trusted third parties

337
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,959
also bring hr in so so important make

338
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,360
sure that you can signpost and support

339
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,600
and simply ask each other is okay

340
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,519
then that usually takes us on to having

341
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,079
to stand up your incident response teams

342
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,639
so we're talking significant incident

343
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,560
you've got your core team maybe you've

344
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,959
got an extended team executive team and

345
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,839
even an external incident response team

346
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,839
and the very nature of significant

347
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,079
incidents is that actually we're going

348
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,320
to come across people who maybe

349
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,240
we've never met before we've never had

350
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,079
the pleasure of interacting we haven't

351
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,399
had a chance to do a tabletop and some

352
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,279
of the teams or individuals can make

353
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,120
assumptions about those people that they

354
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,240
come across

355
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,399
often completely unintended because

356
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,560
we're in the heat of the moment so for

357
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,800
example i've seen teams make assumptions

358
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,720
about where somebody might work what

359
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,959
team they represent so automatically

360
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,040
thinking someone must be from comms they

361
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,920
must be from hr they must be from legal

362
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,760
and equally assumptions about where

363
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,560
somebody is located or what time zone

364
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,839
they might be in

365
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,360
and even to the point of making

366
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,959
assumptions about how to pronounce

367
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,040
someone's name

368
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,440
so the value of introductions is

369
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,600
incredibly important when it comes to

370
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,920
inclusion in this aspect

371
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,399
recognizing someone is an individual it

372
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,480
doesn't need to take an hour it can be

373
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,399
very brief but it gives you as a

374
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,800
responder or as a manager an insight

375
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,240
right from the beginning about who

376
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,440
somebody is

377
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,880
when you need to interact with them

378
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,480
because actually you have clarity on

379
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,800
their role in the incident response

380
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,199
but also they feel part of something

381
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,959
you're collaborative from the get go and

382
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,040
you've recognized each individual

383
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,199
contribution

384
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,120
finally we have out of bands

385
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,399
communication

386
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,720
so many organizations will have systems

387
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,639
in place where you can text or

388
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,320
communicate with your entire

389
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,639
organization in a crisis

390
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,800
but many organizations i've worked with

391
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,279
over recent years have not always

392
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,639
considered the need for those

393
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,800
out-of-bands platforms where you can

394
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,560
collaborate and communicate as an

395
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,880
incident response team

396
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,040
and in those circumstances what happens

397
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,360
from an inclusion perspective

398
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,800
is

399
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,199
individuals are running around trying to

400
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,199
get personal phone numbers and details

401
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,279
for the rest of the team particularly if

402
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,000
you're remote dispersed around the world

403
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,839
and trying to bring them all together

404
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,760
and put them all into this one chat or

405
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,639
this one platform to collaborate

406
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,480
and what can inadvertently happen as a

407
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,199
result of that is people feel left out

408
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,519
from the initial response because maybe

409
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,160
uri had a personal relationship with

410
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,680
people because we've worked together in

411
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,920
the same city in the same team for a

412
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,279
long time so we brought them all

413
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,920
together but then two three four hours

414
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,240
later we then to get everybody else's

415
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,880
details and actually someone could feel

416
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,720
like they weren't important or they

417
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,680
don't have the same part to play

418
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,920
so it's really vital even from a

419
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,639
preparation perspective to think about

420
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,360
setting up those platforms test them

421
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,839
make sure everybody is included and

422
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,759
whilst that will help make the incident

423
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,000
much more effective and run smoothly it

424
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,079
will make sure that everybody is working

425
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,160
together and feeling like they are part

426
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,079
of that response from the beginning and

427
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,920
you'll get much more out of those

428
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,079
individuals they will feel much more

429
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,079
comfortable and of course there's great

430
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,959
business benefit

431
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,680
moving on to the third phase arguably

432
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,279
the the largest and one that has the

433
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,720
most actions

434
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,839
containment eradication and recovery

435
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,079
initial containment of course is one of

436
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,079
those huge topics particularly when

437
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,920
we're thinking significant incident or

438
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,120
ransomware

439
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,639
and often there's decisions or

440
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,880
conversations happening about measures

441
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,839
such as severing the internet connection

442
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,000
and of course that has huge business

443
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
impact not just for those core

444
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,160
responders but the wider operation of

445
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,079
the organization

446
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,240
and the very nature of that discussion

447
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,160
it could be brand new to somebody who

448
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,759
needs to be aware of that business

449
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,680
impact and then take some subsequent

450
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,959
action

451
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,440
so they're likely to have questions want

452
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,360
to seek some clarity want to understand

453
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,680
what the impact of that containment

454
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,360
measure may be

455
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,519
but often that's quite difficult to do

456
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,600
you know to ask questions about a topic

457
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,759
that you're not so familiar with that in

458
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,120
a you know a

459
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,279
time of huge pressure

460
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,720
and stress

461
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,199
heightened heightened situation where

462
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,520
you need to act so so quickly

463
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,679
and naturally then people will go to

464
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,480
seek advice or ask those questions to

465
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,319
people that they feel are like them

466
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,359
because they feel like there's an

467
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,000
affinity and it's safe to do that

468
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,919
and whilst that's so important and

469
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,000
that's great because you are able to

470
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,919
have a relationship to understand the

471
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,919
information that you need

472
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,080
it excludes the voices of others within

473
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,480
the incident response team

474
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,799
so it's incredibly important to think

475
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,520
about those containment strategies bring

476
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,080
everyone together in that non

477
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,000
incident environment to talk about the

478
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,960
measures their experiences someone you

479
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,120
know in the wider team may have been in

480
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,440
an organization previously dealt with

481
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,080
ransomware and able to share um some

482
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,760
sanitized information with someone

483
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,840
asking questions and that puts

484
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,000
everything in context so it's about

485
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,760
making sure that we're not only

486
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,520
proactive but everyone has an

487
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,520
opportunity to contribute to that

488
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,240
incident response effort

489
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,960
secondly tour deployment we're probably

490
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,880
going to need to roll out some tools and

491
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,520
technologies in our organizations to

492
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,080
either gain visibility or to collect

493
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,799
forensic data for example

494
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,600
now what i still hear fairly often in

495
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,160
the community is the term white listing

496
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,679
or black listing

497
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,160
and of course there's a huge push to

498
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,240
make sure that we have inclusive

499
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,480
terminology and quite rightly so because

500
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,960
of the connotations that are associated

501
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,120
with some of those phrases that exist

502
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,160
out there

503
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,160
so making sure that as a team as

504
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,000
management as people involved in

505
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,320
incident response that we keep up to

506
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,600
date with what's happening in the

507
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,919
diversity and inclusion community you

508
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,440
might have people in your team who are

509
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,280
advocates or who are part of your

510
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,600
employee resource group so make sure

511
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,280
that you're feeding into those and they

512
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,520
are being able to share updates like

513
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,000
this and you can have some approaches

514
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,320
and best practice employed throughout

515
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,559
your incident response effort

516
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,440
and finally briefings we're all likely

517
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,000
to need to contribute to a briefing or

518
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,160
even write one ourselves on a fairly

519
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,760
regular basis

520
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,320
but we all have a tendency sometimes to

521
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,720
assume some knowledge about cyber

522
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,880
but actually many people reading those

523
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,840
briefings might not be from our industry

524
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,679
it might be new to them but they're

525
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,360
probably going to be making some pretty

526
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,799
big decisions about the way the

527
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,200
organization responds

528
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,480
so it's so so important at this point to

529
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,960
remember not to assume that knowledge

530
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,280
make sure that we write our briefings

531
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,200
without acronyms or we explain the

532
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,840
acronyms that we add reference points so

533
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,600
people can take some time to just get

534
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,520
some additional context

535
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,400
or even appoint a technical subject

536
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,640
matter expert who can be that point of

537
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,120
contact for the rest of the organization

538
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,720
to openly and

539
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,360
comfortably and safely ask some of those

540
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,919
questions to seek clarity right from the

541
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,440
beginning so that they can make their

542
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,919
decisions properly understanding the

543
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,520
impact of the incident that you were

544
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,840
dealing with

545
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,559
and finally the final phase post

546
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,039
incident activity now i'm laughing to

547
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,520
myself because that's often the nice to

548
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,280
do not the need to do we've always got

549
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,679
competing priorities but of course we

550
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,320
know the absolute value in this part of

551
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,080
the life cycle

552
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,799
lessons learned many organizations will

553
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,120
want to understand what went wrong

554
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,200
and that tends to drive the approach to

555
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,640
lessons learned

556
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,640
and we want to know what went wrong

557
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,640
really quickly so that we can start to

558
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,720
do something about it and quite rightly

559
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,760
so

560
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,080
but sometimes that drive to find out

561
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,000
what what didn't go well

562
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,320
can mean that we we overlook that a

563
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,360
lessons learned initiative or project

564
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,039
can be really triggering for those who

565
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,799
are part of the response

566
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,400
they probably worried about whether

567
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,320
they'd done something wrong whether the

568
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,080
company was going to be able to exist

569
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,320
after the crisis what it meant for their

570
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,880
job how it meant from their work level

571
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,960
or level of effort perspective

572
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,520
so we have to remember that welfare

573
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,919
well-being making sure you can sign post

574
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,559
support during lessons learned is so

575
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,600
vital

576
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,480
but equally as is gaining additional

577
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,120
insights people are often worried about

578
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,039
providing information about what went

579
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,960
wrong so you need to consider

580
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,679
alternative ways about how to do that

581
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,039
not just a a form or a survey online but

582
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,520
give an option for anonymous mission

583
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,679
hold one to one so it's more personal

584
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,919
people respond better in that scenario

585
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,159
even consider group lessons learns our

586
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,320
group debriefing there's so many other

587
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,720
ways we can gain that insight but also

588
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,880
give that reassurance that some of our

589
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,840
incident responders may need

590
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,840
that then always tends to lead on to

591
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,000
improvements you come out with a whole

592
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
list of recommendations or things that

593
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,799
need to be changed from small specific

594
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,720
items all the way through to maybe

595
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,600
overhauling your security program

596
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,320
and again that's quite a focus on what

597
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,080
didn't go well

598
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,400
and sometimes to make sure that we are

599
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,039
inclusive and have a holistic approach

600
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,039
when it comes to response

601
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,080
think about the successes what went well

602
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,240
because naturally you will then be able

603
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,120
to recognize reward

604
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,960
pay attention to the good work that your

605
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,480
responders did

606
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,400
and not only then will you have a suite

607
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,159
of improvements that you can start to

608
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,080
implement you're going to have some

609
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,760
successes that you can make sure

610
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,320
embedded in the response effort because

611
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,919
we all know there may well have been

612
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,000
some successes that actually were

613
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,840
unintentional but we want to make sure

614
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,280
we do it again and actually indirect

615
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,520
consequence of that and that holistic

616
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,440
view from an improvement and success

617
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,720
perspective

618
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,360
is that actually your staff may start to

619
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,000
buy in to those improvements and may

620
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,240
even hold the hand up or express an

621
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,640
interest in leading a particular action

622
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,400
and of course then that means they are

623
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,559
part of something that they belong and

624
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,559
that they are vested in both the

625
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,960
reactive and proactive work in this

626
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,559
space

627
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,320
and then finally we have digital

628
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,600
technologies

629
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,799
so many of the tips or suggestions

630
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,120
are very much focused on people and

631
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,240
process

632
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,280
but actually they can be implemented or

633
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,280
you can even instigate some of this work

634
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,600
from an inclusion perspective by using

635
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,000
the technology that you have so let's

636
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,159
take communication platform as an

637
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,360
example you may well be able to

638
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,760
turn on some of the features that allow

639
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,480
people to input their time zones to put

640
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,799
some pronouns to put their work in

641
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,760
preferred hours to even explain how to

642
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,279
spell the name

643
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,760
little things like that very simple but

644
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,480
incredibly significant in recognizing

645
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,320
everyone that's around

646
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,640
it's also good to get used to transcript

647
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,000
functions or even think about how you

648
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,919
have colour contrasts in your power

649
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,880
points or how you run the accessibility

650
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,279
function when you finish composing your

651
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,640
great content

652
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,159
there's so much out there from a

653
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,799
technology perspective and so much

654
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,919
commitment to being inclusive by design

655
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,760
we probably haven't taken note of

656
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,000
everything that's available to us so

657
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,159
there's lots there in that space

658
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,720
now there's plenty that has been covered

659
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,559
but as a recap and if there was one

660
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,640
slide actually that you could photograph

661
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,760
or take away it would be this one

662
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,120
because certainly couldn't put all the

663
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,480
content in one and actually this is

664
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,720
about making sure that we acknowledge

665
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,600
everybody that we build belonging that

666
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,679
we are consciously considerate of those

667
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,400
around us and that we delve deeper into

668
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,640
the topic into the technologies into the

669
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,840
processes

670
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,240
it's really important that we recognize

671
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,120
that being simple with our approach can

672
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,760
have huge significant impact on how

673
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,000
people feel how they feel that sense of

674
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,480
belonging and allow themselves to be

675
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,760
part of that incident response effort

676
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,080
now we talked right at the start about

677
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,400
the direct benefit of threat

678
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,000
intelligence or intelligence-led

679
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,760
activity when it comes to incident

680
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,039
response

681
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,360
and actually what i hope this talk can

682
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,080
do

683
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,320
is start to generate that thinking about

684
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,720
how inclusive practices and being

685
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,400
intentional about our inclusive

686
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,200
behaviors can of course have that direct

687
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,400
positive impact on incident response

688
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,240
because if we can communicate

689
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
effectively right from the beginning we

690
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,880
can collaborate better people feel part

691
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,440
of something and then our decisions they

692
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,279
are sound decisions where people have

693
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,760
sought clarity in a really comfortable

694
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,640
way

695
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,720
now we know of course it makes business

696
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,440
sense uh for diversity and inclusion

697
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,360
we're quite good in this space

698
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,320
understanding why we need to do it but

699
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,240
what i hope this talk has done has

700
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,039
mentioned what you can do some specific

701
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,720
key actions or takeaways in that space

702
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,120
but then often people wonder well how do

703
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,120
you do it how do we make sure we can

704
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,400
think about this

705
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,640
all the time in all our interactions no

706
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,039
matter how big how small

707
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,600
how can we implement this all the time

708
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,000
well it's about assuming less and asking

709
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,880
more

710
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,240
i think if we take that that mantra it's

711
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,400
stripped back it's simple

712
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,120
but every time we approach something an

713
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,000
interaction a situation an action a

714
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,200
process a task whatever it may be if we

715
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,480
take a moment to just sense check

716
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,799
see if we are assuming something in this

717
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,799
situation and ask more seek some clarity

718
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,720
get that information from those around

719
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,440
you and then by that point we will move

720
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,320
into much more intentional inclusive

721
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,919
behaviors

722
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,200
so i will pause there and ask if anyone

723
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,640
has any questions

724
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,799
i'm also very eager to go and enjoy the

725
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,240
evening so no obligation

726
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,360
great presentation thanks for that

727
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,919
a quick question so i as a person i have

728
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,240
blind spots

729
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,760
when someone points out a blind spot i

730
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,240
don't know if i react the right way

731
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,919
and so from a diversity point of view is

732
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,520
there any advice that you've seen or

733
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,039
you've ran into

734
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,279
on how to give yourself time to consider

735
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,640
what's being said without being

736
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,360
offensive and then come back with the

737
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,120
right response and i don't mean like

738
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,480
thank you that was nice i'll talk to you

739
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,480
tomorrow i mean like if there's some

740
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,159
some formula you can follow for the

741
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,559
first minute or two to get you that that

742
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,039
space to get into the right mindset yeah

743
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,480
definitely great question

744
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,960
and so we often overlook the importance

745
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,159
of listening

746
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,000
so taking that time to hear what

747
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,520
somebody is saying

748
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,440
but before you can get to that point i

749
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,600
would say that you have to build trust

750
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,840
with those around you often people won't

751
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,600
come out to talk about something that

752
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,000
they've experienced or that they want to

753
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,760
explain to you because they don't have

754
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,000
trust so you're in a good position so

755
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,240
far if you've been able to build that up

756
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,720
so being conscious about that and

757
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,399
explaining that you do want to hear

758
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,720
about it and that you listen and

759
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,960
understand what they're saying and you

760
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,039
don't have to always give a response you

761
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,679
can take it on board and it depends how

762
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,360
the conversation might go they may want

763
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,320
to

764
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,320
explain certain things you you may be

765
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,640
able to consider going forward so

766
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,240
there's lots of different ways but i

767
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,399
would say the number one approach would

768
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,039
be just just to listen and really hear

769
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,360
and ask questions because they want to

770
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,600
talk about it if they if they've brought

771
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,279
it to your attention

772
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,440
and nourish that opportunity because it

773
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,399
takes a lot for people to you know to to

774
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,360
approach or to highlight something so

775
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,880
recognize that

776
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,799
and they will be more than receptive to

777
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,640
continuing the conversation and that's

778
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,000
certainly what i've seen so far

779
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,080
love the presentation emma thank you

780
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,799
in some cases in incident response we

781
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,200
may have some

782
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,279
very aggressive

783
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,600
folk members of management

784
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,720
and more

785
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,279
timid technical folks that report to

786
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,000
them

787
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,240
how do you draw the

788
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,840
nuggets of information you know that

789
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,919
they have uh the technical folks to uh

790
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,320
bear on the problem when you have those

791
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,480
overbearing managers how do you make

792
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,640
them feel like they're heard

793
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,480
or can be heard and can weigh in on the

794
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,600
problem yeah great question thanks um so

795
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,159
it's definitely about reading the room

796
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,159
and so i went to a great talk last night

797
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,080
and someone talked about how we should

798
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,240
be the chameleon and recognize what's

799
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,039
happening in any given environment and i

800
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,279
think if you're able to pick up on those

801
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,840
challenges or imbalances it's about

802
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,240
finding a variety of ways to get

803
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,880
people's input and contributions so it

804
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,039
may be that you recognize a particular

805
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,480
approach where you have everybody

806
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,120
together is is not working well so then

807
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,120
you might have to adapt your style or

808
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,720
your way of communicating and

809
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,520
interacting to bring people into a

810
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,080
different forum or introduce someone to

811
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,240
ones and a lot of that will then build

812
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
the trust and you will be able to

813
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,840
represent others

814
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,919
if that's the best approach when when

815
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,720
doing so but creating safe environments

816
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,039
is certainly is something to consider as

817
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,840
well so often we have to really set the

818
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,200
tone for a conversation even if it's in

819
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,440
a really pressurized environment or if

820
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,360
something happens that

821
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,679
you know is inappropriate it's also

822
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,000
about being able to acknowledge that not

823
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,679
to just stand by and let something

824
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,559
happen

825
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,919
but finding different ways of of having

826
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,480
certain conversations or closing certain

827
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,559
aspects down and bringing other people

828
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,120
in um is definitely sort of some of the

829
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,279
advice or where i've seen it happen

830
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,960
really well so far

831
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,399
in the beginning you talked about the

832
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,640
implicit bias that people have for soft

833
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,360
skills and non-technical skills

834
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,399
when you start bringing a team together

835
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:15,679
how do you

836
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,360
set the stage for saying how folks as

837
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,519
part of the introduction how different

838
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,200
parts of the organization whether it's

839
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,279
in the technical hr

840
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,679
legal or

841
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,320
communications field

842
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,279
set that

843
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,600
where everyone has that kind of a

844
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,240
feeling of being a part of it without

845
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,120
embarrassing someone definitely so it

846
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,440
all comes back to that prepare or that

847
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,240
proactive interaction and we

848
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,000
when we're in that heightened state and

849
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,440
you're trying to work together and

850
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,679
understand who does what and we can

851
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,440
often overlook all the things we need to

852
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,279
be more conscious of

853
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,120
so if you've got environments where you

854
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,120
can bring people together

855
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,279
you know in a safer space in a quieter

856
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,360
space and give everyone an opportunity

857
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,039
to talk about who they are as an

858
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,600
individual start at that point and then

859
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,440
let them explain to other people about

860
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,519
what their specific role is within an

861
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,519
incident and by doing that and bringing

862
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,200
everybody together there's an option

863
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,600
then for you know for those who who are

864
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,120
on the other side of the response to

865
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,279
actually hear and listen what somebody

866
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,600
else's role may be and a lot of that is

867
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,080
supplemented by you know the formalities

868
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,240
and what exists in the incident response

869
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,480
plans for example and having roles

870
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,799
responsibilities and accountabilities

871
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,320
but it's about bringing the humans and

872
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,519
the people into that aspect too

873
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,320
thank you thanks

874
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,960
okay

875
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,200
i think we shall pause there i just want

876
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,200
to say a huge thank you for coming to

877
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,960
listen and hopefully something you can

878
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,960
take away with you and you'll see there

879
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,640
on the bottom of the screen one of my

880
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,720
favorite quotes from a philosopher

881
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,880
called simonville and they say that

882
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,760
attention is the rarest and purest form

883
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,090
of generosity thank you

884
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:06,159
[Applause]

885
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,799
thank you
