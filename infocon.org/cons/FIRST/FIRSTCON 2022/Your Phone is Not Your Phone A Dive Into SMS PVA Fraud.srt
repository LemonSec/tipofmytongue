1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,620
foreign

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,320
please find your seat

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,119
and yeah there are plenty of them we are

4
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,580
in this nice beautiful huge Auditorium

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,519
my name is

6
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:25,199
the head of Latin National scissor time

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,580
sharing this session and it's my great

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,560
honor and privilege to welcome the next

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,020
speaker Vladimir kropotov he's a

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,280
researcher with a Trend Micro

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,520
forward-looking threat research team and

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,680
the presentation that we will have now

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,680
is about your mobile phones that might

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,960
be that your mobile phone is not your

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,460
mobile phone

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,960
and I think it's a very

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,780
exciting and also worrying topic because

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,940
we rely so much on our mobile phones

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,640
nowadays so please Vladimir tell us more

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,460
why it can be so that my mobile phone is

21
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,320
not my mobile phone welcome

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,640
so let's start with a simple question uh

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,920
I know we are insecurity and what means

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,780
sometimes we're traveling with Burner

25
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,080
laptops sometimes we have burner phones

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,720
or whatever so please raise your hand if

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,960
you use more than one mobile phone in

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,500
your life regularly or occasionally

29
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,040
uh please lower your hand if your second

30
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,500
mobile phone costs more than 500 dollars

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,939
okay

32
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,000
so so so so the thing is that this talk

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,380
is about

34
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,200
um actually

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,899
a dive into

36
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,560
a combination of abuse of SMS lending

37
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,520
services and it has uh supply chain

38
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,939
angle and the reason why we're talking

39
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,100
here we discovered a group which were

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,680
able to compromise millions of mobile

41
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,239
devices and we climb in availability for

42
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,840
monetization obvious devices in over 180

43
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,599
countries so roughly everyone in the

44
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,920
world and one of the target audience is

45
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,140
the security researchers and security

46
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,500
Personnel who bind shipping phones cheap

47
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,319
phones as a burner phones but in some

48
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,860
cases where phones are infected so all

49
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,260
the security measures are broken and

50
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,720
that's why we call this presentation

51
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,200
your phone is a not your phone

52
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,019
so this is the brief agenda we'll have

53
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,920
introduction dive into one group uh we

54
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,640
analyze it mostly impacts for uh

55
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,260
different groups like phone producers

56
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,159
like people who own the phones and for

57
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:02,580
the portals which using SMS for

58
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,860
confirmation but there is a slightly

59
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,519
wider scope So This research was done by

60
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,680
the group of researchers from three

61
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,900
teams intern Micra including me further

62
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,680
yarajkin Paul paharis Ryan Flores and

63
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,940
gen yodon

64
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,319
so and I'm presenting This research here

65
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,379
so the topic of supply chain attacks

66
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,099
is hot but it becomes way more

67
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,860
interesting uh when we come into the

68
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,739
root of trust because normally what

69
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,659
happened with the phones uh with

70
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,060
computers we're buying those phones or

71
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,159
computers and when we start to protect

72
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,879
them but what happened if this phone uh

73
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,680
or mobile device

74
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,620
it arrives already pre-infected what's

75
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,720
another story we're in our threat model

76
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,599
and uh

77
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,360
with for our point of view is way more

78
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,220
dangerous

79
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,260
so let's look into a historical overview

80
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,659
and the story didn't start pretty

81
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:10,260
recently and it has a Roots When Android

82
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,080
operation system was released as an open

83
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,959
source in September 2008.

84
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,820
and slightly out of it we see

85
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,880
appearance of Rome so call it Rome

86
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,580
reflection services

87
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,040
which infect your phone because before

88
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,000
it was sold to the customers

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,280
and

90
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,400
you can think about this uh like what

91
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,460
was a big capabilities to produce mobile

92
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,460
phones as Hardware but to sell them

93
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,160
there was a need for customization of

94
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,259
the firmware images

95
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:53,060
for Brands and everybody wanted to buy

96
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,580
cheap good and fast phone

97
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,400
so sometimes you can see the phones with

98
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,520
fake photo cameras or whatever

99
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,699
but no money left for a software company

100
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,520
component and the sellers were forced to

101
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,600
sell the phones cheaper and their idea

102
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,759
was yes I will sell this one cheaper but

103
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,580
I refresh this phone before selling it

104
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,120
and will monetize this phone later

105
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,699
so what was the business model which

106
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,820
bring us to the situation when phones

107
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,940
initially were pre-infected but it was

108
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,400
phone by phone before selling in the

109
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,639
small shops or wherever

110
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,780
and this model evolved over last decade

111
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,320
so to go forward we need to introduce uh

112
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,960
some terms which we'll use in our

113
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,620
presentation OEM is a original equipment

114
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,180
manufacturer so with the company which

115
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,759
produce equipment on own specification

116
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,400
you can think about lgo Samsung in this

117
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,240
case

118
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,900
odm is original design manufacturer and

119
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,020
the difference between them is with the

120
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,199
use case for this odm is mostly

121
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,380
when you see the companies like big

122
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,900
retailers retailers or telecoms which

123
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,080
are selling uh phones with their own

124
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,600
brands so we came in coming to the

125
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,400
factory and saying I need the phone at

126
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,919
this price range with this functionality

127
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,979
and I need to put the label on the phone

128
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:32,460
so photo Auto is a firmware over the air

129
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,680
or software over the air and the main

130
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,080
function is to be capable to update

131
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,419
device after it was shipped to the

132
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:40,319
customer

133
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,220
and PVE is a phone verified accounts

134
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,919
with accounts which use it by many

135
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,940
portals to avoid appearance of the boats

136
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,139
to link accounts to a particular person

137
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:57,360
and what's the general model

138
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,039
of PVE

139
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,880
so and the trade groups were not OEM or

140
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,740
odm producers

141
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,699
while we are in some cases a business

142
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,759
partner so what we do we come into OEM

143
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,039
odm

144
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,900
vendors and saying we are ready to help

145
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,840
you with customization with customized

146
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,780
images for the phones and one of the

147
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,080
options we silently implant extra

148
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,900
functionality which allows them to

149
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,818
monetize those phones later

150
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,919
so and

151
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,940
the key feature of

152
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,220
those pre-infected phones is what

153
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,879
malware is activated on the boot and

154
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,360
that means what really hard to

155
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,180
remove this malware without refreshing

156
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,879
the phone and there are options to

157
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,520
detect some malware companies but it's

158
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,860
mostly plugins uploaded to the phone

159
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,000
later

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,120
so and mostly locals devices are

161
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,900
affected and kind of Brands ordered by

162
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,759
odm programs

163
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,039
triada and gorilla are prevalent

164
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,620
families but were many hours our

165
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,879
families

166
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,500
there

167
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,819
so the timeline uh which is shown here

168
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,599
is an incident with incidents which

169
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,419
happened over last decade

170
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,940
and we can start this with a silent

171
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,958
plugin in 2011 2012

172
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:38,159
and the good news is that the group

173
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,559
which created this plugin was arrested

174
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,039
in China in 2013 and

175
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,880
in 2015 the news a period and exposed

176
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,180
the details of the operation when over

177
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,640
20 million contacts were stolen from the

178
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,260
phones and 400 000 devices were affected

179
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,339
by this campaign

180
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,920
so in this case 10 individuals were

181
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,760
arrested and there were three companies

182
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,160
which fulfill all business process for

183
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,980
monetizing the phones so one company was

184
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,339
responsible for ROM images uh

185
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,100
was one company was the App Store

186
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,100
developer and one company was used to

187
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,320
promote the applications to infect more

188
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,800
phones

189
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,160
so and if we go to the timeline further

190
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,440
we can see appearance of triada more and

191
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,279
more often it was mentioned by Kaspersky

192
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,380
it was it's what mentioned by our

193
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,320
vendors and we can see roughly one two

194
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,399
incidents per year related to uh supply

195
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,760
chain or pre-installed malware on the

196
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,380
phones

197
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,899
so here is the example of the news in

198
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,940
Africa when

199
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,339
the phones were pre-installed with

200
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:00,360
malware

201
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,720
and whereas in our example which is more

202
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,560
recent with gigaset in this case uh Auto

203
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,820
supplier Redstone in China was probably

204
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,620
the reason because we found

205
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,959
some package names with which called

206
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,399
like com.redstone dot Auto dot UI which

207
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,640
were malicious and probably and since

208
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,980
gigaset used this supplier for the

209
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,940
update this is the probably the case

210
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,800
for for the order updates used to infect

211
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,800
the phones what is important to notice

212
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,279
that not only smartphones are targeted

213
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,700
but traditional phones are also targeted

214
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,600
and this is the case when about 5

215
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,620
million uh traditional phones were spot

216
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,720
infected in China

217
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,100
and the article is from 2019 and in this

218
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,980
case

219
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,940
developer software developer and the

220
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,800
producer of

221
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,100
uh the the boards for the phones were

222
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,399
arrested together with 14 suspects

223
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,860
which purchased it uh personal

224
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,440
information stolen from the phones

225
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,779
so to summarize what are the major

226
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,640
supply chain attack reactors on the

227
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,459
phones it's pre-infected from devices

228
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:35,760
it's photo auto updates

229
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,120
and what is important it's a software

230
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,000
supply chain like sdks from the third

231
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,560
parties

232
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,200
and example of SDK infection is Epica

233
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,220
APK pure so with the store which is

234
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,139
alternative to Google

235
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:56,880
a Play Store

236
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,339
and it use it zcope SDK and on the right

237
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:03,560
side

238
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,839
you can see several screenshots we've

239
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,240
encrypted malicious preload with the

240
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,760
launch of decryption code

241
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,180
and the part of the code of encrypted

242
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,180
payloads so the incident is public so

243
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,180
and you can find the news about this

244
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,620
incident

245
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,040
so but let's go to the group of interest

246
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,339
uh so-called lemon group

247
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:32,639
so and the group calls itself lemon

248
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,760
group and the part of the infrastructure

249
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,040
is also crosses over with word lemon

250
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,639
so here is the post on

251
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:47,279
4pd.to where person who purchased a new

252
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,860
phone discussion whether this phone

253
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,120
sends the content of the sms's to the

254
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,480
server lemon99.com

255
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,600
and it happened right out the box so the

256
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,139
phone come pre-infected

257
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,320
and there are many posts like this uh

258
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,180
about phones with Brands related to odm

259
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,160
producers

260
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,880
so for us the first encounter of lemon

261
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,579
group was through Facebook advertisement

262
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:23,519
which offered a very cheap SMS

263
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,279
confirmation code at extremely low price

264
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,380
and

265
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,380
this attracted our attention because uh

266
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,980
for normal SMS confirmations in boxes I

267
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,880
use it and the owner of the service need

268
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,100
to maintain

269
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,220
dozens of SIM cards and

270
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,920
the pro the cost of the operation is too

271
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,279
high to have this low price uh for the

272
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,860
SMS Lending

273
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,920
we were also

274
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,380
advertisement of free SMS Verification

275
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,779
codes and I can't imagine the business

276
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:03,959
model which makes profitable free SMS

277
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,339
confirmation

278
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:08,480
and uh

279
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,180
the same group also advertised a paid

280
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,180
services and the advertisement was in

281
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,199
2018 on the YouTube in 2020

282
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,160
on the Facebook uh and uh

283
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,579
the fin is the Facebook page advertise

284
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:32,040
it over 300 000 unique numbers in more

285
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,480
than uh 100 countries and promise it to

286
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,880
provide up to Million numbers in coming

287
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,019
weeks

288
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,360
so with the skill you are unable to

289
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,180
maintain in the same boxes so it was

290
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,880
something else

291
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,660
so the peat platform

292
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:54,959
provided dozens of services and when

293
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,740
it's saying Services it's services like

294
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,459
Amazon Facebook Gmail Twitter which use

295
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:05,820
SMS confirmation in dozens of countries

296
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,760
and uh

297
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,000
it's also provided API

298
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,600
ah which allow to scale the operation

299
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,220
and create and gave an ability to create

300
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,500
thousands of fake accounts

301
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,540
uh just using a pre-programmit code

302
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,680
so the general functionality is request

303
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,019
a phone number uh

304
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:37,380
when a receiver code release the phone

305
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,860
number and there is also options to

306
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,199
block particular number if service

307
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,360
doesn't work for this number because the

308
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,339
number was already in use

309
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,920
and there are options to choose a

310
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,860
particular locations

311
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,860
for the phone numbers needed and the

312
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,139
services

313
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:00,420
in the terms of this platform uh call it

314
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,560
as a projects

315
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,000
so and while exploring the

316
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,420
infrastructure of this group uh we were

317
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,839
we we got a sample which had

318
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,019
capabilities to intercept SMS we pivoted

319
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:18,060
over the infrastructure and what we

320
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,519
found what do you think was a staging

321
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,480
server

322
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,940
where was not so no so many collection

323
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,120
connections while many samples and with

324
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,459
different variants of gorilla linked to

325
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:30,660
this

326
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,699
so and

327
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:35,880
while collecting a variety of sample

328
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,540
samples uh analyzing infrastructure we

329
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,240
were able to support how the group how

330
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,180
old those things are operating

331
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,440
so it was a pre-installed loader and

332
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,380
there was plugin architecture and what

333
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,519
is interesting in all those cases with

334
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,519
pre-infected phones

335
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,880
where is a logic that prevents exposure

336
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,539
of infection at early stages

337
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:08,939
which means if phone is just unpacked in

338
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,699
the shop and it's on the test mode in

339
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:15,020
the shop it shouldn't expose some

340
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,240
suspicious Behavior an example of this

341
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,619
logic could be a number of the pictures

342
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:24,780
stored on the phone so for example if

343
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,419
phone have more than 50 pictures

344
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,120
when phone is in active use and what

345
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,299
means what's probably the time to

346
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:35,460
initiate C2 Communications

347
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,480
and what's the reason why the phone uh

348
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,160
probably or the malware not exposed

349
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,220
suspicious behavior in the sandboxes in

350
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,620
the test because there are some triggers

351
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,500
before this activity

352
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,299
of course

353
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:56,520
and plugins have different functions

354
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,140
initially we saw SMS interception later

355
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,039
we support proxy services and there was

356
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,980
some other options

357
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,780
to which allow to commit scum fraud

358
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,120
interception of credentials which will

359
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,120
touch a bit later but putting all

360
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,640
together like from the bottom you can

361
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,740
see

362
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,320
the ROM and when the main plug-in and

363
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,080
our plugins which we support related to

364
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,439
this group

365
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,200
so let's look into how acquisition of

366
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,460
sms's is done

367
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,380
so if you're logging into the portal

368
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,179
you need to choose the project and the

369
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:46,799
project is the service for which you

370
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,340
create an account

371
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,860
and after that

372
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,720
uh

373
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,320
you you can initiate a registration in

374
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,080
this service and as long as you go to

375
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,900
the field where you need to enter a

376
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,480
phone you can request the phone number

377
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,780
from this platform

378
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,500
type this number in the service unit and

379
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,100
uh push send confirmation SMS button or

380
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,299
wherever it's called

381
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:21,600
so after that a lemon platform provide

382
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,400
you

383
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,039
the confirmation code and creation of

384
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,679
account can be continued we put an

385
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,140
automation tools which allow to do this

386
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,080
in bulk I like to create hundreds of

387
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,080
accounts just by pushing one button and

388
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,580
have enough money

389
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,980
on Lemon platform

390
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,700
and what is interesting what happens

391
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,280
with the phone which is not your phone

392
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,640
so what happened uh the platform choose

393
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,580
a phone in the country from the pool

394
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,960
available

395
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,740
and then it sends a regular expression

396
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,659
uh to the capture particle or service

397
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,980
SMS messenger

398
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,559
and blocks the phone for five minutes in

399
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,740
those five minutes if SMS is landed and

400
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,500
this SMS is much in the service

401
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,520
requested only in this case the SMS will

402
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,700
not be visible to the owner of the phone

403
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,000
and the content of SMS will be sent back

404
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,720
to the platform and reuse it well for

405
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,679
any our smss it will be visible for the

406
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,620
owner so what's the strategy to defend

407
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,320
the platform from detection of

408
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,539
infections

409
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:43,620
so here are some code snip sets related

410
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,880
to

411
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,320
SMS interception and

412
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,760
the malware using start Hook by

413
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,780
activity Management Service and as I

414
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,580
told it just block the phone for a short

415
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,280
period of time and when it releases so

416
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,140
we'll go back to the business model

417
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,799
slightly later while to estimate the

418
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,320
scale of the operations

419
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,400
so you can see the project IDs in the

420
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,980
Telemetry if you look at and there were

421
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,620
over a thousand unique project IDs that

422
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,840
means over a thousand regular

423
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,280
expressions

424
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,220
which are capable to capture sms's on

425
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,760
the phones

426
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,580
so here is an example of jindon

427
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,100
e-commerce site which uh

428
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,860
decided to provide some bonuses if you

429
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,020
register

430
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,640
and

431
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,700
on the left side where and the Finish

432
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,120
but it permitted to use sms's from

433
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,320
different countries or phone numbers

434
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,059
from different countries

435
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:55,200
uh to sign in and on the right side with

436
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,380
some numbers which will Sports uh in our

437
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,620
Telemetry and for different countries

438
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,260
related to abuse of this service through

439
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,200
the lemon PVA platform so you can see

440
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,179
Thailand was pretty popular with over

441
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:10,320
five

442
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,939
thousand cases

443
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:18,360
so what we spot later with the lemon

444
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,919
group

445
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,000
also sells a proxies residential and

446
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,080
mobile proxies and we think that

447
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,880
residential proxies was our Android

448
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,159
devices connected through Wi-Fi

449
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,500
while mobile proxies are devices

450
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,799
connected to mobile

451
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,400
infrastructure

452
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,700
and what is

453
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,080
interesting here is if you think how a

454
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,360
World's credit card fraud versus like

455
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,840
stolen credit cards use it uh so we need

456
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,340
the proxies with precise locations to

457
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,020
bypass anti-fraud system

458
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,480
and mobile phones is a perfect

459
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,580
opportunity to give those proxies

460
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,159
because we have GPS so you know location

461
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:06,780
with

462
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,179
quite High quite High Precision normally

463
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,760
with like several hundred meters at

464
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,600
least

465
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:17,100
so what's can be abused by a variety of

466
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,020
ways

467
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:25,080
and the proxy plugin uses sox5 protocol

468
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,520
and it provides to the customer the IP

469
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,580
address Sport and token for Access and

470
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,820
timeout

471
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,340
uh at which or like time time period at

472
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,620
which the account can be used

473
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,000
so and this combination of lending

474
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,640
sms's with a precise proxy locations

475
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,880
available in over 100 countries

476
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,340
which is something uh pretty important

477
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:59,418
and opens a way for variety of Roads

478
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,020
so what we found with

479
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,480
this lemon and Dove proxies related to

480
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,059
the same company in Hainan China

481
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,120
and where several business

482
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,120
sites which we have and we share it is

483
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,760
with law enforcement

484
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,080
so and to estimate the scale actually we

485
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,460
can say that

486
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,480
just in Bangladesh this Dove proxy

487
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,720
service climate to have 100

488
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,600
000 unique IP addresses so it's just a

489
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,539
one country and just a number for you to

490
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,720
remember

491
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:42,900
and what is also important here this

492
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,320
group try to avoid detections and try to

493
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,120
not to be noisy that's why we're

494
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,260
restricted the interception of sms's

495
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,720
uh just to the list of regular

496
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,240
Expressions otherwise the phones will be

497
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,179
abused uh at the bigger scale and the

498
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,279
owners of the phones will detect the

499
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,659
infection

500
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:06,779
uh the recent development uh with this

501
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:09,179
group since we already published a part

502
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:12,419
of our research is that the group was

503
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:14,640
lemon SMS and

504
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,820
recent weeks we are rebranded into

505
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,539
durian Cloud SMS and the way renaming

506
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:23,279
your infrastructure

507
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,000
well we still have capabilities to track

508
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,679
them

509
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:31,860
so let's see what is impact of

510
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,620
compromised phones and it's slightly

511
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,460
bigger when just SMS interception so

512
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,200
first of all it's a capabilities to

513
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,480
initiate an unauthentic Behavior so

514
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,240
something which could spread sales

515
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,460
information disinformation promote

516
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,140
different messages

517
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,179
of course it's abuse of signing bonuses

518
00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:01,020
in some cases its abilities to bypass

519
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,020
Regional restrictions like if Bitcoin is

520
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,059
not

521
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:07,440
permitted in particular country probably

522
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,440
the Bitcoin platforms uh limited

523
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,419
limiting the phone numbers from this

524
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:14,940
country from registering accounts

525
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,320
so of course it's come fraud and where

526
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,500
many our options so what is important

527
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,200
here with our phones so when you're

528
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,840
buying a SIM card you often need to show

529
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,460
your ID

530
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,400
and what means that you phone your phone

531
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,500
in many countries is your digital

532
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,059
identity

533
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:37,440
and

534
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,620
this means what any actions done with

535
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,500
this phone is actually actions done with

536
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,380
your digital identity and one of the

537
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,520
examples here if your phone will be used

538
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,200
to register account in the car sharing

539
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,159
portal

540
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:55,440
there might be some extra work but where

541
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,600
a lot of liquid scans of documents

542
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,039
actually so when some criminal buy an

543
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,620
access to this car sharing portal and

544
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,440
crash the car you will be the first

545
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,559
person who will be responsible

546
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,360
for this and who will be approached by

547
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,480
law enforcement so for anonymity of

548
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,720
course criminals use it proxies but we

549
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,580
also use some time and think about

550
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,460
buying a proxy from the group which

551
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,640
intercepts everything from the phone or

552
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,039
capable to intercept everything from the

553
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,039
phone so there is no

554
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:35,159
actually options to keep your anonymity

555
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:38,760
there what is the interesting where new

556
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,640
developments uh with this group start to

557
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,940
collect the WhatsApp access tokens

558
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,600
and this group also

559
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,000
collects Facebook cookies which use it

560
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,299
for authentication and which low to

561
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:57,299
initiate parallel sex session to the

562
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:00,059
Facebook accounts of real people and

563
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:01,580
that means

564
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,260
if somebody needs to provide some

565
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,419
message or promote some messages on the

566
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:09,059
Facebook platform we can use accounts of

567
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:11,340
real people with real Behavior with real

568
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,799
history and initiate parallel sessions

569
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,299
and

570
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:18,600
uh abuse this so of course abuse of

571
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,740
signing bonuses was a case in 2018 in

572
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,640
China when Starbucks

573
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,860
decided to provide coupons for a free

574
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,159
cup of coffee

575
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:34,320
for the people who registered in their

576
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,960
mobile application and what happened

577
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,940
around

578
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,179
400 000 disposable accounts were

579
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,700
registered in one day and when those

580
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,120
coupons where it sold and was the way it

581
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,000
was monetized

582
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,659
so there are impacts to different groups

583
00:28:53,659 --> 00:28:57,360
and of course the impact to the Privacy

584
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,760
so if you bought both phones like this

585
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,679
this is not your phone

586
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,840
and you will be probably the first

587
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,240
person uh who will be contacted by law

588
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,539
enforcement in the case of the frauds uh

589
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,240
uh from your phone from your phone

590
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,440
number

591
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,440
and you can be impersonated in variety

592
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,659
of social media networks or Messengers

593
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:22,080
and we may be might be more serious

594
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,720
illegal action actions from the

595
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,039
criminals

596
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:29,220
so lessons for the platforms uh one time

597
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,980
SMS is not enough

598
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,159
and be cautionless when you initiate

599
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,080
promotion campaigns because there are

600
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,840
many cases uh when those campaigns were

601
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,000
abused and having access to Millions

602
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,080
phones and over 100 of countries it's a

603
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,480
big opportunity for criminals to abuse

604
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,460
the promotion campaigns

605
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,740
in any countries

606
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:57,240
uh what is really important uh you know

607
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,059
like in the context like phone to own

608
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:02,700
you can hear there was like chain in the

609
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,740
box or chaining the vulnerabilities to

610
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,440
exploit them zero they like to hack

611
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,279
MacBook or iPhone so here by regising

612
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,700
why one account and exploiting this

613
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,700
chaining of single sign-on where is an

614
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,220
option for criminals to monetize uh

615
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,100
access to many services also and this is

616
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,080
important to keep in mind

617
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,039
so for brands of course remember the

618
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,480
major attack vectors and

619
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,220
where we'll be always suppliers and

620
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,360
contractors and you need to verify and

621
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,520
regularly double check

622
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,600
if something is changed and because

623
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,720
otherwise it will be a big reputation

624
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,360
impact so it's not the way you can save

625
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,460
the money

626
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,659
so and

627
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,519
what we need to keep in mind also is

628
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,200
that

629
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,019
we need to have a security process

630
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:06,480
processes in place

631
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:12,120
so online anonymity uh as and was a

632
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,980
verified account with kind of

633
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,220
double-edged Sword so if you decide to

634
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,679
register it like account for like some

635
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,399
criminal Forum or something uh like to

636
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,840
investigate the cases and use their

637
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,380
services you can expose

638
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,600
a random person in the world and law

639
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,299
enforcement will come to this person

640
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:37,140
and for law enforcement also we need to

641
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,640
track at early stage of the

642
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,240
investigation whereas the real uh

643
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,059
suspect or it was the person who was

644
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:47,760
whose phone was abused

645
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,559
and

646
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:53,039
the scale of infections uh gives a big

647
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,080
opportunity actually for criminals to

648
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,380
monetize these excesses with a variety

649
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,059
of ways

650
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:03,000
so and also the recent developments of

651
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,460
the group when we switch it from SMS

652
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,880
interception and sproxis to interception

653
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,340
of the excess tokens to different

654
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,220
accounts it's also dangerous because

655
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,059
access to those phones if the data from

656
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:19,980
these phones will be processed the same

657
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,559
way as now ransomware groups processing

658
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,600
your victims knowing everything about

659
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,000
the victim before initiated initiating

660
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,340
attacks where is a good chance that

661
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,580
important people or like CEOs or

662
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,740
political persons will have compromised

663
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,440
phones so there is an opportunity for

664
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,659
targeted attacks

665
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:42,740
so here are some suggestions for

666
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,620
different focus groups

667
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:50,100
like customers smartphone vendors and

668
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,279
online platforms and you can find more

669
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,500
details on the report which was

670
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,440
published and we're preparing in our

671
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,600
research so we will continue this

672
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,059
research and publish more

673
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:05,460
about this so for now thank you very

674
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,640
much and if you have questions

675
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,440
we can

676
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,960
do this now or during the lunch

677
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:21,720
[Applause]

678
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,279
I think there is time for one question

679
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,380
yes Koto

680
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,659
code

681
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:29,940
I'm just wondering if you have any

682
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,000
recommendation to telecommunications

683
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,559
providers who have SMS

684
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:41,039
firewall capabilities is are there any

685
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,299
patterns

686
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:46,380
of SMS activity that could be detected

687
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,880
at a mobile network level on this this

688
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,659
type of incidence

689
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:57,860
so we had interaction with some isps

690
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,840
related to this case and I would say

691
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,100
isps were most comparable to investigate

692
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,219
those cases because we see both sides

693
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,918
like a telecom Telemetry internet

694
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:13,260
Telemetry and data

695
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,280
so uh I think there is opportunity to

696
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,579
trace here and given a small bunch of

697
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:24,300
indicators to Telecom we were able to

698
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,239
scale this let's say 10 20 times in the

699
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,159
terms of criminal infrastructure in the

700
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,079
terms of

701
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,579
affected models because Telecom sees

702
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:33,780
those models

703
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,399
so and the way we could act actually not

704
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,820
trace the sms's while address trace the

705
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,940
supply chains of particular models which

706
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,040
are mostly infected because if you see

707
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,659
let's say for Model A of vendor a where

708
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:55,020
like 20 infected devices in the country

709
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,560
out of 20 000 and for another vendor

710
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,359
where like 20

711
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:02,880
000 infected devices out of twenty one

712
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,900
thousand

713
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,060
so you can just statistically Trace

714
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,480
potential supply chain cases uh versus

715
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,720
the cases where users infected were

716
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,820
phones while downloaded applications

717
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,720
from alternative sources so I think it's

718
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,480
more about trades and Supply chains

719
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,619
which

720
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:24,720
telecom have bigger capabilities than

721
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,180
just tracing SMS so we could be even

722
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,099
better actions

723
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:32,579
and second second question uh are there

724
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:34,200
any

725
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,839
in the area any areas or markets in

726
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:40,140
Europe where this problem is

727
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,760
prevalent

728
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,380
so so I I would say uh on Amazon where

729
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,900
models of the phones which match the

730
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,240
brands and model versions which will say

731
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,800
pre-infections

732
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,900
with pre-infections

733
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,140
so I think response are in every country

734
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,660
actually

735
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,240
so in some cases you can see even famous

736
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,619
brands

737
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:07,140
while the reason for this is mostly not

738
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,260
photo order or

739
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:13,440
pre-infection with Rome while use third

740
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,359
parties is the keys which were

741
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,920
compromised

742
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,240
so even owning the well-known phone and

743
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,160
another reason for this for the cheap

744
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,859
series of the well-known brands

745
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:29,040
sometimes we use odm so we produce it on

746
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,859
the our factories and just label it uh

747
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:35,720
as a well-known brand

748
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,500
thank you very much don't forget to

749
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,079
evaluate the session now we have lunch

750
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:45,720
break until two o'clock uh it is

751
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,300
downstairs together with uh when their

752
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,900
Booth is Showcase so enjoy the break

753
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,640
talk to people that's why we are here

754
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,890
thank you Vladimir

755
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:59,540
[Applause]
