idaka

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,800
a friend works for inspecting dns

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,720
anomalies crossing on certain times

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,000
this is our last day first of all we are

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,920
going to make a brief introduction

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,480
about ourselves and introduce the code

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,119

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,480
who may not know

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,680
tw insert well secondly we work through

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,079
the

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,640
diversity and security threats which we

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,399
face in taiwan today

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,879
next let us dive into today's topic

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:45,920
directly

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,079
and he will talk about how we built our

24
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,039
framework

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,079
to discover uh the suspicious and

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:52,879
underneath

27
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,879
activities of adversaries by dns writers

28
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,120
lastly we are going to conclude our

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,520
works and provide some key takeaways for

30
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,680

67
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,840
after

68
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,599
after the incident sst is supervised

69
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,239
and conducted by the dcs which is the

70
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,879
department of cyber security

71
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,080
we sat perform subsecurity ready text

72
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,280
and missions we also uh cooperate with

73
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,319
other agencies

74
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,360

here is our commission we release early

77
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,560
warnings before

78
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,720
our evolving into a security incident

79
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,080
through long-term monitoring

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,879
and external information gathering we

81
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,840
execute

82
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,280

and technical inspection to increase the

84
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,879
preparation of sub-security protection

85
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,599
we assist in speedy recovery to normal

86
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,000
operation by providing technical support

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,760

internet stress

99
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,959
entrepreneur we also get the information

100
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,319
from the backbone gateway

101
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,480
of the government service network using

102
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,920
some

103
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,879
dpi mechanism and we actively detect

104
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,799
advanced persistent threats

105
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,560
at the level of government agencies

106
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,439
for comprehensive defense we promote

107
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,159
government configuration based on gcp

108
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,280
and specify a consistent security

109

112
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,519
via joint defense monitoring system

113
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,400
of subsequently we analyze the trend of

114
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,920
subsecuity

115
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,000
threats to achieve early warning and

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,320
strengthen our subsequent information

117
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,440

to increase the defense capabilities

131
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,840
against civil tax

132
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,680
we are responsible for maintaining

133
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,680
national cyber security incident

134
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,720
report and response platform we

135
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,040
assist government agencies in ci sectors

136
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,759
to

report and handle subsequent incidents

138
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,080
we also provide technical

139
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,400
services to government agencies to deal

140
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,199
with

141
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,080
cyber security incidents assist them to

142
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,880
process

143
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,280
emergency response procedures and

144
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,160
discover

145
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,680
root cause of different security

146
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,000
instruments to reinforce cyber security

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,120
defense

148
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,840
we do research and develop detection

149
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,440
rules of malware

150
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,240
and utilize them to discover compromised

151
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,840
governmental services in time

152
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,120
for information sharing we established

153
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,919
domestic

154
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,840
and international channels of cyber

155
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,520
security incident reporting

156
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,000
and joint defense collaboration we

157
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,960
rapidly quest

158
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,880
subsequently stress intelligence through

159
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,479
standardized formats

160
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,759
such as this and our automatic system

161
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,400
you can see like our national stock isec

162
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,120
and search

163
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,280
contract our national cyber security

164
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,840
joint debate system

165
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,319
next let's talk through let's work

166
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,759
through the um

167
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,840
diversity and security stress which we

168
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,720
face in taiwan

169
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,000
okay uh first we want to ask why dns

170
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,240
because this is critical to most network

171
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,360
operations

172
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,319
is generally not blocked under firewall

173
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:12,800
so

174
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,960
there are many attacks related to ds

175
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,039
protocol let's talk about the

176
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,639
first ddos is one of the most powerful

177
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,360
weapons

178
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,000
cyber criminals used to attack business

179
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,440
by fraudulent servers

180
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,759
with more internet traffic there are

181
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,080
many did us attacks by dns protocol

182
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,840
including amplification and water

183
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,880
charger

184
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,680
besides we all know a hacker may have

185
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,199
different possible

186
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,080
objectives they may aim to interrupt

187
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,720
business

188
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,199
corrupt data steal information or of

189
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,199
this simultaneously

190
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,680
this is one of the best channels for

191
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,360
criminals to highlight activities

192
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,639
whenever they try to

193
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,440
break into a network or with filtrate or

194
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,400
valuable

195
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,840
data from the organization many binaries

196
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,759
utilize phase thrust or

197
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,840
dji techniques to highlight infra

198
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,400
charges and increase the difficulties of

199
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,280
tracking them

200
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,360
from law enforcement and security

201
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,759
vendors on the other hand

202
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,400
tunneling is one of the most damaging

203
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,440
dance attacks

204
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,080
in our humble opinion this is this

205
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,880
technique

206
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,000
is difficult to detect because um

207
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,199
dns is a noisy protocol making making it

208
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,479
harder to distinguish

209
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,800
a normal host query and normally as

210
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,759
traffickers from

211
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,160
vicious activity in a situation we saw

212
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,960
any indicators or assumptions

213
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,520
let's work through the attacks or

214
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,240
techniques related to dns protocol

215
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,199
the first one is dns amplification a

216
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,680
popular form of tdos

217
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,319
attackers usually use publicly

218
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,039
accessible

219
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,599
open dns resolvers to fraud target

220
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,240
system

221
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,199
with dns response traffic the primary

222
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,080
technique

223
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,080
consists of an attacks controlling a

224
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,560
bondage to extend our domain

225
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,680
request to many open dns resolvers with

226
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,960
the source address

227
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,840
spoofed to be the target targets of the

228
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,639
address

229
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,199
with the dns resolvers send a dns record

230
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,319
response

231
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,160
is sent to the target instead

232
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,120
different frontiers amplification

233
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,919
against water torture many focused on

234
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,120
um italki dna server to pull over

235
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,360
against water torture attack

236
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,560
take her deliveries urbanite to make

237
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,280
thousands of dns requests for fake

238
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,240
subdomains

239
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,599
against an authorizative name server

240
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,880
the request of non-existent non-exist

241
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,080
subdomains or hosts will consume uh

242
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,080
memory and processing results on the

243
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,600
primary resolver

244
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,640
if we examine the dns request it should

245
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,120
reques

246
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,440
each request appeared to be a should

247
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,120
randomly generating string

248
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,839
of nonsense

249
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,760
fresh frost is a technique that involves

250
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,120
frequent and rapid changing of of the iv

251
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,880
addresses associated with a

252
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,560
f fully clarified domain name by using a

253
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,120
bonnet

254
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,399
acting as a reversing process there are

255
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,000
two types of phase flash service

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,800
networks

257
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,640
which are single frost and double frost

258
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,200
networks a single flash networks

259
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,440
usually are related to a single domain

260
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,320
name and combines the rollerbds response

261
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,240
with very short ttl

262
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,279
which is time to leave at values

263
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,480
and it's preparation of ttl our new ip

264
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,240
addresses replace the

265
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,040
the old ones for lowe's dns records in

266
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,920
the ds

267
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,600
zone file thousands of fast frost

268
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,160
um adrian's ip addresses are used in a

269
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,800
cyclic

270
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,560
order for dns aerator

271
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,080
double fresh frost or double frost is a

272
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,360
more sophisticated type of phase rust

273
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,640
level for us to represent rivers to

274
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,360
dynamically and repeat the transient iv

275
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,079
addresses

276
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,399
of both the dominant and its

277
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,079
authoritative name servers

278
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,240
with a very low dtr value as well

279
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,959
this provides an additional layer of

280
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,079
redundancy and

281
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,519
super survivability within the malware

282
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,839
network

283
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,640
domain generation algorithm also called

284
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,760
domain fox

285
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,600
is another technique used to

286
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,240
periodically generate many domain names

287
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,040
like provide

288
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,760
malware or bunny to beacon or

289
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,440
communicate their command control

290
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,320
service

291
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,519
many domain names for cnc servers make

292
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,640
it difficult for

293
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,959
law enforcement to shut down balance or

294
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,800
criminal infractions effectively

295
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,240
this tunneling is a technique like

296
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,360
encoded data

297
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,079
or other programs or protocols in dns

298
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,040
queries

299
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,160
including data panel including data

300
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,480
panels like can be added to an

301
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,360
attack dns server and used to control

302
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,480
remote server

303
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,040
applications this dns is rarely

304
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,760
monitored

305
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,399
and analyzed so attackers can use

306
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,279
tunneling

307
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,360
in order to remote access compromised

308
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,600
computers without trigger any

309
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,560
security event it's very hard to

310
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,680
differentiate

311
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,480
on the denial and malicious usage of dns

312
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,200
protocol

313
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,600
for the traditional firewall or i guess

314
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,079
and you can find lots of dns tunnels

315
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,360
tours on right easily

316
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,440
including freeware and commercial ones

317
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,720
such as ds cad2 ds20cp

318
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,079
and others metasploit and proper strike

319
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,079
here we want to mention copper strike

320
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,360
particularly

321
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,880
since to 2019 the

the compiled source code of the cobra

323
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,800
strike had been linked online

324
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,279
and fought more than hundreds or

325
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,000
thousands

326
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,800
of times we observed and detected more

327
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
and more intrusion incidents related to

328
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,720

by branding it in with existing traffic

348
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,519
here are some adversary groups which use

349
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,519
these tunneling techniques in their

350

352
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,120
targeting their governments and

353
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,560
in industries in taiwan

354
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,800
okay next uh let's talk about uh how we

355
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,600
build our framework to discard the

356
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,480
underneath activities for the results by

357
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,360
dns records

358
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,040
okay let us

359
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,040
take a quick view with the overview of

360
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,240
our id a

361
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,680
card framework first we will talk about

362
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,800
the challenge

363
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,880
the data and exchange in taiwan

364
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,920
government service network

365
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,120
is the complex network average

366
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,040
the same as many tier one label

367
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,839
they were does the complex network

368
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,600
approach is due to the

369
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,079
agency have their own domain zones and

370
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,040
the necessary open dns resolvers

371
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,320
and also the agency may have their own

372
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,600
nit

373
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,880
so the ds queries could be ambiguous in

374
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,160
the noisy

375
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,560
when an intruder is trying to abuse an

376
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,360
open

377
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,160
resolvers with when there are also many

378
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,040
normal behaviors it is necessary to

379
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,680
build

380
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,399
a scalable analyzing system with good

381
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,760
performance

382
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,279
for digesting daily dignity locks

383
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,760
as we know the average amount of the

384
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,959
daily dns logs is more than 100 million

385
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,639
breakers so the system needs to

386
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,839
increase the load in real time

387
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,839
fortunately in order to provide

388
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,959
analytical capabilities

389
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,079
we had established

390
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,880
along the architecture first we

391
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,160
leveraged

392
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,360
the modern eok model and

393
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,000
we used the log stage for the lock

394
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,040
collection

395
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,120
and the kafka is the buffer

396
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,399
the partition topic is used

397
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,440
for the parallelized processing

398
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,760
all the pre-analysis requirement and the

399
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,360
data interesting

400
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,920
will be done through the spark which is

401
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,959
the in-memory computing

402
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,240
system and after that

403
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,839
all the injuries data are to

404
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,959
alakazantra which is the

405
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,000
scalable distributed data source

406
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,600
once has used with the facebook company

407
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,720
with the london architecture we land

408
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,920
in pro and ensemble framework to satisfy

409
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,959
our analysis process the first one is

410
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:35,759
the

411
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,959
feature instruction which is based on

412
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,440
the dns

413
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,800
hp we want to extract the extract

414
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,920
features will be provided to the two

415
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,040
modules

416
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,800
the first is the domain attribute

417
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,440
encoder and the second is the subdomain

418
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,560
encoder

419
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,839
those two modules will will help us to

420
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:58,800
do the

421
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,320
further analysis okay let's go through

422
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,199
the part one

423
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,000
abnormal subdomain detection the power

424
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,880
one will

425
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,519
be the abnormal subdomain detection as

426
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,600
we mentioned earlier the major feature

427
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,839
to identify the dj domain is the

428
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,639
prosciutto random domain

429
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,800
so in order to detect the dji

430
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,079
based subdomain will leverage the long

431
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,120
short-term memory

432
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,320
neural network model to identify it

433
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,720
the detection method is proposed by the

434
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,079
in-game company

435
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,199
the subdomain is transferred to the

436
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,079
character

437
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,279
table in order to train the

438
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,560
model the elixir top 100 million are

439
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,199
used

440
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,639
as the benign domain and the malicious

441
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,519
domain

442
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,680
ager founder non-malware family

443
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,199
as we see the stm model

444
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,040
classified almost 90 percent

445
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,320
of the dji domains with very low voice

446
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,600
positive

447
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,799
so it looks well right but

448
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,640
according to our observation dns queries

449
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,160
from security vendors

450
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,679
may just act as less individual way

451
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,599
we can see that djs detection methods

452
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,160
are somehow limited many security

453
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,760
companies

454
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,039
also behave like dja as an example

455
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,960
such as the trend micro number three

456
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,760
they just look like the dj queries by

457
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,480
the way

458
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,799
the ds tunnel also looks like the dg

459
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,520
away

460
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,000
as the last one you can see so

461
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,320
as a result we can see from the

462
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,240
following three pictures

463
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,000
the middle and the right figures use the

464
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,880
k-means and the gaussian mixture model

465
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,840
for the

466
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,880
crosstalking respectively

467
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,240
however the actual data distribution

468
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,360
is just like little far left

469
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,080
so it will cause difficulties in the

470
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,879
data grouping

471
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,559
in order to implement in order to

472
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,840
improve the real world data flow we have

473
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,240
made

474
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,240
foreign improvements first we will adapt

475
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,520
real world data to reveal similar dji

476
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,280
like dns queries from av vendors

477
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,960
and the second we fill out the

478
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,480
corresponding domain name

479
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,200
through the fqt and the high portion of

480
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,679
the antivirus mender

481
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,520
to feedback the white list to assist us

482
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,120
in the data reduction so

483
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,120
so far the white list

484
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,880
will contribute a huge progress

485
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,880
with this model okay

486
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,200
now we will control part two the patch

487
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,320
will be the domain name reputation

488
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,280
as we mentioned earlier the major

489
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,520
feature to identify the dji domain is

490
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,280
the prosciutto random domain

491
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,720
the second part we will discuss

492
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,240
why we use the domain name reputation

493
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,039
in real world inspect with every korean

494
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:23,840
is not

495
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,280
efficiency for example the dns query

496
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,480
behaviors

497
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,160
generated by the security vendors such

498
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,440
as the

499
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,200
table shows account for very large

500
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,600
portion of the dns traffic

501
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,640
so we need a reputation mechanism for

502
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,360
domain name

503
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,840
and then let us recap the dns tunnel

504
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,080
behavior

505
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,559
many malicious software use the dns

506
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,160
tunnel to steal data

507
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,799
and establish commit and control

508
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,720
communication channels

509
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,919
by abusing their mercantile

510
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,559
the main focus is to register the domain

511
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,360
name

512
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,720
and the hosting of the relative dns

513
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,840
server

514
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,600
which is used for the recursive query

515
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,200
to report users registration behavior

516
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,799
which is so called as the dns beacon

517
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,320
by only specific domain zone

518
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,960
collecting all the non-exist domain

519
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,840
belongs to it

520
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,400
and all the message is encrypted and

521
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,039
encode is a part of subdomain

522
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,000
therefore this is the biggest challenge

523
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,200
to detect

524
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,679
this domain zone registered by the ds

525
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,840
tunnel

526
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,240
okay so take the dns behavior of the

527
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,480
copper strike as the example

528
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,720
copper strike is the most common hacking

529
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
tool in recent years

530
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,840
to understand the

531
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,159
character of dn's tunnel behavior

532
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,200
during the copper strike tour works

533
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,840
the first it will generate a large

534
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,760
number of these queries

535
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,480
to ensure reliability the include

536
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,679
message

537
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,760
inside the dns query could be sent

538
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,360
multiple times

539
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,559
so in also in the beacon mode the

540
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,120
serious

541
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,720
return responds anything so

542
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,280
it will generate large number of

543
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,159
non-exist

544
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,440
domain responses so

545
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,640
there are many detection methods

546
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,799
many use this feature to detect this

547
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,320
behavior

548
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,520
and the didn't

549
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
as tolerant change operation more

550
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,280
according to the

551
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,480
response as you can see in the

552
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,520
table shows that only

553
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,280
with the few kinds of ds response

554
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,520
in the also in the dns idol status

555
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,559
also when you switch into the

556
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,600
command and control mode it will use i'm

557
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,280
using the tt crew

558
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,280
these queries when client gets specific

559
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,159
responses so we can see

560
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,960
as the table shows only a few different

561
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,080
responses

562
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,200
type and characteristics of domain name

563
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,640
length

564
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,440
is the feature we observed

565
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,400
based on the observation of the dns

566
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,440
behavior

567
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,880
of these tools we expected to extract

568
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,039
these features as below

569
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,240
the first is the query count curriculum

570
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,640
means

571
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,840
the total number of the dns queries

572
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,039
second the share count

573
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,320
in the shortcut we calculate the length

574
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,159
between each domain name

575
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,000
as its shape for example the abc

576
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,600
the example.com street is the

577
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,520
third example.com maybe

578
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,880
the cdefg.exemple.com will trade

579
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,559
as to the fight the example account

580
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,760
so the total ship count of the resembled

581
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,320
account

582
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,400
will be two okay the third

583
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,720
the current time local income means how

584
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,720
many clients have required

585
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,480
domain for each domain zone and first is

586
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,880
the server complex means

587
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,520
how many servers has been used to query

588
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,400
domains

589
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,440
for each domain zone the last

590
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,240
is the answer com the answer can means

591
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,960
how many

592
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,760
answers have been responded for each

593
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,480
domain zone

594
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,520
and here is the ds feature

595
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,360
observation as you can see

596
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,240
including the ds tunnel dns amplifier

597
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,279
ddos

598
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,159
water torture details and the normal

599
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,279
stuff such as the

600
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,960
cdn and the security vendor service

601
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,360
and the last is the scan dn scanning

602
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,320
service

603
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,440
the number as we can see the normal

604
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,279
service cdn service

605
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,880
has the balance number of the users

606
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,520
of their service and the number of the

607
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,039
queries has grown

608
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,200
correspond correspondingly

609
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,919
so let's let's the important future as

610
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,559
we can see

611
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,960
so with the feature we extract from

612
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,640
earlier model we leverage the

613
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,360
machine learning model such as the svn

614
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,880
and the random force

615
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,480
classifier for tunnel domain

616
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,279
classification

617
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,640
there are total 2042 domains

618
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,159
gathered for the experiment the first

619
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,279
experiment is the benefication

620
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,520
with the bin line and the abnormal

621
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,200
domain

622
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,960
as you can see the table shows the

623
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,640
accuracy of the

624
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,919
random forest classifier is

625
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:18,000
98.6 percent

626
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,840
and the sva model is the 96.2

627
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,679
so it looks very well right

628
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,799
and in the second experiment the target

629
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,279
data

630
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,400
are extend to tunnel syrian

631
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,039
and benign domain foreign multi-level

632
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,640
classification

633
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,840
as a result the random forest model

634
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,120
stills

635
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,320
gets the 97

636
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,520
the six percent and it is also better

637
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,000
than the

638
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,679
svm model does according to the above

639
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,120
two experiment

640
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,159
results we can see that the

641
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,520
extracted features are very efficient

642
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,159
effective in helping us for the

643
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,679
classified

644
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,559
occasion of those behaviors

645
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,080
okay in the third part we will use the

646
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,799
previous

647
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,400
extract domain features to develop

648
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,600
a model for detecting anomaly in time

649
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,640
series

650
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,919
let is the outlier detection we will

651
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,320
profile the domain zone behaviors

652
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,679
to stick for the outlier such as the dns

653
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,840
tunnel

654
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,840
to detect abnormal cross uncertain times

655
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,919
we want to introduce the outlay

656
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:40,880
detection

657
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,760
in time series outlier detection is

658
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,720
widely used

659
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,679
in the industry and the medical area

660
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,200
including the defect

661
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,120
detection even some medical equipment is

662
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,039
used to detect the

663
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,559
irregular harvest signal such the apple

664
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,960
watch we use

665
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,159
we hoped to use the same domain feature

666
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,000
to apply the detection method

667
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,279
with the lstm anomaly detection

668
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,640
as the paper shows and also

669
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,080
the deep end that's a

670
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,720
deep learning approach for unsupervised

671
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,880
number detection intensive

672
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,080
is also doing that

673
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,360
so first we create a domain detection

674
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,720
indicator

675
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,360
and use the long shorter memory model

676
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,240
to memorize the normal behavior of this

677
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,679
indicator

678
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,039
so like the normal heart bits

679
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,080
it will be you will have relative

680
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,120
regularity the outliers such as the

681
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,960
abnormal raising signal

682
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,559
is used to detect malicious behavior

683
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,799
to adapt the data into the outlier

684
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,080
detection method

685
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,760
first we developed a domain indicator

686
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,640
the features of the domain controller

687
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,840
and the client come

688
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,640
and answer come from the previous

689
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,600
classification

690
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,720
is also used here to construct the

691
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,919
indicator now with the indic

692
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,440
with the dns behavior indicator

693
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,799
the dns behavior

694
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,080
are transformed into the signal problem

695
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,439
within the time series

696
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,279
okay and to detect the

697
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,159
dns tunnel behavior we then use the

698
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,640
outlet detection as means to detect

699
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,399
it first we leverage the

700
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,799
long short-term memory auto encoder

701
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,679
technology to encode each domain

702
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,480
then we reconstruct the indicator in the

703
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,080
time window

704
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,640
such as three days five days and seven

705
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,360
days

706
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,640
or one or two hour maybe maybe we can

707
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,679
exceed the

708
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,039
two minutes after all and then

709
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,640
using the risk construction error rate

710
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,679
with the auto encoder to determine which

711
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,440
is the abnormal

712
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,760
the normal domain name behavior will be

713
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,880
regular with low

714
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,919
risk concussion raw red and

715
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,320
abnormal such as the racing ecg signal

716
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,039
will cause the high coding error rate

717
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,320
due to the

718
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,440
deviation so change detection for the

719
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,520
active domain such

720
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,159
as the abnormal ecg will be used as the

721
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,640
detection of the active tunnel domain

722
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,440
in the experiment for outright detection

723
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,799
with text days

724
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,120
is the time window for detecting

725
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,480
abnormal

726
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,080
behavior during the test

727
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,159
a total of the 3453 domains

728
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,279
names were used within the 171 days

729
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,600
period in a lstm outlier model

730
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,039
we use the imse

731
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,360
which is the root mean square arrow to

732
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,279
choose the threshold

733
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,559
for us here we can see

734
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,520
the average domain name reconstruction

735
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,399
error

736
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,959
is much more or less than

737
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,760
than one while the abnormal value is

738
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,760
just 100 times

739
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,679
than the normal value a total of five

740
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,840
sets of the actual malaysia's tunnel

741
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,720
domains

742
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,559
were detected in these three months

743
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,000
by our model

744
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,840
so final is the conclusion in the

745
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,640
tech ways in order to provide the

746
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,080
capacity

747
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,600
to process dns behavior in a tier 1

748
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,559
network

749
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,840
we first establish a long-term

750
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,720
data processing platform as the basis

751
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,600
and to inspect the economic closing

752
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,279
answer long time

753
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,880
in addition we had build an ensemble

754
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,000
framework

755
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,080
that can share the same behavior

756
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,120
characteristic

757
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,120
for multi-purpose first we used to

758
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,000
detect malicious behavior related to

759
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,960
prosciutto

760
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,080
pursue the random domain here we also

761
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,720
use the

762
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,519
machine learning methods such as svn and

763
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,080
the random

764
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:37,039
force to clarify the dns behaviors

765
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,080
the second part to detect

766
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,200
abnormal indicator in time series

767
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
we leveraged the previous feature

768
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,679
anomaly detection indicator

769
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,039
techniques such as stm auto encoder

770
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,159
are then used to memorize the normal and

771
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,279
to identify for the outlier behavior

772
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,559
which is the dns tunnel behaviors

773
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,000
this general method helped us to find

774
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,200
anomaly in uncertain time that's what we

775
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,159
are talking about today thanks for your

776
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,760
listening

777
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,159
finally here are the key takeaways for

778
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,760
everyone

779
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,480
every organization should develop or

780
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,559
implement a formalized product

781
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,600
or system to monitor the dns trafficker

782
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,120
to ensure their service

783
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,640
is used as intended audience looks for

784
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,679
writers

785
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,640
to verify like each type of query is

786
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,919
resolving to

787
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,120
intended location and topics user dns

788
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,440
firewall or security products to block

789
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,519
malicious domain names are provided by

790
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,679
screen vendors or communities

791
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,840
provide security awareness training to

792
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,000
police it's very important

793
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,200
such as domain name cloaking dns

794
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,440
hijacking phishing and social

795
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,200
engineering attacks

796
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,240
and the last but not least takeaway

797
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,120
is the contact information of tw insert

798
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,399
we look for

799
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,720
our collaboration in many ways and we

800
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,480
can handle most of the subsequent

801
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,000
incidents in taiwan

802
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,320
sharing and collaboration is the key to

803
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,000
defending subsequently

804
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,320
thank you for your time and attention

805
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,279
goodbye
