environment

5
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,879

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,719
connects these dots

7
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,199

different types of cyber exercises on a

91
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,480
national level and

92
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,640
also on an international level so today

93
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,839

ncsc's contribution to the theater 20

95
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,919
public private partnership um exercise

96
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,840
and how what were the key lessons

97
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,280
learned from our side

98
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,440

oh thank you and what i forgot to

101
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,120
mention is that

102
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,759
i'm essentially was i was also a project

103
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,400
manager

104
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,759
for this exercise so therefore i'm

105
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,240
more telling you about the arrangements

106
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,759
how we did it

107
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,120
uh well how how did the other exercise

108
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,680
improve the

109
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,199
public private partnership here in

110
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,800
finland uh we'll

111
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,160
firstly give you some background

112
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,919
information to kind of

113
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,240
highlight on what were the participants

114
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,919
for example in the exercise

115
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,199
and that way we can more clearly

116
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,360
point out the facts how we did it

117
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,840
well the theater exercises i have a long

118
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,560
background

119
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,280
for over 22 years already and and still

120
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,160
counting and

121
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,479
essentially it's a continuation that

122
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,680
builds on top of

123
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,199
the previous exercise every time over

124
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,840
basically the exercise is a scenario

125
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,320
best

126
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,720
table dog exercise but it always has

127
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,240
included a real life

128
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,919
role action real life

129
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,199
role action playing game in the end of

130
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,199
the exercise

131
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,600
and this is essentially that that is a

132
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,880
valuable example

133
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,039
of the successful part private

134
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,400
partnership through the

135
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,639
participants that are in involved in the

136
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,479
exercise government officials

137
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,880
companies uh all mixed together working

138
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,440
working for a cyber crisis

139
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,080
uh in order to solve it and in order to

140
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
recover from it

141
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,919
uh essentially the exercise is a

142
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,199
platform for developing and testing

143
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,160
existing methods and and existing uh

144
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,880
plans

145
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,960
on how to recover from from such an

146
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,199
incident

147
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,080
and what makes the exercise quite

148
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,759
effective is the fact that it's been

149
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,800
organized together with

150
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,039
finnish broadcasting company which is

151
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,000
creating real

152
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,199
life news feeds into the exercise

153
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,680
of but based on the imaginary news

154
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,199
content that we have developed

155
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,280
overall the high-level goals for this

156
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,400
exercise is to create precursors for the

157
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,440
cooperation that exists in these vast

158
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,520
networks of companies and government

159
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,800
officials and especially of course on

160
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
cyber incidents as mentioned

161
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,960
and we are aiming to develop the

162
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,360
situational awareness in companies

163
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,880
but to build them capabilities and

164
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,319
provide them information

165
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,280
to enable better decision making in vast

166
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,759
cyber incidents

167
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,520
and uh one essential part is also to

168
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,039
induct them into the existing

169
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,520
cooperation forums and structures which

170
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:11,919
are

171
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,639
in finland nowadays and can support and

172
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,160
survive the cyber crisis

173
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,840
and of course we are trying to produce

174
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,680
results that we can measure

175
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,160
or follow up afterwards and see that

176
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,919
they are developing and then

177
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,840
that the cooperation is being developed

178
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,319
further

179
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,440
and uh one essential point is that

180
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,199
the cyber development programs in

181
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,800
finland gain their

182
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,520
topics from these kinds of exercises so

183
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,000
whatever we find in the exercise will be

184
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,160
uh developed further in in those

185
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,120
programs

186
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,599
and for example the nist directive has

187
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,840
been implemented in finland so that uh

188
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,639
we can

189
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,000
exercise it for example in the theater

190
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,599
20 exercise that we

191
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,479
had last year so it's something we

192
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,479
believe that is unique in the european

193
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,800
level

194
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,800
and what does an organization gain by

195
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,639
participating in the exercise

196
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,199
for first of all everything we do in the

197
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:15,840
exercise

198
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,080
aims to the fact that we hope that the

199
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,199
participants can

200
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,840
update their plans uh or even their

201
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,919
agreements based on the exercise or

202
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:24,560
whatever

203
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,680
findings they have there

204
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,680
we hope that they will start organizing

205
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,240
their own cyber exercises in their own

206
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,440
organization

207
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,279
and we hope that we can provide the

208
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,880
information that

209
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,919
makes that give somebody an ally to

210
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,880
invest in the

211
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,480
in the uh in the cyber

212
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,839
cyber security well usually the cyber

213
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,680
security is something that has been seen

214
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,000
as

215
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,360
cost and uh the direct

216
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,800
kind of feedback from the

217
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,920
investments is not that obvious so uh

218
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,600
hopefully we can give writing an alley

219
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,839
on how to recover from the incidents

220
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,040
by saving and that usually means

221
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,880
saving money in the process as well

222
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,399
and yes the theater 20 exercise was more

223
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,760
than just an exercise

224
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,120
it's more about the cooperation of the

225
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,240
networks and companies

226
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,560
uh the theater exercises have been

227
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,560
arranged every other year and uh

228
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,640
usually the focus changes from year to

229
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,560
year in these exercises

230
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,480
and this time around we focused on the

231
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,760
food production

232
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,880
resale and delivery and logistics

233
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,440
related to those fields of industry we

234
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:41,920
had

235
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,839
oil essentially there because it's

236
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,080
needed in the logistics and water

237
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,680
because that is needed in the food

238
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,720
production

239
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,640
and then we had the sector-specific

240
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,240
officials involved

241
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,959
from those fields of industry such as

242
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:55,360
the

243
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,399
needs reporting related officials

244
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,640
we also had the partner companies or the

245
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,800
service providing companies that provide

246
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,079
services to the

247
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,079
first dimension sectors such as the

248
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,600
telecom ict and

249
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,839
security physical security protection

250
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,360
providing companies

251
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,600
and the network and cooperation of all

252
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,399
of these

253
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,040
in one cyber crisis and of course then

254
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,839
we had

255
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,880
officials such as julia

256
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,320
right exactly so what we wanted to do

257
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,079
is would create kind of a mini

258
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,839
simulation of a society

259
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,640
and by doing that effectively we also

260
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,320
had to have the information security

261
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,200
officials

262
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,839
incorporated in the exercise so that's

263
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,279
the reason why we had

264
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,640
our center ncsc as well as

265
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,519
members from the police force and other

266
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,000
defense forces and such

267
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,399
come together to organize this exercise

268
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,040
so they were

269
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,200
both exercising there helping the other

270
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,120
participants and also we were part of

271
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,920
the

272
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,640
planning process so definitely a very

273
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,839
comprehensive

274
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,519
participation

275
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,920
yeah then of course we had the bad guys

276
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,200
there the red team

277
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,640
that was taking the game further and and

278
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,440
kind of directing the game through the

279
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,959
pre-scheduled uh

280
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,240
scenarios from from the background work

281
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,079
that we've done and then we had the

282
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,040
white team which simulated the otherwise

283
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,880
missing society of the

284
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,240
exercise the miniature society that we

285
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,200
had here

286
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,839
included almost all the needed parts

287
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:30,560
there but

288
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,160
in case something was missing such as

289
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,680
the president of finland it was

290
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,800
simulated by the white team which was

291
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,800
really interesting to see happened

292
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,519
about the profiles that participated

293
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,320
from those

294
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,560
companies we had lots and lots of

295
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,800
different organizations participating in

296
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,360
the

297
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,480
in the exercise from uh 10 fields of

298
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,839
industry

299
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,880
and what's what was kind of uh the most

300
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,200
important topic here is that it's it

301
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,600
really wasn't a huge investment for the

302
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,000
participants to join the exercise

303
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,959
uh we calculated that it was roughly

304
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,519
around 10 000 working hours that was

305
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,000
spent in participating in the exercise

306
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,680
and that really is an investment

307
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,639
from the participants and uh we hope

308
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,360
that they

309
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,839
feel that they gain something really by

310
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,720
participating

311
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,480
since they made such an investment in it

312
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,399
okay and then uh to give you an example

313
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,240
of the contents of the

314
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,480
exercise the the schedule we had to of

315
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,160
course adjust that uh

316
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,800
due to the covet 19 crisis uh many times

317
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,760
over and

318
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,000
this is kind of the final format of the

319
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,839
of the schedule

320
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,480
anyway the most important notion here is

321
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,040
that

322
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,519
we had a couple of educational modules

323
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,399
there that

324
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,920
were providing information to the

325
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,480
participants and educating them

326
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,680
on various topics and then we topped it

327
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,320
up with the

328
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,880
with the intensive face camp or the game

329
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,920
that we were playing

330
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,519
this january this year

331
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,600
and overall we will have still a

332
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,360
follow-up seminar upcoming

333
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,800
later this this autumn to follow up on

334
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,320
the subjects that were found

335
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,160
during the exercise

336
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,200
and the content that we were educating

337
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,600
the participants were about the hybrid

338
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,800
influencing

339
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,120
uh and about the crisis communications

340
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,079
that is happening

341
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,920
during the the cyber crisis uh or large

342
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,399
or

343
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,720
something somewhat instantaneously

344
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,440
happening uh cyber incidents

345
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,639
uh and one of the most important

346
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,880
topics of the first day was the critical

347
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,360
business process prioritization and

348
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,880
system level prioritization that was

349
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,639
educated to the participants and

350
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,399
hopefully they will start doing that in

351
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,040
their

352
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,240
organizations as well

353
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,680
the second phase during during

354
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,800
september was about the legislation

355
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,880
which is to be considered in these kinds

356
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,920
of cri

357
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,880
cyber incidents uh and then the

358
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,399
government officials were

359
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,560
dealing out their their expectations

360
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,240
towards companies and

361
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,760
otherwise basically support and services

362
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,199
that they are providing companies

363
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,560
to survive these cyber incidents

364
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,480
for example the police was dealing out

365
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,800
information on how to report cyber crime

366
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,240
and

367
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,680
so on and of course the ncsc

368
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,880
was uh educating companies on on their

369
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,279
services and the support that they are

370
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:39,920
providing

371
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,279
for the companies to survive this crisis

372
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,519
uh we were sharing information on the uh

373
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,360
isaac's information sharing

374
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,079
and competency centers uh that are

375
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,680
existing currently in finland

376
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,760
and then of course information related

377
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,040
to the nice

378
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,680
reporting which is coming from the eu

379
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,959
side

380
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,279
and then the most important topic was

381
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,240
the model for

382
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,839
major incident management and

383
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,600
cooperation for these

384
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,160
robust and large-scale cyber incidents

385
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,560
we had an additional information uh

386
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,279
sharing

387
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,360
session before the game phase of the

388
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,720
exercise and the

389
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,720
the educational content there was the

390
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,000
pointing out of the roles and

391
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,680
responsibilities of the crisis

392
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,880
management team

393
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,880
uh in a company and basically the

394
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,199
participants were

395
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,320
adapting them into those roles

396
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,839
and then of course we went through the

397
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,160
existing reporting methods

398
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,440
such as real life forms to report crime

399
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,720
or gdpr

400
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,480
or information security breaches to ncsc

401
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,560
and the nice reporting that is this

402
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,480
happening

403
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,199
and perhaps any interesting topic is the

404
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:51,920
fact that we

405
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,880
shared also the imaginary news content

406
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,040
all you know in all of these phases

407
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,120
through the broadcasts of the finnish

408
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,639
broadcasting company

409
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,120
and that kind of got the players into

410
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,839
the mood

411
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,880
of the exercise

412
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,600
and that that takes us into the game and

413
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,040
the scenarios that we

414
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,399
were playing there uh firstly the game

415
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,000
is a non-technical game

416
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,240
uh which we were playing there so it's

417
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,600
an information sharing

418
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,079
exercise of overall

419
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,480
we were kind of dealing out different

420
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,560
kinds of injects that were coming from

421
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,639
the scenarios of the background story

422
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,079
that was created for the

423
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,800
exercise uh and it was done to the

424
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,399
partisan participants

425
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,680
via emails phones tv news social media

426
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,600
or internet simulators

427
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,720
and and software such as those and that

428
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,160
basically means that we can

429
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,120
do this exercise remotely nowadays it

430
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,079
was a hybrid

431
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,000
this time around and most of the

432
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,160
participants were participating

433
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,320
remotely into the game phase of the

434
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,880
exercise

435
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,240
the communication of the effects

436
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,640
in this robust network was the most

437
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,679
important topic and

438
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,679
exercising that for example using the uh

439
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,919
isaac information sharing groups

440
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,760
throughout the game was an important

441
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,359
point there and overall the participants

442
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,720
had to rehearse giving interviews or

443
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,919
giving press conferences uh publicly and

444
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,559
sharing information through that way as

445
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,160
well

446
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,240
the scenarios that we were playing there

447
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,160
were basically four high-level

448
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,120
scenarios including uh many actors such

449
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,000
as terrorist

450
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,880
actors and uh even a couple of countries

451
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,919
making their

452
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,799
own agendas uh happening in the internet

453
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,000
realm and

454
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
affecting that way that participants and

455
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,039
the game that was

456
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,080
being played really live a two-sided

457
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,760
role-playing game

458
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,400
that we used

459
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,200
so then it was time to play

460
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,160
uh the game in the module 3 that we were

461
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,880
playing this january uh was

462
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,520
as mentioned three-day game uh starting

463
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:07,919
from

464
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,080
from the morning and ending uh at

465
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
evening a long day for

466
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,559
every participants we have to have to of

467
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,400
course start the week by

468
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,559
making preparations and making the first

469
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,400
injects into the game

470
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,760
so that they were healthy ready made

471
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,480
although we then left some room from

472
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,160
improvisation and and

473
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,960
allowing the game to live its own life

474
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,240
uh throughout the

475
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,160
days uh the important topic here was to

476
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,840
share the information throughout the

477
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,280
days between the

478
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,440
different teams in the game and that was

479
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,559
done by doing the

480
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,559
uh summaries of the day it's an

481
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,000
important uh

482
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,080
point to share out uh level out the

483
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,200
information

484
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,640
uh between the participants all over in

485
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,360
the game

486
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,880
but even more important

487
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,840
method for doing that was the isaac

488
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,360
group operational meetings

489
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,440
that were held regularly within the days

490
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,080
were that was the most important and

491
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,480
most

492
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,640
effective way of sharing information

493
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,960
related to cyber prices and and

494
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,120
dealing out the information which helps

495
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,080
the companies

496
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,600
in recovering from those incidents

497
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,880
and of course we we had a hot worship in

498
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,480
the end of the game and and

499
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,520
discuss the findings that we did

500
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,559
with the exercise

501
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,080
and of course the ule was also involved

502
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,039
throughout the days

503
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,080
it was uh keeping their own

504
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,240
exercise at the same time with our

505
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,520
exercise and they were

506
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,000
also participating in the game and they

507
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,200
even

508
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,840
made some in addition to making the news

509
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,559
content

510
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,440
they were making ip based uh

511
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,919
broadcasting technology for the exercise

512
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,000
and they will be using that in the real

513
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,760
life price situations

514
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,200
after the exercise as well so it was

515
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,520
really an important

516
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,960
exercise for them as well for over

517
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,200
50 persons were joining from the finnish

518
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,159
broadcasting company

519
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,400
well how will we follow up these topics

520
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,799
we of course had a hot workshop seminar

521
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,760
right after the

522
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,159
intensive phase uh basically the

523
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,200
companies were

524
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,440
dealing out the information that uh or

525
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,520
sharing the information that they found

526
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,799
uh in the exercise and uh they

527
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,120
basically gave promises on the topics

528
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
that they will be developing in their

529
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,240
own organizations and then we will still

530
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,559
be having a follow-up seminar later this

531
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,280
autumn

532
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,600
uh where we can follow up on what

533
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,559
what things they've been able to take

534
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,120
further

535
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,520
and whether there were any possible

536
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,640
impediments

537
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,320
uh in those topics and of course we will

538
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,280
hear those

539
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,799
presentations from the government

540
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,400
officials as well and

541
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,600
uh how they will be supporting these uh

542
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,360
these topics

543
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,960
and then we will have the islands

544
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,360
activities within the whole network that

545
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,679
is unique here in finland and we will of

546
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,480
course take the

547
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,520
topics further through those those

548
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,559
networks as well

549
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,840
so uh how was the ncsc's

550
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,640
participation in the theater 20 exercise

551
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,320
julia

552
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,159
right thanks so we wanted to take a very

553
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,280
comprehensive

554
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,280
approach to this exercise and it's

555
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,440
planning and all faces because

556
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,679
it is a very important exercise not only

557
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,280
on a national level but also for

558
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,720
the ncsc to both perform well

559
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,440
as an organization as well as help other

560
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,120
organizations play

561
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,840
and test their processes as best what

562
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,720
they can

563
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,799
so we have this kind of plan do check

564
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,280
act type of way that i will pre

565
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,480
present what we did to you guys so plan

566
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,159
to succeed first of all

567
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,000
like i said we wanted to have a very

568
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
comprehensive um

569
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,240
approach to this so we were involved in

570
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,799
the entire life cycle of theater 20 so

571
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,480
the exercise we

572
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,960
had a member or members in the planning

573
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,880
team coordination team

574
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,360
blue team red team white team so we were

575
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,640
all over the

576
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,480
exercise scenario of writings and and

577
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,679
activities

578
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,880
and of course we had our own

579
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,880
post-exercise evaluation so we could

580
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,280
gather all the good insight that we got

581
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,400
and then develop that further some of

582
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,120
the best practices that we had

583
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,520
in terms of this comprehensive approach

584
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,400
were that we

585
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,880
by by doing this we were able to

586
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,919
influence

587
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,480
the tools and devices used in the ttx

588
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,159
and that was a very good insight

589
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,080
so even though they weren't the ones

590
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,840
that we use in our day-to-day life

591
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,480
they were there were possibilities to

592
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,600
make them

593
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,640
appear closer to those that we do use

594
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,360
another best practice was that we were

595
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,120
able to influence the scenario and

596
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,200
injects like anthi said there were

597
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,720
many different scenarios types of

598
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,240
scenarios and injects

599
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,440
so by being present and having our say

600
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,000
in it

601
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,120
we were able to kind of um create a more

602
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,440
realistic world view as well as

603
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,280
um as well as have our say

604
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,640
in in how we would want to exercise

605
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,720
ourselves and then the third best

606
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,480
practice was definitely a two-way

607
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,000
communication channel

608
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,640
of wants and needs between digipool and

609
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,919
ncsc

610
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,400
so we thought it was very valuable for

611
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,120
us to keep

612
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,799
direct communications throughout the

613
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,120
life cycle if you could put the next

614
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,840
slide please

615
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,440
thank you so on the do face like anthony

616
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,120
mentioned a few times they were

617
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,840
these ice sacks that we um used and that

618
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,240
we

619
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,320
currently use in real life as well so

620
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,120
information sharing and analysis centers

621
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,760
so this was an integral part of theater

622
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,960
20's goal

623
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
of enhancing this type of network

624
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,880
cooperation and the public-private

625
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,320
partnerships that we

626
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,559
essentially wanted to practice in the

627
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,360
exercise

628
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,520
so we had different ice sacks for food

629
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,679
stuff logistics water

630
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,640
media and so on and our blue team had

631
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,640
very specifically predefined

632
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,720
roles for each player so whether they

633
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,000
were

634
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,559
so not solely but mainly responsible for

635
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,760
incident response

636
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,679
or whether they were mainly responsible

637
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,240
for isaac coordination responsible

638
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,880
responsibility so in that sense it was

639
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,919
um

640
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,279
it was um emulated the reality in a

641
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,120
really nice way and we were able to get

642
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,440
some good insight into how those isaacs

643
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,039
worked during the exercise and what

644
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,039
could be improved

645
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,480
next slide please and then the other

646
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,880
part of our play or our

647
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,960
simulation was the incident handling so

648
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,640
we had ice sacks and incident handling

649
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,080
for our blue team

650
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,640
and in our blue team we had five cert

651
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,200
players

652
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,600
who received around 200 tickets and

653
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,200
emails during the three-day

654
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,480
ttx and on the right side you can see a

655
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,720
blurry picture of what the incident

656
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,600
handling

657
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,840
tool looked like so that picture isn't

658
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,080
finished don't worry about that

659
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,480
and it does not replicate the real

660
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,840
incident handling procedure

661
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,400
that we have but it was a good good uh

662
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,679
simulation of that

663
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,039
so what we really needed to do to handle

664
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,880
both the isaks and the incident

665
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,120
the tickets was that we needed to have a

666
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,720
goal-oriented mindset

667
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
so one was the internal goal setting

668
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,600
what we want to exercise as a ncsc

669
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,760
participating and the other one was

670
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,159
external goal setting so what

671
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,200
um are the go how can we best steer the

672
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,679
other players into the right direction

673
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,240
and here one of the best practices was

674
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,400
to have an active

675
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,240
yeah thank you have an active uh white

676
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,760
team member to steer the

677
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,919
uh blue team to the right direction so

678
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,840
finding the signal from the noise

679
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,320
and how to best serve those players and

680
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,360
next slide please

681
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,440
and one of the things that we really

682
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,600
found interesting was the model for

683
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,279
major incident management so this is

684
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,720
something that we've been in the process

685
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,200
of

686
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,120
developing for quite some time at the

687
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,320
ncsc

688
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,720
and now we found a way to practice and

689
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,200
exercise that in the other 20

690
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,919
and when we tested that model in a in a

691
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:22,400
kind of a

692
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,360
controlled test laboratory we found very

693
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,320
very

694
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,400
good and valuable insights into what we

695
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,080
can do to better enhance it

696
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,640
moving forward and it's a definite tool

697
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,320
for public private partnership in

698
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,200
going on in the future and we know we

699
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,520
noticed that there's a lot of demand for

700
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,919
such similar models for private sector

701
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,840
critical infrastructure providers

702
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,360
so this is definitely one of the

703
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,039
insights and the act

704
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,520
parts of what we could say the lessons

705
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,320
learned

706
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,159
so now we have a two minute warning i

707
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,960
think we need to move on auntie

708
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,200
and lessons learned and please um could

709
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,720
you put the next slide on please

710
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,240
well about surely about the organizing

711
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,000
such an exercise

712
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,120
it's really an essential to select the

713
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,400
target sectors

714
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,880
and the sector companies early on in the

715
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,480
process and and start to make the

716
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,159
stakeholder communications really

717
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,159
required for that uh the most important

718
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,720
work uh was all perhaps the background

719
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,159
story creation

720
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,360
and uh even selecting the everyday

721
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,919
tools in the use of the exercise and as

722
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,360
mentioned uh we are

723
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,840
moving towards that that we should be

724
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,240
using the tools that we are using in the

725
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,120
everyday

726
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,159
life in these exercises

727
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,480
and we have to reserve time and time

728
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,600
again uh to

729
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,799
induct to participants even

730
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,120
especially within these kind of long

731
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,640
exercises that we had

732
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,080
uh due to goblet 19 crisis and of course

733
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,159
the networking part is something that we

734
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,600
will still be having

735
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,840
in the future because uh the code

736
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,960
prevented that

737
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,600
so far what key findings you had couple

738
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,960
julia yes i think we will need to save

739
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,399
most of them for our

740
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,200
speakers q a later on but you can read

741
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
some the summary of our key findings

742
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,320
here

743
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,799
so we had ice groups and the model for

744
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,399
major incident management from

745
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,919
ncsc's side which were terribly useful

746
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,279
and we will definitely

747
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,919
enhance them in the future yeah and we

748
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:28,559
had

749
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,799
we found out many and many topics that

750
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,960
we will be improving in the future and

751
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,360
and uh based on the feedback the

752
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
participants felt that it was really a

753
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,120
useful

754
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,640
exercise absolutely and we will be

755
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,320
developing that further in the

756
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,360
theater 22 exercise and uh we will

757
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,600
be aiming for international cooperation

758
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,279
there as well

759

years

766
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,760
where he manages the cyber operations

767
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,600
and incident response unit

768
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,480
in the israel national cyber directorate

769
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,240
i'll remind everyone again

770
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,440
q a is available via work adventure then

771
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,399
the floor is yours

772
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,039

yeah and we see your screen

776
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,240
thank you hank it's nice to see you

777
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,279
again

778
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,320
uh so i will try to explain to you to

779
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,440
describe

780
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,799
a nice incident that we handled

781
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,559
just recently and i will try to explain

782
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,320
during that the next 30 minutes or so

783
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,840
on on the reasons that we act how we act

784
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,960
what we do and maybe how we do it

785
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,679
mainly on the tactic level of how we

786
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,039
investigate and what

787
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,840
are the reasons that we investigate

788
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,480
certain

789
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,840
incidents and on the other hand is

790
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,480
what we do that in the nation level and

791
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,360
how we

792
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,520
mitigate such an incident

793
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,960
so um just a quick

794
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,919
intro i've been a part for in the

795
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,679
business cyber security business for the

796
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:36,000
last

797
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,200
20 years private sector government

798
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,000
sector

799
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,120
and national security agencies i've been

800
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,240
all around

801
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,919
doing regulatory work and other jobs

802
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,200
all over in the last three almost four

803
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:51,679
years

804
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,679
i've been part of the incident responded

805
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,679
cyber operation i'm actually leading

806
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:56,480
that group

807
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,120
within the incd and all the operative

808
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,640
incidents that we're handling are under

809
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,600
my responsibility

810
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,640
so imcd is actually

811
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,799
holding a 24 7 365 days

812
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,159
a call center which actually

813
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,440
serves as a as a first aid for any

814
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,399
organization

815
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,559
in israel that wants to have help

816
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,360
regarding any incident that he's having

817
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,159
or he's suspicious of suspecting of

818
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,200
having

819
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,240
so everyone can call that a hotline

820
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,799
receive a human answer you can send

821
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,000
email as well

822
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,679
and get a help or first aid help

823
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,519
there are different kinds of methods

824
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,760
that we help organizations

825
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,760
some of them are just offering a

826
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,360
playbook some of them

827
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,559
are asking them to go

828
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,440
to the private sector and ask help from

829
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,960
another company

830
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,519
it depends on the situation it depends

831
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,720
on our special

832
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,080
specialty and our added value that we

833
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,120
can

834
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,279
offer so our incident starts on

835
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,960
august 31st when we get

836
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,159
three calls from different organizations

837
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,679
regarding a suspicious email potentially

838
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,279
a malicious email

839
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,760
that the same retailer electronics

840
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,880
retailer

841
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,000
has sent to them one of them was

842
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,120
stopped the with the meta relay or

843
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,080
you know defense system and some of them

844
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,279
actually managed to

845
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,480
get through now

846
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,080
that is not uncommon within incd

847
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,840
and just to give you a taste of what

848
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,760
we're handling

849
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,159
there are roughly 1312

850
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,679
fishing events that we receive a year

851
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,360
now remind you 2020 corona

852
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,799
year we are all handling different kind

853
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,879
of

854
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,279
situation and once we

855
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,000
expected maybe hoped that the cyber

856
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,640
incident

857
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,720
will be the amount will be

858
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,080
descending we found out that it actually

859
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,960
got a bit worse so no one actually

860
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,120
thought that would be the consequence

861
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,960
but during the

862
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,760
three months of july august and

863
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,240
september which is around the time

864
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,360
of this incident we found an increase of

865
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,519
the

866
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,840
phishing incidents that were reported to

867
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,640
us

868
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,279
the challenge is what do we do with such

869
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,720
a number it's very hard

870
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,480
to investigate and perform a forensic

871
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,559
investigation on each and every one of

872
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:51,600
them

873
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,399
our call center or 119 which offers the

874
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,840
first aid performs

875
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,880
initial checks and through that we

876
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,080
understand and decide how we operate

877
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,960
around that incident incident now

878
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,359
in order to understand better what is

879
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,800
the damage potential

880
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,639
from that indication from that

881
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,239
electronics retailer

882
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,960
we performed a weapon check around that

883
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,480
organization

884
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,960
we found some interesting information

885
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,159
which was

886
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,440
actually available to everyone we found

887
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,679
that is working with

888
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,639
critical infrastructure organization it

889
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,800
was working with government offices

890
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,239
it was working with almost every sector

891
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,760
of the public sector within israel

892
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,199
so i can only assume that you will agree

893
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,000
with me

894
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,239
that it needs special attention from

895
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,520
imcd

896
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,320
that is what we thought and we decided

897
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,159
that we need to perform a deeper

898
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,520
investigation

899
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,440
and actually give special resources

900
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,640
to that organization

901
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,839
from that moment we decided to send

902
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,680
a field manager one of our guys uh

903
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,599
directly to that organization

904
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,839
that is one of the methods that we work

905
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,359
in order to

906
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,599
gather more information now that is very

907
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,960
challenging

908
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,599
for a government office to call a

909
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,119
private company and say hi

910
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,760
this is the imcd we want to interest you

911
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,160
in

912
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,240
some information that we have we got

913
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,160
reports of something that may be

914
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,760
happening within your network

915
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,240
and that is very challenging for them to

916
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,440
accept that

917
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,880
as uh something for their own beneficial

918
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,160
and is a part of our job to try and

919
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,599
convince them and to

920
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,320
let them understand a little bit better

921
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:46,960
that

922
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,359
what we do and how we do it we work with

923
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,040
full cooperation

924
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,240
and with um

925
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,000
almost always a complete transparent

926
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,200
activities with the organization and we

927
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,040
offer our services not only

928
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,640
to investigate the organization in order

929
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,200
to

930
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,200
remove the threat from that specific

931
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,680
network but in order to gather

932
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,400
what is needed in order to share the

933
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,599
information

934
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,400
to the other uh to the whole public

935
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,320
sector within israel the industry is

936
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,960
government

937
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,160
everyone who is a part of our mailing

938
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,880
list and etc

939
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,000
so at that point we actually

940
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,800
contact that organization and to our

941
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,079
surprise

942
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,480
we got full cooperation and we started

943
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,280
performing

944
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,160
our first activities within the

945
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,960
organization's network

946
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,400
okay that was on the

947
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,839
september 1st we are now

948
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,240
conducting our investigation and urging

949
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,599
to find

950
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,599
some some indications

951
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,040
of first activity starting

952
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,720
no february 2020

953
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,760
that means around seven months of the

954
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,560
attacker doing whatever he wants within

955
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,000
that organization

956
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,920
and i will show you a few things that we

957
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,240
found

958
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,320
as you can see and guess there is a

959
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,280
huge activity within that network but

960
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,640
we'll try to give you

961
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,040
some advance some examples of things

962
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,440
that we found

963
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,800
first of all the initial access vector

964
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,760
was using two vulnerabilities public

965
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,680
vulnerabilities that everyone

966
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,320
knew but the most important

967
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,040
thing for us was to find that the

968
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,320
release date was

969
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,079
february 11 and the

970
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,200
the player that actually got access to

971
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,800
that organization

972
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,920
did this two or three days after the

973
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,079
release of that vulnerability after the

974
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,680
rest of the

975
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,440
rce it was very worrying for us and that

976
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:09,839
was

977
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,920
very quick relatively to other things

978
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,040
that we've seen

979
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,119
and it was very interesting to see that

980
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,400
and understand what he was uh looking

981
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:20,720
for

982
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,560
of course that made us uh very alert to

983
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:24,880
all

984
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,960
other vulnerabilities and trying to find

985
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,000
mechanism on

986
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,240
how to find uh

987
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,480
other organizations that were attacked

988
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,079
by that specific

989
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,400
uh vulnerability and i will explain a

990
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,280
little bit that

991
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,800
a little bit later so a little bit uh

992
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,680
on what he did there so we've seen them

993
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,079
use the vulnerability gain access

994
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,640
running mimikats in order to gather

995
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,560
whatever is needed from that

996
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,760
directory we've seen him use a open

997
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,720
source web shell

998
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,680
in order to gain persistence and

999
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,079
schedule tasks which run on a weekly

1000
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,200
basis

1001
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,400
um we've seen them even

1002
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,760
try to get to other customers of that

1003
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,200
organization

1004
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,040
and one of the things that we've seen is

1005
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,160
what remember the emails that they

1006
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,280
sent through that organization so

1007
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,839
we investigated a little bit on that and

1008
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,760
we've seen

1009
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,119
the of that

1010
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,079
work now the interesting thing about

1011
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:32,960
this

1012
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,160
is i know you can't most of you may most

1013
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,920
of you can't read hebrew

1014
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,400
but i can assure you this is very good

1015
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,680
hebrew

1016
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,440
and i can assure you that the guy

1017
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,560
who did this is not a native hebrew

1018
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,920
speaker

1019
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,119
i can sign on that now

1020
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,880
one other thing that is very interesting

1021
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,640
remember i said he was there for seven

1022
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,520
months

1023
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,560
this email was actually part of

1024
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,000
a business process that was made with

1025
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,760
one of the customers

1026
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,200
and he was actually replying a message

1027
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,200
with a very legit syntax that says

1028
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,920
that actually continued the conversation

1029
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,440
and persuaded the victim

1030
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,319
to open the link now once it opened the

1031
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,760
link

1032
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,119
a zip file was downloaded from there

1033
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,280
two things happened first registration

1034
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,599
with the canary token and the other one

1035
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,720
is the payload

1036
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,520
which actually

1037
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,960
contained the malware itself

1038
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,480
which actually allowed the the attacker

1039
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,960
to do whatever he wanted in there

1040
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,119
one thing that was very strange for us

1041
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,079
once the

1042
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,560
file the payload was activated there was

1043
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,520
a window

1044
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,800
windows defender summary fake alert

1045
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,839
on that client that said don't worry

1046
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,920
everything is okay please continue your

1047
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,240
work and everything will be all right

1048
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,200
now that's one method that we've seen

1049
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,640
actually happen the other method was

1050
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,000
just sending the url directly the url

1051
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,079
without an attachment

1052
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,280
the url will open the same

1053
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,119
info docx with registration to the

1054
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,319
canary token

1055
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,520
and from there a payload with the same

1056
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,720
issues and the same method transmitting

1057
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,319
to a c2 server

1058
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:36,319
and from there everything was uh free

1059
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,240
the attacker was free to work the

1060
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,160
interesting thing about this

1061
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,720
method is once the uh

1062
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,000
sorry about the previous method once the

1063
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,560
attacker opened the attachment

1064
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,079
the thing that what he saw was a legit

1065
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,800
document that was relevant to that

1066
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,520
specific

1067
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,240
business process and that specific

1068
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,359
document

1069
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,839
was part of the attack itself so

1070
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,560
we found it very interesting to see the

1071
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,560
relevance that the

1072
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,480
attacker made to the specific business

1073
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,839
process of the organization

1074
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,800
sorry about that just a second

1075
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,720
okay so we've seen the initial access

1076
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,319
we've seen the maybe cuts we've

1077
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:29,839
identified the web shells and the

1078
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:30,960
schedule tasks

1079
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,359
we created a heat map of the

1080
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,760
organization of where of where

1081
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,079
the attacker got access to where he left

1082
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,359
his persistence

1083
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,079
and we managed to clear that to clear

1084
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,760
all that

1085
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,960
on top of that as we all know once you

1086
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,079
clean and remove the threat you have to

1087
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:50,400
do

1088
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,520
some defense actions in order to make

1089
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:53,920
sure

1090
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,119
you won't come back so the organization

1091
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:57,440
got

1092
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,480
recommendations from us so

1093
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,240
to actually prevent the return of that

1094
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,839
specific attacker

1095
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:09,440
he managed to patch the vpn patch the

1096
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,280
exchange server put a mfa

1097
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,560
on the users connecting from

1098
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,200
remote access and change all the

1099
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,000
passwords

1100
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,040
within the organization which as we all

1101
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:23,760
know

1102
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,280
is not that easy to do on a

1103
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,560
a a a live and operational

1104
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,720
organization but as as he understood the

1105
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,200
threat

1106
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,839
as he understood the potential of losing

1107
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,599
his his business

1108
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,520
he stopped every stopped everything and

1109
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,359
actually did that

1110
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,960
as part of our methodology

1111
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,920
we've seen attackers get back to the

1112
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,079
same organizations because they are very

1113
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,040
interested in what's going on over there

1114
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,720
and what's

1115
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,119
in how they can continue because they

1116
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,400
found a good thing

1117
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,800
they've been there for seven months they

1118
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,720
want to return once they're kicked out

1119
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,000
of the organization

1120
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,640
so we leave our monitoring equipment

1121
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,359
there

1122
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,599
and one thing we see is on september 15

1123
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,640
the attacker returns to the network and

1124
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,599
gains full control over everything that

1125
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:22,319
is

1126
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,520
uh left there

1127
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,880
may not mean mimi cuts schedule tasks

1128
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,319
all over again with all the power that

1129
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:33,119
he needed

1130
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,240
and full access again

1131
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,839
we were let's

1132
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,960
call it we were surprised of the quick

1133
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,800
ability for him to get back to that

1134
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,359
organization

1135
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,680
what we found out once we tracked that

1136
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,400
back

1137
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,960
we found something very interesting

1138
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,560
through the business process of that

1139
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,800
organization they're using

1140
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,079
remote control applications some of them

1141
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,720
they use and some of the ones you see

1142
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,520
here

1143
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,599
they do not use the the player itself

1144
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:08,480
the attacker

1145
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,920
installed remote control on

1146
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,119
the developers

1147
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,240
computers their pcs and

1148
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,920
without them noticing he created users

1149
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,400
specific users and managed to get back

1150
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,359
there

1151
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,400
by the way at the start of our

1152
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,160
investigation

1153
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,720
we asked whether they know this kind of

1154
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,640
remote control applications and we

1155
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,920
indicated them

1156
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,720
to the organization and they didn't have

1157
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,760
a clue

1158
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,079
so they didn't want to remove them

1159
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,960
interesting of course once we found that

1160
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,440
and we managed to

1161
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,119
investigate that the organization

1162
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:59,359
removed the remote control application

1163
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,920
it changed again all the password with

1164
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,800
all

1165
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,359
the meaning of that regarding the

1166
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,680
business logic

1167
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,760
he reduced the remote control software

1168
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,760
to one and now he's working

1169
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,280
only with that application

1170
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,480
now um

1171
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,079
in order to understand a little bit

1172
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,680
better this incident

1173
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,800
first of all as i mentioned before imcd

1174
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,599
is conducting forensic investigation in

1175
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:28,000
an

1176
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,560
organization in order to extract

1177
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,040
whatever is needed the indications

1178
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,720
of that attack and share them

1179
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,240
quickly and widely as possible

1180
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,160
in this case we issued a tlp white alert

1181
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,960
which has all the information regarding

1182
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,480
the ttps

1183
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,720
regarding what he did how he did it

1184
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,599
when he did it and with some of course

1185
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,240
examples

1186
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,319
not only the degree that we actually

1187
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:01,760
shared over 300

1188
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,680
indicators that are relevant to that

1189
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,839
attack that's a lot

1190
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:09,599
to one campaign i'm sorry

1191
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,839
now if you want to know how we how we

1192
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,240
share our information because that's

1193
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,520
very important for us to uh

1194
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:22,000
actually expose that we have a specific

1195
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,200
portal that is called cybernet which

1196
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:25,760
actually

1197
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,200
connects uh all sorts of organizations

1198
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,440
cisos stocks uh several

1199
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,480
security companies within israel

1200
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,960
that are part of this community and that

1201
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,640
platforms allows us

1202
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,079
to share quickly very quickly

1203
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,319
almost directly to the

1204
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,319
security devices of several

1205
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:51,839
organizations

1206
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,960
indicators that may be

1207
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,359
not maybe but there are malicious that

1208
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,760
we can sign that they are malicious

1209
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,960
so we issued a quick type a tlp

1210
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,240
white alert in order to

1211
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,000
protect our public sector and in order

1212
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,480
to

1213
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,520
receive feedback on whether or not they

1214
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,800
identified

1215
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,319
even more activities as such that were

1216
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:21,680
described in our alert

1217
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,839
so

1218
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,240
on top of that of course we should a

1219
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,240
report to the retailer

1220
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,440
describing exactly what we did how we

1221
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,240
did it

1222
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,200
and what we did within the organization

1223
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,960
including

1224
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,400
all the findings that we got and

1225
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,640
from there we moved on um

1226
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,319
our investigation showed

1227
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,960
three distributors three main

1228
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,640
distributors

1229
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,280
uh that were actually part of that

1230
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,400
campaign

1231
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,520
all the distributors were exploited

1232
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,160
by the same method the exchange

1233
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,359
vulnerabilities

1234
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,079
they were used in order to spread the

1235
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:12,720
spear

1236
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,319
phishing emails they were

1237
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:19,520
at that point the same method very

1238
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,119
uh oriented to the victim

1239
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,880
with very convincing method in order to

1240
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,200
click whatever they wanted them to click

1241
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,319
and

1242
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:34,160
we've seen them use all sorts of

1243
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,160
recipients as you can see a small amount

1244
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,280
of recipients

1245
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,119
to a large number of addresses that were

1246
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,319
actually the victims

1247
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,359
these three distributors were

1248
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,680
investigated by us

1249
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,520
and we've seen them once we've seen the

1250
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,319
first one we managed to find

1251
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:57,520
the same actor on the same

1252
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,440
on the the other distributor with the

1253
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,319
same tools and the same method

1254
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,400
so it was very easy and very quick to

1255
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,680
understand

1256
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,599
now just to tell you

1257
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,800
on another action that we took regarding

1258
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,440
the

1259
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,319
mitigation of that attack on a national

1260
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:17,119
scale

1261
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,760
once we discovered the two

1262
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,160
vulnerabilities were exported

1263
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,800
we have a special team that is in charge

1264
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,400
of scanning

1265
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,839
the entire israeli

1266
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:34,160
cyber service and trying to detect

1267
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,720
organizations that are vulnerable they

1268
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,440
use

1269
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,200
all the tools that you can imagine

1270
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,559
showdown and

1271
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,040
some other tools that are actually

1272
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,400
self-developed

1273
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,800
and through those tools they manage to

1274
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,920
create

1275
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,040
create at least a huge list of

1276
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,040
organizations that are vulnerable to

1277
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,240
those

1278
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,440
vulnerabilities trying to understand

1279
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,000
which of the organizations are behind

1280
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,839
those ip addresses

1281
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:05,760
and contacting them specifically

1282
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,599
our national cert or 119

1283
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,839
call center actually calls each and

1284
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,040
every company

1285
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,359
and make sure first they know that they

1286
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:16,480
are vulnerable

1287
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,680
second make sure they close and update

1288
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,079
whatever it is needed to be updated

1289
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,319
it's those vulnerabilities and others

1290
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:29,760
on the same on the same time

1291
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,280
so once we discovered the three

1292
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,200
three distributors once we handle that

1293
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,079
we managed to create a whole map of

1294
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,359
everything that

1295
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:46,558
happened what we've seen is that

1296
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,280
by october mid-october which is around

1297
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,559
let's say six weeks from when we started

1298
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,400
the initial investigation the first

1299
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,839
investigation at the

1300
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,880
electronic retailer we've seen 167

1301
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,240
organizations

1302
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,920
that were hit by that campaign

1303
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,920
and by hit i mean not only that they got

1304
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,160
the specific mail with a specific

1305
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,200
attachment or

1306
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,480
link but they opened it some of them

1307
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,440
were blocked

1308
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,079
some of them were not block blocked most

1309
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:20,960
of them

1310
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,240
were not and dative identified by

1311
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,440
any by any

1312
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,839
defense mechanism

1313
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:34,240
and we were very worried that

1314
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,520
this might spread to other organizations

1315
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,440
and the numbers will multiply

1316
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,960
finding more distributors

1317
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,480
were one of our worried worries

1318
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,599
we did not find any more

1319
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,520
distributors and let's say that

1320
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,119
by the start of the november

1321
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:59,920
we managed to contain the entire

1322
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,960
campaign

1323
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,400
and make sure that all the proper

1324
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,839
antivirus companies security companies

1325
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:11,280
would sign and

1326
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,920
make sure that they know all the

1327
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,359
indications that we had

1328
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,680
all the iocs were shared with them as

1329
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,160
well in order to

1330
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,010
deal with that in a wider

1331
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:24,000
[Music]

1332
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,520
matter there are some questions that are

1333
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,319
left

1334
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:32,400
open regarding the specific campaign

1335
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,319
it was very wide on a large

1336
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,520
amount of different sectors that we did

1337
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,319
not understand

1338
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:43,839
why or how or when

1339
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,480
some insights regarding some insights

1340
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,920
regarding the

1341
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,520
incident itself we found that

1342
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,720
having a call center which is accessible

1343
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,000
to the public

1344
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,920
sector is very very very effective

1345
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,280
in the our role as a

1346
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,599
national cyber security actor

1347
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,200
part of our role is to defend and to

1348
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,559
mitigate and

1349
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,079
probably as much as we can prevent

1350
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,400
cyber incidents as the one that i

1351
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,680
described

1352
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,319
here from happening within the israel

1353
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,800
cyber arena

1354
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,200
normally the indication comes from the

1355
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,000
organization

1356
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,160
where they are let's say aware enough

1357
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,440
to raise the flag call us and say listen

1358
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,000
i suspect

1359
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,559
something as i mentioned earlier there

1360
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,079
are a lot of false positive

1361
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,680
and it takes a lot of resources to

1362
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,319
handle that but we try to develop

1363
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,520
the methodology uh the understanding

1364
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,960
from our experience on how to find

1365
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,960
the the specific ones that can

1366
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,720
allow us to identify as quickly as

1367
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,480
we can and as effectively as we can the

1368
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,480
potential pandemia within our arena

1369
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,000
so we see huge advantage in working with

1370
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,200
the public sector

1371
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,599
we understand that it is the most

1372
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,680
important player within

1373
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:22,240
our ability to handle such incidents

1374
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,440
and on as part of

1375
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,040
the general director agenda we are

1376
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,520
going to extend the cooperation and

1377
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,200
collaboration with the

1378
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,319
public center exactly and

1379
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:39,119
specifically to prevent these kinds of

1380
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,079
events

1381
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:42,960
of happening within our nation three

1382
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,240
million

1383
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,880
three-minute warning so i'm i'm i'm

1384
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:47,599
actually

1385
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,799
pretty done so

1386
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:54,559
as of now everything is uh

1387
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,160
actually not so quiet within

1388
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,280
our cyber incident arena but the

1389
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,440
specific campaign

1390
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,079
is no longer working within our

1391
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:12,079
arena as far as we know of course

1392
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:16,480
and that's it for me hank

1393
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,640
excellent presentation i truly enjoyed

1394
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,119
it i hope that everyone else did

1395
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,200
and hopefully one day we will be able to

1396
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,880
see each other physically and not do it

1397
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,480
via this

1398
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,000
cyber platform but everyone should

1399
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,119
go to the uh work uh adventure and

1400
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,240
basically

1401
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,799
put in their questions to ken there and

1402
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:37,839
uh we now

1403
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,799
um will be signing off uh to the next

1404
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:41,599
session so

1405
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,520
everyone goodbye and thank you for

daniel woods uh daniel

1415
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,520
is researches the economics of security

1416
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,520
and privacy with the recent research on

1417
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,800
risk

1418
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,960
quantifications cyber insurance and

1419
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,239
online consent

1420
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:22,560
he is currently a post doctoral fellow

1421
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,640

cool great so i will just share my

1425
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,840
screen

1426
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:41,769
[Music]

1427
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:48,000
cool yeah so i'm daniel woods and today

1428
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,440
i will be speaking to you all

1429
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:52,320
about incident response as a lawyer's

1430
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,520
service

1431
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:57,520
so um this is about kind of the economic

1432
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:57,840
and

1433
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,920
business structure surrounding how

1434
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,080
incident response is carried out

1435
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,560
and i will try to touch on kind of how

1436
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,520
that flows through into the technical

1437
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,679
implications of how incident responses

1438
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:10,640
carried out

1439
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,640
but just to kind of flag up front this

1440
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,080
is a non-technical talk

1441
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,440
about kind of yeah the business

1442
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:18,159
structure surrounding incident response

1443
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:21,360
now this title kind of tries to invoke

1444
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,800
this populist idea

1445
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,440
that yeah lawyers might be taking over

1446
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,440
instant response and of course that's a

1447
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:28,640
provocative title

1448
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,120
kind of yeah intended to produce

1449
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,880
discussion and there's more nuance than

1450
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:33,600
that

1451
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,440
and equally this talk could have been

1452
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,080
called how cyber insurance shapes

1453
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,960
incident response so yeah i will present

1454
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:41,760
the slides

1455
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,280
and then i look forward to discussing

1456
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,360
this with you because this is a very

1457
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,320
practitioner focused talk

1458
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,480
so this whole research project actually

1459
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,840
started with this tweet

1460
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:55,920
by pierre where he is expressing concern

1461
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,120
that incident response or at least who

1462
01:17:59,120 --> 01:17:59,840
carries out

1463
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:02,480
incident response is being determined by

1464
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,239
cyber insurance

1465
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:07,679
and i have in my phd investigated

1466
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:10,560
the cyber insurance market so i had a

1467
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,719
rough idea of how this might be working

1468
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:14,560
but then i kind of embarked on this

1469
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,920
research project

1470
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,560
trying to understand how this works how

1471
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,080
does cyber insurance shape

1472
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,679
insulin response and this used

1473
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:26,239
a variety of methods but in particular

1474
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:27,840
expert interviews where i spoke to

1475
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,840
people in this ecosystem

1476
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,840
and one thing that really emerged is

1477
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,239
it's not just that cyber insurance

1478
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:37,040
kind of influences which ir funds are

1479
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,239
selected

1480
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:41,199
actually there's this additional actor

1481
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:42,320
breach coaches

1482
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,400
they're lawyers uh depending how you

1483
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,400
call them external counsel

1484
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,040
they are also playing a really big role

1485
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:49,600
in

1486
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:54,239
incident response um so yeah that is how

1487
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:56,239
that kind of provides the motivation for

1488
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:58,400
this talk and we break the talk down

1489
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,600
into three sections

1490
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,159
so first i would like to sketch to you

1491
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:04,080
what incident response as a lawyer's

1492
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,760
service looks like

1493
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:09,040
um then i would like to kind of

1494
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:11,199
look into why it's coming about now

1495
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:12,719
because this actually has quite a

1496
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:14,560
significant break from how

1497
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,480
incident response was carried out or at

1498
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,679
least planned

1499
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:20,960
traditionally and so the middle section

1500
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,199
looks at what is driving this shift and

1501
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:25,280
we basically identify two issues

1502
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,600
first there's litigation risk and the

1503
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,320
second is

1504
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,640
cyber insurance and then the final

1505
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,560
section of this talk will try to yeah

1506
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,199
kind of

1507
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:37,839
pull apart the future lacking aspects

1508
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,800
cool so to understand hotline incident

1509
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,640
response it's useful to think about a

1510
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:43,840
victim fan

1511
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,000
and they suffer an incident and here

1512
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,440
when we use incident

1513
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:50,000
we kind of mean incidents that are

1514
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,600
interesting to the board

1515
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,679
so we're not talking about incidents in

1516
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:55,760
the sense of the security policy has

1517
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:56,960
been violated

1518
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,360
say there's an authentication failure no

1519
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,080
this is

1520
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,239
things like ransomware data breach

1521
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:04,320
business email compromise

1522
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:08,000
and so the way hotline incident response

1523
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:08,639
works out

1524
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:11,199
is upon discovering this incident the

1525
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:12,159
victim firm

1526
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:14,560
immediately calls external counsel

1527
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,080
external counsel

1528
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:19,360
and delegates all responsibility to

1529
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,600
external counsel i'm just gonna take a

1530
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,280
brief check that sound is

1531
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:27,679
okay um yeah

1532
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:30,159
i think it is cool so everything gets

1533
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:31,199
delegated to

1534
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:34,239
external counsel and

1535
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:37,679
and then actually it is

1536
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:41,040
whoops external counsel who decide what

1537
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,080
happens next

1538
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:45,360
so they hire a technical person to go

1539
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,520
into the system and investigate because

1540
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,960
of the incident the scope of the

1541
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,320
incident

1542
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:53,199
um but in addition external council

1543
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:55,520
control maybe if public relations

1544
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,679
professionals are kind of brought in to

1545
01:20:57,679 --> 01:20:59,600
help communicate externally

1546
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,440
i know jason nurse gave a talk about

1547
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,520
this earlier in the conference

1548
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,760
um or they might also hire logistics

1549
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,480
firms to help with say credit monitoring

1550
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:13,040
or also um say notifying individuals

1551
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,400
things like printing letters

1552
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,560
sending letters which actually become a

1553
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,880
big logistical problem with the scale of

1554
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:21,679
data breaches they will also advise or

1555
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:24,159
potentially liaise with law enforcement

1556
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:25,440
and regulators

1557
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,000
so the important aspect of this slide is

1558
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,120
that you see

1559
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,679
lawyers are at the center of breach

1560
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:32,560
response

1561
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,040
so to invoke a kind of american sports

1562
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,080
analogy

1563
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,239
lawyers are acting as the breach coach

1564
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:39,360
sorry the um

1565
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,199
quarterback of incident response they're

1566
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:43,679
deciding who gets brought in

1567
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:47,440
and and whether they get brought in

1568
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,679
but a separate way of looking at the

1569
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:50,719
difference between

1570
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:52,800
kind of hotline incident response and

1571
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,719
traditional incident response

1572
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:57,600
is to look at the timeline and this

1573
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,679
really kind of highlights the contrast

1574
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:02,239
so in conventional incident response

1575
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:04,080
it always begins with the planning

1576
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,400
before an incident has even occurred

1577
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,320
so the organization write the incident

1578
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:09,719
response plan that delegates

1579
01:22:09,719 --> 01:22:11,120
responsibilities

1580
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,120
it may also set up monitoring

1581
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,159
infrastructure to continually monitor

1582
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:18,880
and network and it puts a plan in place

1583
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:19,760
what happens

1584
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:23,040
when an incident is detected how is

1585
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,920
um how are decisions kind of elevated

1586
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,600
through the hierarchy

1587
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,960
and yeah so the point here is that

1588
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,719
conventional incident response

1589
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:36,080
always had this xnt aspect and i think

1590
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:38,159
an important thing to consider here is

1591
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:40,080
that actually requires a lot of

1592
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,320
information security maturity

1593
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,159
the organization needs to appreciate

1594
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:46,320
that cyber security is a risk that

1595
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,639
may threaten their organization and to

1596
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:50,239
put this plan in place

1597
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:52,320
whereas that's potentially less true for

1598
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,159
hotline incident response

1599
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:57,040
so here we kind of contrast that hotline

1600
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,239
incident response

1601
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:00,000
begins when the incident has been

1602
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,639
detected so the victim firm says

1603
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:05,040
oh we have say a ransomware incident or

1604
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,080
perhaps someone else

1605
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,440
notifies them that they've been

1606
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,280
compromised and

1607
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,520
and then it begins when the breach coach

1608
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,000
is hired so they call a breach coach

1609
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,400
and set up a contract and then it kind

1610
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,239
of all unfolds from there

1611
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:20,080
and a second difference that's maybe

1612
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,280
worth emphasizing

1613
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:24,080
is hotline incident response is driven

1614
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:24,560
by

1615
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,880
litigation risk so the lawyers are very

1616
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,960
aware that potentially the organization

1617
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,560
will be sued

1618
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:33,280
and sued in the future and that shapes

1619
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,719
the incident response

1620
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:37,040
now of course this dichotomy is kind of

1621
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,960
somewhat artificial because

1622
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,800
in a conventional incident response plan

1623
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,719
you may bring a lawyer in it may even be

1624
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:44,000
an external lawyer

1625
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,400
you still are concerned about litigation

1626
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,840
but here we're trying to kind of tease

1627
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,320
apart the differences

1628
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:53,280
cool so a very real question very fair

1629
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,880
question that you might ask me now

1630
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,800
is okay so you've described this model

1631
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,159
of incident response

1632
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:01,520
but yeah is it important is it prevalent

1633
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,360
and yeah here i'm kind of pulling

1634
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,760
together a few industry statistics so

1635
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,600
crowdstrike report that

1636
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,600
half of their investigations are under

1637
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,800
this model

1638
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,360
of incident response so that is where

1639
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:14,480
external council

1640
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:17,760
and external lawyer directs and

1641
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,960
directs the forensic professionals

1642
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,840
and there's a company who run a market

1643
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:24,400
survey

1644
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,080
of firms in the cyber insurance

1645
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:27,520
ecosystem

1646
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,320
and they discover or they survey 23 law

1647
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,400
firms who collectively have managed

1648
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,920
almost 5 000 breaches in 2018

1649
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:38,000
and of course here we run into the usual

1650
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,679
problem with industry reports

1651
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:42,000
what is a breach what is an incident but

1652
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,480
i think the scale here is important

1653
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:48,000
and particularly of these 5 000 breaches

1654
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,400
sorry of these 23 law firms it doesn't

1655
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:51,280
even include

1656
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,520
all the law firms who are operating as

1657
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:54,480
kind of

1658
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,040
yeah breach coach or i'm running

1659
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,199
incident response as a lawyer's service

1660
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:01,280
so there's another firm baker hustetler

1661
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:03,040
who also claimed to have worked

1662
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:06,719
over 750 incidents this firm's useful

1663
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:07,600
because they

1664
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,560
publish um yearly reports and we can see

1665
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,280
that

1666
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:14,719
they grew from 200 incidents in 2014 to

1667
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:15,920
over a thousand in

1668
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:20,000
2020 and i don't have definitive

1669
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,800
evidence about this but i suspect

1670
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,159
incident response of the lawyer's

1671
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:24,800
service

1672
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,040
has followed this yeah kind of a similar

1673
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,639
growth pattern to baker hustle

1674
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:32,880
there but across the whole industry

1675
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,520
cool so now we've kind of outlined this

1676
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,040
model of instant response

1677
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:40,480
and the kind of natural next question is

1678
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:44,080
why has it come to be so clean attorney

1679
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:44,800
privilege

1680
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,400
plays a huge role in this so of the

1681
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,639
law firms who claim to run the most

1682
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:51,679
incidents or

1683
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:53,199
in the past who have ran the most

1684
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,040
incidents

1685
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:58,000
i think of the top four all four operate

1686
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,159
under the breach coach trademark

1687
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:01,679
so yeah you've probably heard me name

1688
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:03,360
drop this a lot if you're

1689
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,639
speaking to people in the cyber

1690
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:07,679
insurance ecosystem you basically call

1691
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:09,360
yeah lawyers who help with incident

1692
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,199
response breach coaches

1693
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:14,480
um but potentially it's unfamiliar

1694
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:18,000
so the trademark holders blog explains

1695
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,320
that the most important thing that a

1696
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,520
breach coach does

1697
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,320
is protect claim attorney privilege and

1698
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,560
this is to do with litigation risk

1699
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,639
so in the course of litigation

1700
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:30,560
potentially the victim firm who have

1701
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,080
suffered the incident

1702
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:35,600
could be sued and as part of that

1703
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,719
the defense attorneys might use some

1704
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:41,120
legal mechanisms around discovery

1705
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:43,440
that would force the victim organization

1706
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:45,760
to kind of publish evidence that's

1707
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,800
relevant

1708
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,280
so with relevance to incident response

1709
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,960
this could be the forensics report

1710
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:51,520
because

1711
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,120
potentially the people who've

1712
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,199
investigated the computer system

1713
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:58,560
after the incident have established that

1714
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,120
basic cyber hygiene wasn't followed

1715
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,199
and this might have kind of yeah

1716
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:05,840
relevance to litigation

1717
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,000
so of course this creates litigation

1718
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:08,880
risk that

1719
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,040
the organization is producing evidence

1720
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,120
that may be used against them

1721
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,360
so one thing that breach coaches offer

1722
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,040
is that they can

1723
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:20,080
claim before courts that that forensics

1724
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:20,639
report

1725
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:22,639
was protected by client attorney

1726
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:23,679
privilege

1727
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:26,080
it was produced in the communications

1728
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,840
between a client and an attorney

1729
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,280
and us law recognizes that this is

1730
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:34,560
um yeah this is a valid reason to not

1731
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,159
publish that evidence

1732
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:37,840
so here we see that one of the most

1733
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:40,000
important things that breach coaches are

1734
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:40,880
doing

1735
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:45,760
is yeah mitigating litigation risk

1736
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:49,440
so the second reason um

1737
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,080
that the breach coach model or incident

1738
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,840
response as a lawyer's service is kind

1739
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:54,400
of

1740
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:57,120
increasing in popularity is related to

1741
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:58,480
cyber insurance

1742
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,159
so there's this survey that i spoke

1743
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:02,000
about before and we ran a kind of

1744
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,679
secondary analysis of this

1745
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:05,440
but essentially there's a really strong

1746
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:08,080
relationship the lawyers who have more

1747
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,440
relationships with

1748
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:12,480
cyber insurance providers also run the

1749
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:13,520
most cases

1750
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:16,000
the most incidents so yeah we see this

1751
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:16,960
relationship

1752
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,639
the more you know the cyber insurance

1753
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:20,960
people the more work you seem to have

1754
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,280
but so this was the point if you recall

1755
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,960
to the motivation slide pierre was

1756
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,480
raising this problem of insurers

1757
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:27,679
gatekeeping work

1758
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:29,679
so we have kind of anecdotal evidence

1759
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,199
that this is going on

1760
01:28:31,199 --> 01:28:33,280
but then what i really wanted to

1761
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,560
understand was

1762
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,960
how do they do this how do insurers

1763
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,320
because this is actually quite a big

1764
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:40,639
problem how do insurers

1765
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:44,000
force a victim fan wow okay so this

1766
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,600
language is quite strong but how do you

1767
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:46,480
insure a shape

1768
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:49,760
which firm the victim uses

1769
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:53,040
um and this is this is a common problem

1770
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,239
so

1771
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:57,040
if for the kind of car drivers among us

1772
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:57,520
we have

1773
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:01,280
auto insurance and parts of the auto

1774
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,280
insurance policy might be that going to

1775
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,840
a mechanic is covered by insurance

1776
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:08,080
and we kind of know in most auto

1777
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:10,400
insurance policies we can't go to

1778
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:13,040
any mechanic the insurer says there is

1779
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:15,040
this list of mechanics who you are

1780
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:16,639
authorized to use

1781
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:19,840
otherwise we won't indemnify um your

1782
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,000
payment

1783
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,280
so insurers cyber insurers do

1784
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:27,040
exactly the same thing it's not

1785
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,480
particularly surprising

1786
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:31,199
but the cyber insurance policy will say

1787
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,000
um

1788
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,800
it explicitly covers vendors on the

1789
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:35,920
panel so this is

1790
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,719
a list of and firms that the insurer

1791
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:39,360
builds

1792
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:41,440
who they're willing to indemnify and

1793
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:43,760
there are additional ways to get

1794
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:47,199
um your incident response firm onto this

1795
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:50,719
panel so for instance this is the

1796
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:52,159
conventional route

1797
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:54,400
so this panel this list of vendors

1798
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:57,120
applies to all of the cyber insurance

1799
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:00,800
and cyber insurers

1800
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,520
customers so if you as a vendor get your

1801
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:04,480
name on this panel

1802
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,800
then potentially you can work for all of

1803
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,080
the um

1804
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,639
customers so this is a very valuable

1805
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:11,840
business opportunity

1806
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,760
and what what we kind of actually find

1807
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:15,440
is that firms are investing

1808
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:18,480
a lot of resources into yeah building

1809
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,400
relationships with insurers to be part

1810
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,560
onto these panels

1811
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,040
um but there is an alternative way which

1812
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,960
i think is important to flag ahead of

1813
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:27,600
time

1814
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,000
so if you already have a relationship

1815
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,600
with the policyholder so

1816
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,280
perhaps you've worked together on pest

1817
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:35,360
incidents you can

1818
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:38,000
ask the policy holder to request that

1819
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:38,880
you are written

1820
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,199
into their policy so this way the

1821
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:42,639
insurer will still

1822
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:45,040
possibly subject to further conditions

1823
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,320
but the insurer will still

1824
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:49,440
indemnify your services so yeah all hope

1825
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,400
is not lost

1826
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,639
just make sure you speak to your clients

1827
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:54,000
so that they

1828
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,679
ensure that you are written into their

1829
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:57,760
policy but importantly here you would

1830
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:01,520
only be written into their policy

1831
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:05,760
so one one thing we can study is we can

1832
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,440
just look to these panels and try to

1833
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,400
understand

1834
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:11,120
who is on the panels which firms are

1835
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,600
insurers saying that after an incident

1836
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:16,880
you can use these phones so we see that

1837
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,120
here so the funds at the bottom are the

1838
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,719
biggest cyber insurers they sell the

1839
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:21,040
most

1840
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,199
insurance and then as we go up they kind

1841
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:25,199
of fall down in the rankings

1842
01:31:25,199 --> 01:31:28,719
so for instance chubb are saying that on

1843
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:29,679
their panel

1844
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:33,280
there are 11 forensics firms exer

1845
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:36,560
is 10. so here we see how

1846
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,920
insurers are gatekeeping work

1847
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:42,000
the work or the majority of the work is

1848
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,520
going to the phones and panel

1849
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:45,360
and actually there's quite a small

1850
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,040
number of

1851
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,800
the kind of potential number of incident

1852
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:51,120
response firms out there

1853
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,440
but then there's a secondary aspect to

1854
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,280
this and this is where breach coaches

1855
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:56,000
come in

1856
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,159
so right now probably you're banging

1857
01:31:58,159 --> 01:32:00,960
your drum cyber insurers are the problem

1858
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:05,199
um but what happens in reality is

1859
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:08,080
the victim firm gets told if you have an

1860
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,920
insulin you should call this hotline

1861
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:10,880
operator

1862
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,199
and most often in the us the hotline

1863
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:14,400
operator

1864
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:17,440
is an external counsel a breach coach

1865
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:20,320
a law firm and they do that because it

1866
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,320
helps with litigation risk it helps to

1867
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,239
claim claim attorney privilege

1868
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:27,040
but what this mean means is that the

1869
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,320
breach coach

1870
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:30,560
can actually recommend to the victim

1871
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:31,440
firm

1872
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:34,719
which forensics provider to hire

1873
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:37,679
so this is where i think i would qualify

1874
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:38,560
pierre's kind of

1875
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,600
initial tweet um because

1876
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,960
actually it's not just that cyber

1877
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:44,880
insurers are gatekeeping work it's also

1878
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,400
that breach coaches have a huge

1879
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,360
influence

1880
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,040
and yeah right now we're talking about

1881
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,880
insulin response potentially technical

1882
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,000
incident response

1883
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,320
but this also impacts which public

1884
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:56,159
relations firms are hired and which

1885
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:58,080
notification and credit monitoring funds

1886
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:59,440
are hired and it

1887
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,760
also affects relationships with law

1888
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,960
enforcement and regulators

1889
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,360
so yeah to kind of summarize this

1890
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,679
insurers ensure work goes to

1891
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:12,719
lawyers by and the forensics firms that

1892
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:14,560
they favor by building this panel of

1893
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:15,520
firms

1894
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:19,520
and the breach hotline operator triages

1895
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:22,239
by recommending specific funds

1896
01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:26,080
um and that hotline operator tends to be

1897
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,400
an external law firm in the us

1898
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,040
and also to get onto the panel perhaps

1899
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:32,480
we missed this

1900
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:34,639
providers must commit to contractual

1901
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:35,600
terms

1902
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,840
so for instance this tends to be things

1903
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,440
like an hourly rate

1904
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:42,000
for complex investigations and even for

1905
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,360
certain investigations

1906
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,360
you have to commit to a fixed price so

1907
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,280
for a business email compromise

1908
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:50,560
it might cost two thousand dollars and

1909
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,400
and most people in the industry will say

1910
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:55,040
that these rates tend to be lower than

1911
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,840
both for a given firm their rate that

1912
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,840
they give to insurers tends to be lower

1913
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,360
around thirty percent

1914
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:04,960
based on my data and and also the firms

1915
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:08,800
who uh yeah are kind of put onto these

1916
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:09,600
shortlists

1917
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:12,239
tend to charge lower rates okay i'm just

1918
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:15,120
being conscious of time

1919
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:18,560
so yeah we don't i mean we don't need to

1920
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,320
labor this but essentially when the

1921
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,320
contract is being negotiated we see a

1922
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:23,120
similar thing

1923
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:25,280
insurers have ultimate approval and a

1924
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,520
lot of aspects of the negotiation has

1925
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:29,280
happened way back in time

1926
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:32,480
when the panel was being built we also

1927
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:34,480
have this weird aspect where

1928
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:36,639
there's kind of these nested contracts

1929
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:38,719
so it's not a clean

1930
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:40,480
cut there's no clean cut way of

1931
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:42,639
describing this but often what happens

1932
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:44,400
is that the breach coach will actually

1933
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,679
hire the vendor

1934
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:47,920
so they will write up the contract sign

1935
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,040
it

1936
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:50,800
and then often another curious thing

1937
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,960
about this ecosystem is there can be

1938
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,560
further subcontracting

1939
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,560
so often the negotiation with a

1940
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,320
ransomware provider will also be

1941
01:34:58,320 --> 01:34:59,520
subcontracted

1942
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:03,199
and sometimes even ransomware payment

1943
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:06,239
okay so i'm super conscious of time

1944
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:09,040
and i think this is an important one

1945
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,159
because it speaks to

1946
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:13,040
so so far we've shown that insurers kind

1947
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:13,679
of control

1948
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:16,400
which ir firm is chosen but there's this

1949
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,080
question how do insurers

1950
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,440
evaluate yeah evaluate the quality of

1951
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:23,600
the work whether things are going well

1952
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:26,320
and again what we see is that breach

1953
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:26,960
coaches

1954
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:30,000
are in the middle of this so the vendor

1955
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
is asked to kind of report to external

1956
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:32,880
counsel

1957
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,480
often informal based on the

1958
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:36,800
investigation and then it's external

1959
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,400
council who feedback to

1960
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:41,280
insurance and this becomes even more

1961
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,159
confusing with

1962
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:45,040
reports so

1963
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,520
following a forensic investigation it's

1964
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,119
often expected that there's a formal

1965
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:50,400
report documenting

1966
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:52,050
what happened now

1967
01:35:52,050 --> 01:35:53,440
[Music]

1968
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,440
most vendors i spoke to said they are

1969
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,119
less likely to

1970
01:35:57,119 --> 01:35:59,840
write that report if they are reporting

1971
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,600
to an external counsel

1972
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:04,159
because as you can imagine if this

1973
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:05,440
report is written

1974
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,840
then yeah it creates litigation risk

1975
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,280
because it could be discovered it could

1976
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:11,119
be brought up in court

1977
01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:13,440
and then also when you speak to insurers

1978
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:14,320
what you find

1979
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,239
is that for instance i spoke to one

1980
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:18,239
major u.s insurer who said they saw

1981
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:20,320
less than 10 percent of the forensics

1982
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,800
reports about the incidents

1983
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,280
for which they paid a claim out so often

1984
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,880
they are paying thousands of dollars

1985
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,639
hundreds of thousands millions even of

1986
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:29,920
dollars in a claim

1987
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,159
and not seeing the forensic report

1988
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:34,320
understanding what the root cause was

1989
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:37,440
so again we see external um cancer at

1990
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:40,320
the center of things

1991
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:43,440
okay um and often that forensics reports

1992
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,520
there was an interesting anecdote i had

1993
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:45,840
from

1994
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:48,960
one investigator who said that they

1995
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:50,800
would share spreadsheets

1996
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,440
that kind of explain which information

1997
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,440
the lawyer or the law firm is interested

1998
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:56,480
in getting

1999
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:57,840
and those would be tailored to the

2000
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,920
lawyer to the law firm or even the

2001
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:01,199
lawyer

2002
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:03,440
um yeah so this is just showing how

2003
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:05,520
central law firms are to incident

2004
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:06,320
response

2005
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:09,920
in this model in this ecosystem

2006
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:12,480
cool so there's not so long left of the

2007
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,880
talk so i'll begin to kind of probe the

2008
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:17,280
forward-looking things

2009
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:20,880
so this slide um understanding the graph

2010
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:21,600
exactly

2011
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,360
isn't so important but essentially what

2012
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,760
we see is on the left hand side

2013
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,400
there is a large majority of fans who

2014
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:30,159
have just one relationship with one

2015
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:31,360
insurer

2016
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:34,719
and then as you go up you find actually

2017
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:38,480
so here the the data points around 19

2018
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:39,280
show that there are

2019
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:41,280
three firms one legal and two

2020
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:42,719
communications firms

2021
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:46,080
who have 19 relationships with of

2022
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:50,400
with the insurers of the 24 we saw

2023
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:53,760
and so yeah we can map this differently

2024
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:56,320
showing the specific firms so maybe you

2025
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:57,840
have worked with some of these firms in

2026
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:59,440
the past but for instance

2027
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:02,400
mullin coughlin they have been listed by

2028
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,280
80

2029
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:06,320
of the insurers in our sample and they

2030
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,000
would claim for instance that they are

2031
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,480
running over a thousand i think they

2032
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:12,400
claim recently to be running thousands

2033
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:13,199
of cases

2034
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:17,600
every year incidents sorry um

2035
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,280
yeah and you see some of the other firms

2036
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:21,520
so these four firms louis brisbow and

2037
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:24,000
mcdonald hopkins and baker hussnetler

2038
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,840
they all run under the breach coach

2039
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:28,239
trademark

2040
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:30,800
and you can also see which forensics

2041
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:31,280
fans

2042
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:34,239
are kind of favored here so a lot of

2043
01:38:34,239 --> 01:38:36,239
these firms are new they kind of emerged

2044
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:37,119
in the last

2045
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:39,679
yeah 10 years and a lot of it is linked

2046
01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:41,520
to cyber insurance so

2047
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:43,679
one of the firms with among the most

2048
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:45,199
listings said that their real

2049
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:46,960
breakthrough as a forensics fan

2050
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:48,960
was they were added to a cyber insurance

2051
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,199
panel in the early years maybe

2052
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:53,760
eight years ago and then they just blew

2053
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,760
up in um

2054
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,920
yeah kind of size and the number of

2055
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,600
incidents they were running

2056
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,679
uh and what you will also notice is the

2057
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:03,360
firms who you would associate with

2058
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:04,080
having

2059
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,000
kind of network monitoring products like

2060
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,320
crowdstrike fly arrive verizon

2061
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:10,719
they actually have among the kind of

2062
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:12,159
yeah they're not so well

2063
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:14,480
represented in this and this reflects a

2064
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,480
reality that many of these firms in the

2065
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:17,600
cyber insurance

2066
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:20,560
breach coach world of instant response

2067
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,159
are responding without having

2068
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:23,280
pre-existing

2069
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:26,480
network and capture technology so they

2070
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,239
have to rely on the lux that

2071
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:31,600
were in place by the um

2072
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,760
that were run by the client so they're

2073
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:36,239
moving in unfamiliar environments

2074
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:38,159
and so yeah these are all considerations

2075
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:40,800
to have

2076
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:43,040
yeah so this is just kind of a short

2077
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:44,639
summary i think

2078
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:47,760
uh point three is probably important

2079
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:51,280
which is that in this ecosystem there's

2080
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:52,000
this feeling

2081
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,159
that there's always a firm offering a

2082
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:55,440
lower price and this

2083
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:58,320
is really a downward pressure on prices

2084
01:39:58,320 --> 01:39:58,800
um

2085
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,480
and some of these firms are venture

2086
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,320
capital firms

2087
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:04,239
running at a loss so it's a very

2088
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:06,000
competitive ecosystem and people are

2089
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,560
competing on price

2090
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:11,600
okay so these are the things that

2091
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,560
are really difficult to analyze as a

2092
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:16,639
researcher so if you have ideas on how

2093
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:18,320
to analyze these things i would love it

2094
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:19,520
if you got in touch

2095
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:21,520
but right now we can kind of only point

2096
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:23,760
to industry reports that provide you

2097
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,440
clues about what's happening with the

2098
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,280
quality of incident response

2099
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,199
because yeah i'm sure even just the

2100
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:30,880
concept of measuring the quality of

2101
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,080
instant response

2102
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:35,119
could produce an entire workshop and

2103
01:40:35,119 --> 01:40:37,040
but what we can see is for instance

2104
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:39,360
baker hustetler report that

2105
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:41,520
investigation costs are falling year on

2106
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:42,480
year

2107
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:45,440
but they also report that in the process

2108
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,320
of doing that

2109
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,320
forensics firms are moving towards

2110
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,639
automated triage scripts and away from

2111
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:53,520
kind of bespoke malware analysis

2112
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,679
um yeah i'm just going to skip this

2113
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:56,880
point one point

2114
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:00,080
that i think is important is

2115
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:02,320
often we think about so here there's a

2116
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,080
picture of a guy in a cheap suit and the

2117
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:04,639
point

2118
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:06,239
that i think is important to make is

2119
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:08,400
that sometimes although we

2120
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:10,800
yeah okay let me make this point well

2121
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:11,760
although we

2122
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:13,920
think cheap suits are always a bad thing

2123
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,520
often they're perfect

2124
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:17,600
for the purpose so for instance if you

2125
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:18,960
work a job like i do

2126
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:21,040
you kind of only really have cheap suits

2127
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:22,320
because you're an academic going to

2128
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,960
conferences and it's not so important

2129
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:28,480
um but the important thing is that

2130
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:31,440
people have the right kind of product or

2131
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:32,159
service

2132
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:35,119
for their purpose so if cyber insurance

2133
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:37,199
has created a lot of cheaper

2134
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:40,080
incident response then that's great

2135
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:41,280
providing

2136
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:45,280
those um firms are responding to the

2137
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:46,480
right incidents

2138
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:48,639
so in some sense maybe the more

2139
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:51,280
expensive ir firms who have

2140
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:53,679
yeah pre-existing network technology

2141
01:41:53,679 --> 01:41:55,920
capture perhaps that is necessary to

2142
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:57,119
respond to

2143
01:41:57,119 --> 01:42:01,920
higher capability um attackers

2144
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,639
okay then yeah i mean the other point

2145
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:06,320
i'd want to make that i could leave you

2146
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:06,880
with

2147
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:08,480
is this saying it's a great saying to

2148
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:10,480
the man with only a hammer every problem

2149
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:11,760
looks like a nail

2150
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:13,360
i think it's pretty clear that breach

2151
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:14,800
coaches and

2152
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:17,920
an external counsel see litigation risk

2153
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:19,119
they are primarily

2154
01:42:19,119 --> 01:42:22,639
interested in mitigating litigation risk

2155
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:25,760
and whereas some incidents are kind of

2156
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:28,239
unrelated to litigation risk so

2157
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:30,000
for instance ransomware is almost

2158
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,600
entirely driven by

2159
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:34,159
technical risk and here we see that from

2160
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:37,119
2018 to 19 there was a 1 000

2161
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:40,159
increase in ransoms paid and

2162
01:42:40,159 --> 01:42:43,199
yeah we have some more points there

2163
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:45,040
but the point i'd really like to leave

2164
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,560
you with this is kind of the

2165
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:49,440
core point of the talk is that law firms

2166
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:49,760
have

2167
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:51,760
ascended to the top of the incident

2168
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:53,440
response hierarchy

2169
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,119
and they've been helped by insurers in

2170
01:42:55,119 --> 01:42:57,840
doing so and that creates a lot of open

2171
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,119
questions that i think

2172
01:42:59,119 --> 01:43:01,520
the first community should be addressing

2173
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:02,159
how does that

2174
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:05,199
impact the quality of our ir

2175
01:43:05,199 --> 01:43:07,840
and how does it change who is doing ir

2176
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:08,800
and then also

2177
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,639
the question that is kind of relevant to

2178
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:11,920
a conference like this

2179
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:14,239
is how will this emerging set of actors

2180
01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:16,159
the forensics firms that i described or

2181
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:17,199
even the breach cuts

2182
01:43:17,199 --> 01:43:18,960
breach coaches how will they be

2183
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:20,719
integrated into the wider incident

2184
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:22,320
response community

2185
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,800
because very few of those firms were

2186
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,639
first members

2187
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:29,199
cool so yeah i know it was a somewhat

2188
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:31,119
provocative talk and i'm sure you have

2189
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:33,040
many comments so yeah i look forward to

2190
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,040
seeing you in their eight bit

2191
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:37,679
q and r few questions and answers rin

2192
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:40,639
thank you very much

2193
01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:44,239
daniel thank you very much for the talk

2194
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:46,159
today uh for those of you who do have

2195
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:47,520
questions for daniel

2196
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,920
please follow him into the work

2197
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,960
adventure he'll be in qa room 2

2198
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:56,880
in just a moment thank you daniel

2199
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:02,480
excellent and we will have barry green

2200
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,320
is going to be joining us next

2201
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,800
talking about dns is under attack the

2202
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,639
miss koreans offensive playbook with a

2203
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:10,480
defensive counter

2204
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,960
barry are you with us yeah i'm right

2205
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:13,840

all righty sir please take it away

2207
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:20,239
okay let's go ahead and

2208
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:21,680
share the appropriate screen

2209
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:24,729
[Music]

2210
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:30,080
and drop in the present mode

2211
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,960
there we go um thank you for everyone

2212
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:33,760
who's um

2213
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:38,480
joining this is the slide showing okay

2214
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:40,639
yes sir you're good to go all right very

2215
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:42,320
good all right so

2216
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:45,360
um this is a session

2217
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:48,560
that is um kind of topical right now

2218
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:50,560
because we're getting a lot of dns

2219
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:51,600
attacks

2220
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,679
that aren't unnecessarily taken down

2221
01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:55,520
organizations so the whole purpose of

2222
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:56,000
this

2223
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,040
uh this kind of session is to get people

2224
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:00,480
to pay attention to something that

2225
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:02,000
people don't pay attention to because

2226
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,920
usually the domain name system

2227
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:05,840
is something everybody relies upon but

2228
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:06,960
then neglects

2229
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:09,280
it's like often an afterthought and a

2230
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:10,080
lot of people

2231
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:13,119
organizations security uh work

2232
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:15,360
um i'm gonna put these up when we get

2233
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:16,159
over to

2234
01:45:16,159 --> 01:45:19,119
the q a session in that chat area i'll

2235
01:45:19,119 --> 01:45:20,639
put these up there also

2236
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:23,119
but i'm putting here so it's recorded

2237
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:24,800
these materials are

2238
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:27,520
open to people to take cut and paste

2239
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:28,159
slides

2240
01:45:28,159 --> 01:45:29,760
use them in your presentations because

2241
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:31,199
the purpose of this is to

2242
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:32,719
put the alert out let everybody know

2243
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:35,280
that there's a threat what is a threat

2244
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:38,480
um we're getting extortionist waves and

2245
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:40,239
the extortionists could be

2246
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:42,560
related towards ddos extortion which we

2247
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:43,280
get these

2248
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:45,440
you know cycle over you know a couple of

2249
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:46,400
times a year you get

2250
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:48,480
new clues to start up we also are

2251
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,159
starting to get them in uh ransomware

2252
01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:50,960
crews

2253
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:53,840
um they are being used to actually poke

2254
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:55,760
at people to say please pay me it's a

2255
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:57,280
whole monetization thing that we know

2256
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:58,960
within the first community

2257
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:02,159
and dns if you if you know

2258
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:03,840
criminal behavior they don't want to

2259
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:06,159
work too hard so if they want to try to

2260
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:08,000
take down an organization with a big dos

2261
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,159
attack why send a big dos attack against

2262
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:12,159
a whole bunch of anti-dos defenses

2263
01:46:12,159 --> 01:46:13,679
when they're sitting there with two name

2264
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:16,000
servers doing the minimal requirements

2265
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:16,480
for

2266
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:18,320
you know having your domain name service

2267
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,320
up there according to rfcs

2268
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:22,560
and map it and take out both of those

2269
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:23,440
name servers

2270
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:24,880
and then the whole organization's down

2271
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:26,000
it doesn't matter how much cloud

2272
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,360
infrastructure they have and things like

2273
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,040
that so this is this is kind of like the

2274
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:29,840
jest of the

2275
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:32,320
risk around here right now we're

2276
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,600
primarily getting these

2277
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:36,480
sort of attacks via the criminal side

2278
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:38,080
they're trying to monetize

2279
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:41,840
but don't um uh neglect that

2280
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,440
a nation-state actor is sitting there

2281
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:45,520
quietly waiting for when nation-state

2282
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:46,320
actors get

2283
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:49,440
get activated and told to do things they

2284
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:51,440
know they know they have mapped out

2285
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:53,280
infrastructure so again

2286
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:55,280
and then um political activists we've

2287
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:56,960
seen this used in the past

2288
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:59,119
you know and then you know he who knows

2289
01:46:59,119 --> 01:47:00,480
whether he a corporate corporate

2290
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:04,320
sort of violation now just as a reminder

2291
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,800
this is our dns system dns system is you

2292
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,320
know there's no such thing as like

2293
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:11,119
dns right what we have is we have

2294
01:47:11,119 --> 01:47:13,199
authoritative architectures we have root

2295
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:14,480
architectures we have

2296
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:16,480
top-level domain architectures we have

2297
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:18,800
dns resolver architectures

2298
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:20,880
and in today's environment we even have

2299
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:22,400
dns architectures inside

2300
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:25,280
homes right and the way things are set

2301
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:25,920
up

2302
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:28,159
yep

2303
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:37,840
yes

2304
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:39,600
not sure what that was perry please

2305
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:41,600
continue well please continue okay thank

2306
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:42,239
you

2307
01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:44,159
all right so um so we have these

2308
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:45,760
different architectures that are

2309
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:48,000
are happening through through throughout

2310
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,600
right so um

2311
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,360
so here we're going to be focusing on

2312
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:53,119
the authoritative infrastructure this is

2313
01:47:53,119 --> 01:47:55,360
the organization that controls your

2314
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:58,639
zones like in my case uh senki.org as an

2315
01:47:58,639 --> 01:47:59,119
example

2316
01:47:59,119 --> 01:48:00,400
right how do you protect that make sure

2317
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:02,960
that that does not go down

2318
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:04,480
so in here what we're going to walk

2319
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,840
through is what the miss screens kind of

2320
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:07,520
know this is kind of like their playbook

2321
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:09,040
this is the sort of different techniques

2322
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:10,159
they're going to use

2323
01:48:10,159 --> 01:48:11,840
and we're going to do this as a shorter

2324
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:13,679
session there's a longer

2325
01:48:13,679 --> 01:48:15,520
set of slides when we point over to the

2326
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:17,679
materials that you can use this shorter

2327
01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:19,199
session slides out of this or you can

2328
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:20,960
use longer sessions to help explain to

2329
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:21,440
your

2330
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:22,719
management and says we need to pay

2331
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:24,560
attention to these sort of things

2332
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:27,679
right um so in their playbook

2333
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:29,520
one of the things that you see out there

2334
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,440
in a lot of people neglect

2335
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:33,760
is the whole spear efficient aspect of

2336
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:34,480
it of going

2337
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:37,040
after how do you control the domain

2338
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:38,639
itself if somebody wanted to go after my

2339
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:40,400
domain senki.org

2340
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,400
they can go out there and try to get my

2341
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,560
credentials to my registrar

2342
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:46,480
and then change everything's around we

2343
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:48,400
saw this um two years ago

2344
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:51,440
2019 with the sea turtle attacks right

2345
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:53,360
um they're not going away this is kind

2346
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:54,639
of like a a very

2347
01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:57,440
potent area of of attack and it's

2348
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:58,320
interesting how

2349
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:01,040
organizations i work with and they get

2350
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:01,920
attacked

2351
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:03,679
and you find out okay who's got the

2352
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:05,280
access to the registrar

2353
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:06,639
and they'll look around inside the

2354
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:08,080
organization and they won't have that

2355
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:08,800
tracked

2356
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:10,639
so this is really important i'll point

2357
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:11,840
point people to a

2358
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:14,800
document that was created of summarizing

2359
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:15,360
and

2360
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:18,480
the different icann recommendations for

2361
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:19,679
how to protect

2362
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:23,599
your access to your registrar right

2363
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:24,960
the other thing that we've seen out

2364
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:28,239
there is registries and registrars and

2365
01:49:28,239 --> 01:49:30,159
the communication mechanisms between the

2366
01:49:30,159 --> 01:49:31,599
two the epp

2367
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:35,040
point is also getting um targeted

2368
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:37,760
and this is something that in the icann

2369
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:38,719
environment

2370
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:40,800
in registry operations the registrars

2371
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,080
are starting to pay attention to

2372
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:44,480
more right so so this is kind of like a

2373
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:46,320
big brute force because it's going after

2374
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:47,199
a big

2375
01:49:47,199 --> 01:49:50,080
you know um instead of going after

2376
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:52,159
senki.org they'll go after the whole

2377
01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:54,639
dot org right sort of uh infrastructure

2378
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:56,800
with it um

2379
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:58,159
the other thing that you can get with

2380
01:49:58,159 --> 01:50:00,480
spearfishing is if you get access and

2381
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:02,560
penetration into the system

2382
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:04,239
you know if somebody breaks into this

2383
01:50:04,239 --> 01:50:06,480
system as um you know looking for

2384
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:07,280
ransomware

2385
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:10,480
you know it's it's uh one of the things

2386
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:12,800
that they can uh logically do is is

2387
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:15,040
laterally move across the organization

2388
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:17,679
gain that privilege access into the um

2389
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:18,480
hidden

2390
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:21,679
primary dns um and then they

2391
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:23,920
are in control of the dns at that point

2392
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:25,760
right so they they have broken into the

2393
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:27,760
system and you could have a ransomware

2394
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:29,520
event where they actually lock down that

2395
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:31,840
system or or knock it down

2396
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:35,440
so these sort of attacks will happen um

2397
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:38,239
the externally visible dns named servers

2398
01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:39,199
get attacked

2399
01:50:39,199 --> 01:50:41,280
and this is where if you have oh i have

2400
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:43,440
two data centers and two name servers

2401
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:46,080
and you you map it out there you know

2402
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:46,639
that that

2403
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:50,159
that infrastructure is vulnerable to

2404
01:50:50,159 --> 01:50:52,159
attack because they're exposed publicly

2405
01:50:52,159 --> 01:50:54,960
but also um if you don't have um if you

2406
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:55,679
haven't put any

2407
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:57,679
thought into how to protect those then

2408
01:50:57,679 --> 01:51:00,239
those those get taken out

2409
01:51:00,239 --> 01:51:02,159
then you can say okay let's move

2410
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:04,239
upstream you get a lot of our

2411
01:51:04,239 --> 01:51:05,760
different vendors who say hey put a

2412
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:07,840
firewall in front of your dns

2413
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:10,239
okay well firewall get attacked or here

2414
01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:12,000
i do access lists on the router and the

2415
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,440
router gets attacked

2416
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:15,360
um when they see the name servers on the

2417
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:17,040
internet they can trace her out and they

2418
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:19,199
can find here are the different devices

2419
01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:20,800
that are supporting those

2420
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:23,840
externally visible authoritative dns and

2421
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:24,800
those become

2422
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:27,920
a target of attack also that's something

2423
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:28,639
that um

2424
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:30,639
organizations kind of like neglect like

2425
01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:31,920
sometimes you'll have

2426
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:33,360
big infrastructure instead of the data

2427
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:34,480
center you think you have plenty of

2428
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:36,880
bandwidth for your secondary dns

2429
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:39,679
but then um the the path into it gets

2430
01:51:39,679 --> 01:51:41,760
saturated volumetric attack

2431
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:45,360
and it goes down too right so the other

2432
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:46,960
interesting thing that happens is you

2433
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:49,760
get these um reflections off of valid

2434
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:51,040
clients

2435
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:53,119
a lot of times most uh the the

2436
01:51:53,119 --> 01:51:55,280
miscreants will use the easy path like

2437
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:56,480
today they use

2438
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:59,119
open dns reflectors and different parts

2439
01:51:59,119 --> 01:52:00,719
of the internet that reflect the attacks

2440
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:02,000
off and it's very easy

2441
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,400
to do because we're just have a tough

2442
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:06,400
time across the entire internet trying

2443
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,760
to close up these open

2444
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:10,480
uh resolvers right but the other attack

2445
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:12,159
factor that people would do

2446
01:52:12,159 --> 01:52:14,320
the miscreants is they'll use like

2447
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:16,400
inside of a service provider to use

2448
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:18,880
all the different homes i mean you know

2449
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:19,599
in the

2450
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:21,679
the world of broadband those are those

2451
01:52:21,679 --> 01:52:23,040
are high bandwidth i mean it's

2452
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,119
interesting homes today have equivalent

2453
01:52:25,119 --> 01:52:25,920
of bandwidth

2454
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:28,000
and network technology deployed in the

2455
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,679
home equivalent to

2456
01:52:29,679 --> 01:52:32,080
big businesses back in you know the late

2457
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:33,280
90s right there

2458
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:36,080
there it's it's you know that is all

2459
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:37,679
abusable infrastructure

2460
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:39,199
so you'll get things like for instance

2461
01:52:39,199 --> 01:52:41,840
um a common attack factor is a

2462
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:44,239
pseudo-random domain attack and the

2463
01:52:44,239 --> 01:52:45,119
pseudo-random

2464
01:52:45,119 --> 01:52:47,280
domain attack is a miscreant is actually

2465
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:48,560
reflecting

2466
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:51,840
uh zone or uh dns queries

2467
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:55,119
off of like cpes inside the inside of a

2468
01:52:55,119 --> 01:52:56,239
broadband network

2469
01:52:56,239 --> 01:52:59,840
right so you'll your dns res um your dns

2470
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:01,360
infrastructure is say well this is valid

2471
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:01,920
clients

2472
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:03,199
is it valid clients or not fellow

2473
01:53:03,199 --> 01:53:05,440
clients why is why is this particular

2474
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:06,639
home sending me

2475
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:08,800
you know 100 queries per second on dns

2476
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:11,040
right and then you end up having a

2477
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:12,719
collateral because you go out there and

2478
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:14,159
you'll have a throttle

2479
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:15,920
and the throttle will then knock down

2480
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:17,520
the ability of the customer

2481
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:19,599
right to uh to do things so you then you

2482
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:21,599
get this this complicated attack factor

2483
01:53:21,599 --> 01:53:24,000
where two victimization with it

2484
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,760
so when you look at it this is kind of

2485
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,199
like the the crux

2486
01:53:27,199 --> 01:53:29,760
of our problem out there um is that

2487
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:31,040
there's a range of different attack

2488
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:32,639
vectors the missed cranes can map out

2489
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:34,080
the network and do it

2490
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:35,520
so what we're trying to do is get people

2491
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:37,119
to do a wake-up call

2492
01:53:37,119 --> 01:53:40,000
um this is kind of like an old like

2493
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,199
seven habits of highly effective

2494
01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:42,719
assignment criminals if you haven't seen

2495
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:44,400
it there's a link in here i'll share the

2496
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,960
link in the in the breakout q a part

2497
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:49,119
uh this is something that 20 over 20

2498
01:53:49,119 --> 01:53:50,960
years ago rob thomas from team cumbria

2499
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:51,520
and i

2500
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:52,880
were playing around and we started

2501
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:54,320
looking at different criminal behavior

2502
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:56,000
patterns and this is the monetization

2503
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:56,960
cycle

2504
01:53:56,960 --> 01:54:00,239
and the idea here is with your dns

2505
01:54:00,239 --> 01:54:03,360
uh resiliency is to make it where the

2506
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:06,800
bad guys have to work hard right now

2507
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:08,560
the problem we have in industry is they

2508
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:10,239
don't have to work hard

2509
01:54:10,239 --> 01:54:12,639
to cause a lot of damage to the dns

2510
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:13,440
infrastructure

2511
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:16,320
of our organization to do bigger damage

2512
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:17,040
right

2513
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:18,960
and so our goal is to go through and

2514
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:21,280
find ways to actually make it harder for

2515
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:22,960
them because if you make it harder for

2516
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:24,560
them they'll move on to some other

2517
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:26,080
attack factor that's easier

2518
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:27,679
right it's kind of like what's their

2519
01:54:27,679 --> 01:54:29,360
monetization path with it

2520
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:32,080
so from a resiliency standpoint always

2521
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:33,199
want to try to make things

2522
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:35,520
work make the bad guys work harder think

2523
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:37,520
of what you're trying to defend against

2524
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:39,360
you're not defending against uh packets

2525
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:40,719
you're defending against the perfect

2526
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:42,960
people who are pushing out the packets

2527
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:46,480
right um so so um you know the intent is

2528
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:49,119
purpose there so you know the three

2529
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:51,040
power recommended actions you know

2530
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:53,679
number one don't forget dns that our

2531
01:54:53,679 --> 01:54:55,599
number one problem with dns resiliency

2532
01:54:55,599 --> 01:54:56,480
is people

2533
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:58,880
you know have an afterthought um it's

2534
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:00,159
it's like neglected

2535
01:55:00,159 --> 01:55:02,800
it's like who's your dns people who take

2536
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:04,719
care of adinas oh

2537
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:06,000
and then they think think think and they

2538
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,760
have to think of who's actually managing

2539
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:10,960
their their dns systems right so

2540
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:12,880
so um and the people who are managing

2541
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:14,480
dns systems they're usually jumping up

2542
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:15,599
and down and says can i get

2543
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:18,080
can i get resources to do things and

2544
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:19,440
they go no no we have more important

2545
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:20,560
things to do

2546
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:22,239
and then you're gonna you get an attack

2547
01:55:22,239 --> 01:55:23,599
they hit the dns and then everybody

2548
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:25,360
complains that the dns person didn't do

2549
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:26,480
anything

2550
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:28,239
that's that's a situation we just need

2551
01:55:28,239 --> 01:55:29,679
to get out of that's that's the number

2552
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:31,360
one problem of dns resiliency

2553
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:33,119
is it's it's an afterthought and the

2554
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:34,800
people who are doing it are not getting

2555
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:36,239
the help they need to do

2556
01:55:36,239 --> 01:55:38,639
right so so the periodic review look at

2557
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:40,719
what you have make sure you have all the

2558
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:43,040
the passwords infrastructure things like

2559
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:44,080
that

2560
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:47,280
um number two is turn your dns into

2561
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:49,920
a good you know on the resolver side

2562
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:51,760
turn it into a security tool this

2563
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:53,280
this is a different talk to go into

2564
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:55,599
there but one of the most effective

2565
01:55:55,599 --> 01:55:58,080
tools for helping to protect not only

2566
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:00,000
your organization but also keep an eye

2567
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,760
on what sort of miscreant activities

2568
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:03,119
could be poking at your

2569
01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:05,360
overall dns architecture resolver and

2570
01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:06,239
authoritative

2571
01:56:06,239 --> 01:56:09,119
is you know uh you know thinking of dns

2572
01:56:09,119 --> 01:56:09,440
as

2573
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:12,880
a major element in your security uh

2574
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:16,000
uh um topology um

2575
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,880
and the last one related with this um

2576
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:20,719
the days where you had

2577
01:56:20,719 --> 01:56:23,440
you know uh two name servers inside of

2578
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:25,440
uh behind a t1 connection

2579
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:28,800
in your data center those are over um

2580
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:32,639
it's uh we live in a hybrid architecture

2581
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:35,360
which is mixed with cloud and edge and

2582
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:37,679
different topology networks and

2583
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:40,560
globalization and things like that um

2584
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:42,239
you know the place in

2585
01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:44,719
in somebody like myself who's been doing

2586
01:56:44,719 --> 01:56:45,280
this for

2587
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:47,520
for for decades a place of putting your

2588
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:49,280
authoritative dns that's exposed

2589
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:50,960
publicly to the internet it's someplace

2590
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:53,040
in one of the cloud services out there

2591
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:54,880
there are plenty of cloud services out

2592
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,400
there that you can actually leverage

2593
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,960
and use at your price range of what you

2594
01:56:58,960 --> 01:56:59,520
need

2595
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:01,119
you can go out there and search around

2596
01:57:01,119 --> 01:57:02,560
for them um

2597
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:04,800
and and two goods out there and take

2598
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:06,639
basically your secondary dns

2599
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:07,920
infrastructure and

2600
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:10,000
get it up onto the cloud because once

2601
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
you do that you just made it harder for

2602
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,520
the attacker to go after your

2603
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,119
authoritative dns

2604
01:57:15,119 --> 01:57:17,280
then you take your authoritative dns and

2605
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:18,400
stick it you know

2606
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:20,080
you you move that also to the cloud

2607
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:21,679
depend on your organization or you can

2608
01:57:21,679 --> 01:57:23,199
do what a lot of organizations do they

2609
01:57:23,199 --> 01:57:24,320
just turn it into

2610
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:26,960
a hidden primary they you know pack

2611
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:28,159
security around it

2612
01:57:28,159 --> 01:57:29,520
they protect it to make sure people

2613
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:31,360
can't get access to the zones

2614
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:33,360
um if they want to do dns and things

2615
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:34,800
like that they can plug you know

2616
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:37,119
your your key management system to it

2617
01:57:37,119 --> 01:57:38,639
and they put it and protect it

2618
01:57:38,639 --> 01:57:41,440
that right there you know um makes a

2619
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:42,800
huge difference like in

2620
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:46,800
q4 of 2020 we had a bugos extortion

2621
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:49,760
uh racket going around the industry and

2622
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:51,360
it's interesting as you watch their

2623
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:52,480
behavior

2624
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:54,960
um they would poke at dns right so they

2625
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:55,920
attack it

2626
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:57,360
then they they come back and try to

2627
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:59,040
attack it again after they move up to

2628
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:00,400
the cloud and they move on

2629
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:02,400
they just move on to a different target

2630
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:03,840
don't work too hard

2631
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:06,000
right and so that is a major element to

2632
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,239
make sure they work don't work too hard

2633
01:58:08,239 --> 01:58:10,719
the other aspect if you go back to 2019

2634
01:58:10,719 --> 01:58:11,840
and sea turtle

2635
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:13,840
is all the different things to make sure

2636
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:16,080
between you and your registrar

2637
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:19,280
is taken care of right it's it's amazing

2638
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:20,880
how um

2639
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:23,599
you know in doing reviews and i'll get

2640
01:58:23,599 --> 01:58:25,360
on with different organizations and say

2641
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:26,800
let's do a review of your dns

2642
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:28,239
authoritative infrastructure

2643
01:58:28,239 --> 01:58:29,840
let's start talking about your registrar

2644
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:31,520
access and they haven't done any of

2645
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:32,480
these stuff

2646
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:34,080
it's in somebody's personal email box

2647
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:36,159
and sometimes uh the person who used to

2648
01:58:36,159 --> 01:58:37,599
have the registrar access left the

2649
01:58:37,599 --> 01:58:38,480
company

2650
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:39,920
and they have to do a recovery of a

2651
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:41,760
registrar which is not an easy thing to

2652
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:43,119
do sometimes

2653
01:58:43,119 --> 01:58:45,199
right um or they have to reinstate the

2654
01:58:45,199 --> 01:58:46,320
person who left

2655
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:48,320
email address to be able to actually

2656
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,480
change the information on the registrar

2657
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:52,400
don't let that happen to you there are

2658
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:54,320
guidelines that were written up

2659
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:56,480
in icann there are good guidelines in in

2660
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:58,159
us nist

2661
01:58:58,159 --> 01:59:00,320
the problem is they were very convoluted

2662
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:02,000
so what happened is a bunch of

2663
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,400
us um in in akamai we kind of like

2664
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:05,920
summarized everything so we put this

2665
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:07,760
together as an industry write paper

2666
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:09,599
and many organizations cut and paste

2667
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:11,280
with our permission to use this it's

2668
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:12,880
kind of like a summarization of

2669
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:14,719
step one step two step three covering

2670
01:59:14,719 --> 01:59:15,920
these sort of things so it's a good

2671
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:17,360
thing to kind of look at

2672
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:20,000
and add to you know um every at least

2673
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:21,760
once a year if not twice a year just

2674
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:23,040
kind of go through the list and make

2675
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:24,000
sure everything

2676
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,760
between your authoritative dns and the

2677
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:27,040
registrar is

2678
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:29,199
following these sort of best practice

2679
01:59:29,199 --> 01:59:31,360
checklists that are listed out by

2680
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:34,800
icann and other organizations with it um

2681
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:36,880
some people would say oh with everything

2682
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:38,719
you're talking about what about dns sec

2683
01:59:38,719 --> 01:59:41,280
what's interesting about dns sec is you

2684
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:42,719
know dnsec was like

2685
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:44,159
is it worth it or not worth it is it

2686
01:59:44,159 --> 01:59:45,840
worth it is it not worth it over the

2687
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:46,560
years

2688
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:48,159
what's going on right now as we move

2689
01:59:48,159 --> 01:59:51,360
down a dns encryption path

2690
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:53,199
and we're getting the visibility to more

2691
01:59:53,199 --> 01:59:55,199
dns resolvers who are doing

2692
01:59:55,199 --> 01:59:58,560
dns uh sec validation um it's starting

2693
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:01,040
to become where it's a useful tool

2694
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:02,960
right where actually deploying it and

2695
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:04,560
the cost of deploying it

2696
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,080
means you're going to get a return on

2697
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:07,760
the investment of deployment

2698
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:10,159
and that was the problem with dns sec is

2699
02:00:10,159 --> 02:00:12,080
the effort going to be worth

2700
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:14,480
the benefits there's always been the the

2701
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:16,159
problem over the last you know

2702
02:00:16,159 --> 02:00:19,599
decade plus of dns sex existence

2703
02:00:19,599 --> 02:00:21,280
we're now getting to a point where it is

2704
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:23,040
becoming valid

2705
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:25,920
good resource out there so um it's

2706
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:27,040
something to

2707
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:28,239
you know take care of everything else

2708
02:00:28,239 --> 02:00:30,400
for dns resiliency and then circle back

2709
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:31,599
around the dns sec

2710
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:33,040
it's it's actually something to kind of

2711
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:34,480
look at with a different range of

2712
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:36,239
attacks not on your authoritative

2713
02:00:36,239 --> 02:00:39,199
but on the resolver side you know so um

2714
02:00:39,199 --> 02:00:40,880
so that's something to pay

2715
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:44,560
pay attention to so um now

2716
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:47,440
since this is related to dos and venus

2717
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:48,400
resiliency

2718
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:50,239
there are some papers out here in this

2719
02:00:50,239 --> 02:00:52,000
presentation when you download

2720
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,560
that can help you as as good checklist

2721
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:56,400
of like am i doing the right things to

2722
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:57,760
prepare for attack

2723
02:00:57,760 --> 02:01:00,880
each one of these include check your dns

2724
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:03,040
right so what's interesting there is you

2725
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:04,480
know if you go to the

2726
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:07,520
uk ncsc or you go to the nest or you go

2727
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:09,840
to australian cyber security center

2728
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:11,840
or you got some of the the work that i

2729
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:13,440
did on behalf of bdos

2730
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:16,480
um uh working groups um

2731
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:19,679
uh that you'll find that bns is right in

2732
02:01:19,679 --> 02:01:20,480
the middle of it

2733
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:23,840
right yeah um so so um you know

2734
02:01:23,840 --> 02:01:25,520
these are things that if when you pull

2735
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:26,960
down the presentation

2736
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:29,040
look through them these are good guides

2737
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:30,000
that help you

2738
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,119
build overall ddos resiliency

2739
02:01:33,119 --> 02:01:34,800
and dns is one of the first things you

2740
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:36,880
take care of with the authoritative dns

2741
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:37,679
part

2742
02:01:37,679 --> 02:01:39,679
if you're gonna walk through like you

2743
02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:41,440
gotta pick the priorities ones these are

2744
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:42,159
the ones i

2745
02:01:42,159 --> 02:01:43,920
send out the organizations do these

2746
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:45,199
first where

2747
02:01:45,199 --> 02:01:47,199
um number one is you go through like 10

2748
02:01:47,199 --> 02:01:48,480
steps to prepare

2749
02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:50,080
you know for the pain if you know you're

2750
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:51,360
going to get hit with a dos attack

2751
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:52,639
here's the thing just to do

2752
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:54,239
priority there's a lot of things you

2753
02:01:54,239 --> 02:01:55,920
need to do but here's the 10 things to

2754
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:57,040
do a priority

2755
02:01:57,040 --> 02:01:58,960
and then um then you have critical

2756
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:00,960
security conversations because

2757
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:04,000
vdos isn't protected by yourself

2758
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,679
you know if you're under threat of a dos

2759
02:02:05,679 --> 02:02:07,840
attack it's a community response

2760
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:10,880
plan like but first it's a community

2761
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:12,000
response plan

2762
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,080
so you'll you know those of peop

2763
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:15,520
everybody here who's part of the first

2764
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:16,880
community will see these seven

2765
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:19,199
critical security conversations as very

2766
02:02:19,199 --> 02:02:20,000
normal from

2767
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,679
from what we do in our community as

2768
02:02:21,679 --> 02:02:23,520
hints and responders

2769
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:26,800
um the materials as i mentioned are

2770
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:29,920
all public um if you can't find it just

2771
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:31,760
remember senki.org i take all my

2772
02:02:31,760 --> 02:02:32,880
materials i present

2773
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:36,159
you know wherever i'm at i put copies of

2774
02:02:36,159 --> 02:02:37,920
it up there so you can find it up there

2775
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:41,040
you've got my email addresses on that um

2776
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:43,679
and then i'll read i'll put these also

2777
02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:44,320
into the

2778
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:47,440
area in the q a section and since i had

2779
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:49,199
a couple extra minutes here

2780
02:02:49,199 --> 02:02:50,800
i wanted to make sure people kind of

2781
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:52,400
understood these seven seven

2782
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:55,360
monetization factors and related to dns

2783
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:58,159
um and why you know it's interesting to

2784
02:02:58,159 --> 02:03:00,080
kind of circle back around to see how

2785
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:02,080
these the seven habits applies to

2786
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:04,480
authoritative dns

2787
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:06,800
you know they can what you know so

2788
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:08,719
principal number one misgrants

2789
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:10,960
if i'm a criminal i want to you know

2790
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:12,800
make money pray criminal activities

2791
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:15,199
not get caught that's rule number one if

2792
02:03:15,199 --> 02:03:17,119
they if they do an attack and there's a

2793
02:03:17,119 --> 02:03:18,880
chance of tracing back to them

2794
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:21,040
to find them and put handcuffs on them

2795
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:22,880
uh they're not going to do it

2796
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:24,880
the thing with authoritative dns is it's

2797
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:27,199
so easy to put like dns reflectors

2798
02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:29,119
fire up a stressor or booter and whack

2799
02:03:29,119 --> 02:03:30,880
the authoritative infrastructure because

2800
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:32,400
you can find it

2801
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:34,400
they don't get caught so it's a that's

2802
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:36,880
why it's a popular sort of

2803
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:39,119
tool in their arsenal to go after

2804
02:03:39,119 --> 02:03:40,080
organization

2805
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:41,520
they also don't have to work too hard

2806
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:43,679
because if an organization hasn't done

2807
02:03:43,679 --> 02:03:46,560
any sort of thought on bns resiliency or

2808
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:48,000
they did things like oh let's stick a

2809
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,280
firewall in front of it and make it

2810
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:51,360
easier to take out because i can do a

2811
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:53,840
attack against the firewall itself um

2812
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:54,719
then

2813
02:03:54,719 --> 02:03:57,199
they you know you you don't have to work

2814
02:03:57,199 --> 02:03:58,320
too hard

2815
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:02,320
um it's interesting pool because we see

2816
02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:04,400
it now with the ddos extortion

2817
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:08,400
um pay medias bitcoins or else

2818
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:10,639
whack you get hit with a ddos against

2819
02:04:10,639 --> 02:04:12,480
the dns infrastructure right

2820
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:14,239
so they they can make money off of it so

2821
02:04:14,239 --> 02:04:15,599
they they'll follow the money they can

2822
02:04:15,599 --> 02:04:17,679
do it now bitcoin the bitcoin

2823
02:04:17,679 --> 02:04:20,000
um you know has made monetization of

2824
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,760
criminal activities uh easier

2825
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:24,320
easier for them um they will move up the

2826
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:24,960
screen

2827
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:26,960
otherwise if if you think that you can

2828
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:29,360
like have big data center resources to

2829
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:31,040
protect your dos attack or stick them

2830
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:32,000
all behind

2831
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,800
you know dos defenses they'll move up

2832
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:36,560
because they can trace route into

2833
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:38,400
the name server and they can find out

2834
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:39,679
which router to tack

2835
02:04:39,679 --> 02:04:42,000
into so that is your couple dependencies

2836
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,440
and of course they'll tack from all over

2837
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:44,480
the internet

2838
02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:47,920
and you know all the other sort of

2839
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:51,360
factors with it so that is um

2840
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:54,400
kind of like a little jest with it um so

2841
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:56,960
um i'm looking forward to q and a's that

2842
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,840
people have

2843
02:04:57,840 --> 02:04:59,599
uh come on over with it if you have

2844
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:00,960
questions also

2845
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:03,760
and here's our little chat room there so

2846
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:04,800
i'll i'll be there

2847
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:06,960
waiting around i'll drop things into the

2848
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:08,480
chat so people can you know

2849
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:10,719
explore the different links and then

2850
02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:12,159

directly because a lot of times

2853
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:18,159
in security space we all know that you

2854
02:05:18,159 --> 02:05:20,320
don't want to ask questions publicly

2855

um we go one-on-one um i'm also on the

2856
02:05:23,119 --> 02:05:24,400
