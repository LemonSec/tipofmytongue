such as the remote instead hundreds

176
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,920
and question two what kind of measure

177
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,440
have you prepared for terror as part of

178
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,760
your bcp and work style reforms

179
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,480
are several sections such as the

180
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,440
developing

181
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,399
development of system or teamwork

182
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,680
establishment

183
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,040
obligation for network user guide

184
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,839
such as and all there are two

185
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,320
she's a specific question instead

186
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,760
response procedure

187
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,040
assuming two work and exercise

188
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,279
and training assuming tail works

189
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,680
many of bcps

190
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,040
all over the organization are prepared

191
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,000
and uh more than 60 percent of companies

192
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,200
made the user guide and

193
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,600
some are the tailwork systems but

194
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,120
about on the remote to incident hundreds

195
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,399
are only 10 percent and exercise and

196
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,600
training assuming

197
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,720
to work is only the five percent

198
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,519
is prepared

199
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,079
we are still in process to preparing

200
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,279
for scissors activities for their work

201
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,000
environment

202
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,360
question three how did the seas are

203
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,160
created

204
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,720
under the declaration of emergency take

205
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,120
place

206
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,399
it's also more than 90 percent con

207
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,880
companies implemented trail work systems

208
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,560
but in about unscathed activities

209
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,240
in some cases emergent on site

210
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,600
on site response unnecessary

211
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,680
and um it is

212
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,560
difficult to use a via internet some

213
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,160
tools

214
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,360
so the system member

215
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,720
may have to go to their office or

216
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,640
stay in the office so it is

217
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,760
if you difficult to

218
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,519
shift it one hundred percent term work

219
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,800
so it can be said that incident

220
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,440
detection and instant response better

221
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,600
based on

222
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,240
the prevention of new converse infection

223
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,800
is

224
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,959
urgent issue to be considered

225
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,240
the result of the survey can be

226
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,680
summarized as

227
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,720
follows although we had prepared

228
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,160
a trade work environment we had not

229
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,440
anticipated such a rapid transition

230
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,040
and additional measures became

231
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,959
necessary she said also did not

232
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,000
make sufficient measures about

233
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,920
remote incident hundreds and physical

234
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,240
prevention

235
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,600
of real virus infections

236
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,200
there are many issues to consider and

237
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,200
just play these are spread across

238
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,920
the wide range of field such as

239
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,480
the some ict and network tech

240
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,440
technologies

241
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,519
and uh some of our preparing for uh

242
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,560
uninfected surprise and uh

243
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,560
some of the

244
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,680
skilled person rotation schedule

245
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,040
and some of our

246
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,599
exploration to effect some probation

247
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,680
department

248
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,079
we know there are no perfect answers

249
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,320
but we thought

250
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,600
these issues needed to be sorted out

251
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,040
as soon as possible

252
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,200
do you think job general bcp and general

253
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,560
physical shift measures prepared by

254
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,839
the whole organization

255
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,880
will make the research specific

256
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,000
activities safe we think

257
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,079
it is insufficient for seizures

258
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,200
with the entire organization have to

259
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,160
have member safety and business

260
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,839
continuity plans

261
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,920
and then add such specific

262
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,639
safety measures and business continuity

263
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,040
plans

264
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,880
so we decided to organize the issue

265
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,360
in the community collected example to

266
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,160
measure

267
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,199
and share them

268
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,040
and we planned the first version of

269
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,240
the document correcting on the issues

270
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,959
and collecting

271
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,560
on the measures in two months

272
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,680
because this problem was an

273
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,360
urgent issue for us although

274
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,839
there may be bias in adequate

275
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,120
we chose to create it

276
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,760
quickly and improve it

277
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,279
as necessary we also decided

278
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,600
to conduct all meetings remotely and

279
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,639
share and operate this document

280
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,839
in the cloud it was also our first

281
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,760
attempt

282
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,519
let me digress for a moment during

283
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,680
the 6th great east japan earthquake in

284
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,959
20 lives we explain

285
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,720
experienced various different

286
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,120
difficulties in our scissors

287
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,800
activities in addition after the

288
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,040
earthquake we had to deal with a lot of

289
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,680
broad emails so we recognize george

290
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,480
the importance of sea salt increase

291
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,120
after

292
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,839
natural disaster so we hope

293
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,880
this experience she said under

294
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,560
restricted activity

295
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,920
will be documented and use other

296
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,560
difference for future sensors members

297
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,120
we will presented

298
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,560
an overview of the document and how to

299
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,759
make it

300
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,959
first of all we correctly specific

301
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,320
issues for c such activities under

302
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,880
the first declaration of emergencies

303
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,160
some of them are as follows

304
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,519
inability of secure service secure

305
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,759
sufficient workforce

306
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,120
insufficient communications inability to

307
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,920
use

308
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,079
the tool remotely

309
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,519
there are no recovery plans when

310
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,680
an incident infection occurs

311
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,639
in monitoring rooms there are no

312
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,839
procedure

313
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,360
to be taken when incident hunter far

314
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,959
find a person who isn't in good physical

315
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,839
condition

316
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,040
from these issues

317
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,959
we decided to focus on the two

318
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,920
point one ensuring the physical safety

319
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,959
of the members two

320
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,959
to organize bcp for seaside

321
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,720
activities under the infection

322
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,839
prevention situation

323
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,079
let me digress for a moment again

324
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,359
this restoration describe how to ensure

325
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,319
safety

326
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,839
in the event of tsunami

327
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,400
i improved the bcm of my season

328
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,520
after the great east japan earthquake in

329
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,840
2011 it includes

330
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,960
power supply moving the office to the

331
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,240
new location

332
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,480
in case the office could not be used

333
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,840
due to the earthquake and

334
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,799
relocating several servers to the safe

335
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,360
robust

336
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,440
buildings however

337
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,480
this time these measures were

338
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:01,840
useless to help our new problems

339
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,520
then we organize up

340
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,960
polishes the top priority

341
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,000
is to ensure the physical safety of

342
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,760
seaside members

343
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,880
then we consider the following

344
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,039
first making a list of system activities

345
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,640
that should be continued

346
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,360
the list of seaside activity that should

347
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,559
be

348
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,600
continued depend on organization and

349
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,360
its situations

350
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,120
but list of

351
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,799
exhaustive system activities helps many

352
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,840
seasons

353
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,760
when they consider the problems

354
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,600
second season activities

355
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,960
that can be performed remotely

356
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,960
are shifted to remote tasks

357
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,840
secure remote connections should be

358
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,880
built and

359
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,080
maintained to for this purpose some

360
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,720
tools

361
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,400
may not be able to be connected via

362
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,520
the internet in such cases

363
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,600
consider alternative safety measures

364
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,039
such as planning or working location

365
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,840
rotation and build a sufficient

366
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,440
valuation for

367
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,200
operational rooms third

368
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,480
checking and reboot rebuilding the

369
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,640
communication system among seaside

370
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,520
members

371
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,120
and related department creating a

372
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,640
communication systems that take include

373
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,360
account the mixed environment of

374
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,080
telework

375
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,200
and office work and inspect

376
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,960
inspect whether the system work actually

377
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,039
or not

378
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,160
first making an escalation

379
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,559
procedure to the infection probation

380
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,880
department

381
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,400
she that member could be the first

382
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,919
to find an employee who is not in good

383
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,240
health

384
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,200
six minutes remaining eg yes thank you

385
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,840
yeah

386
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,120
this job is a list of suicide activities

387
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,159
that should be considered for physical

388
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,520
safety

389
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,960
work method and secret

390
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,799
assumption under activity restriction

391
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,679
items are taken from cesar service frame

392
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,159
work

393
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,320
and ship street she said service

394
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,679
framework is a

395
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,960
list of seaside activities

396
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,880
organ organized by first

397
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,039
and a sims 3 is a maturity model for

398
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,559
seaside management

399
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,960
created by domestic food ocf

400
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,600
from the css subs services framework

401
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,880
all five service categories are

402
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,280
selected and from sims 3 the item

403
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,400
that should be inspected under

404
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,840
a pandemic are selected

405
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,720
we've created this list to be as

406
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,559
comprehensive as possible

407
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,120
after this page we use event management

408
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,400
as a

409
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,440
monitoring and instant detection this is

410
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,080
because

411
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,120
i want to use the term

412
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,440
according to the first service

413
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,880
frameworks

414
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,120
this table shows the structure of

415
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,360
document we have created

416
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,280
these first two selections

417
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,159
are assumed issued and there are

418
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,600
examples

419
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,640
the next one is

420
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,320
selection divided activity into

421
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,039
the two conditions remote and on-site

422
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,799
and the next two each selection

423
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,080
is solution of polishes and specific

424
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,120
examples and the last one

425
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,720
is the item that should be

426
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,000
organized not by scissors but

427
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,120
by entire organization such as company

428
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,158
or universities

429
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,440
possible issues section is a

430
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,000
list of issues that have been

431
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,280
experienced

432
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,320
or are anticipated by

433
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,559
members of these activities

434
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,280
i really think these risks will be

435
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,080
helpful

436
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,720
when considering safety measures or

437
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,240
other effects

438
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:08,480
just disease and bcp for scissors

439
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,960
the next one is example of possible

440
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,080
issues

441
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,320
the next see the possible issues may be

442
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,679
obstructed and unclear so

443
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,960
this may be difficult to use

444
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,440
to consider we hope

445
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,039
so please refer to these examples

446
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,159
and think about what might

447
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,640
happen in your own teams

448
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,720
and next is a direction observations

449
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,480
in this section the portion is described

450
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,520
this section is also abstracted too

451
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,720
but thanks to the abstraction we see

452
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,520
it's broadly applicable

453
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,559
and next is on social and specific

454
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,799
examples there are four categories

455
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,039
big two is safety perspective and

456
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,120
business quantity specifically

457
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,240
and each of these divided for a

458
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,159
remote work and on-site work

459
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,480
and the last one is

460
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,600
organizational preparation

461
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,640
it is not considered not for

462
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,039
us but for the whole organization

463
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,320
these consist of five categories

464
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,919
related workload and

465
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,200
ict and network technologies and

466
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,799
physical environment and facilities and

467
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:56,240
business procedures and bigger systems

468
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,760
and this is on

469
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,000
the questionnaire of uh after the first

470
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,120
emergency declaration we hold at harvard

471
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,159
workshop

472
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,520
in october 2020. participation could

473
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,640
join

474
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,760
is online and on site and in the

475
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,799
question

476
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,000
uh over the sixty percent of seasoned

477
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,880
members

478
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,880
can do work well in the pandemics

479
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,919
but uh the industry is j how's the

480
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:30,480
problem

481
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,600
and the certain is unknown

482
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,360
and um this stress shows which activity

483
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,080
do you do well under the copy 19

484
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,840
pandemics

485
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,559
um only the committee activity are less

486
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,200
than 50 percent

487
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,640
it may be on the lower priority

488
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,240
i think but uh sometimes um the new

489
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,120
commerce is

490
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,080
difficult to make a good relationship to

491
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,360
on

492
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,679
the members remotely so i want to

493
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,720
think consider this problem more and

494
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,200
more

495
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,840
after that

496
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,480
and future activities yeah i

497
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,760
collected a japanese situation but uh

498
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,240
if you could share the situation status

499
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:22,799
from

500
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,279
each country or communities we would

501
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,279
like to organize them

502
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:32,480
and writing down and share you all

503
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,880

with uh excellent feedback on your

513
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,159
questionnaire and how

514
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,799
this should keep up with in dire

515
00:26:58,799 --> 00:26:59,840
conditions

516
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,000
i especially appreciated a few elements

517
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,400
such as dcp aspects

518
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,480
the comments on the need to see of

519
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,760
seizure to adapt and

520
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,640
improve uh with new types of incidents

521
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,320
and the fact that you highlighted the

522
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,640
the safety aspect for seasick members

523
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,960
uh human aspects are often neglected

524
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,399
within t-shirts and it's

525
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,159
although it's an important category for

526
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,760
the symmetry model so

527
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,240
yeah really important and of course i

528

times you know um executives from senior

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,799
executives you know including the chief

information security officer the cso

589
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,440
you know being an organization with ask

590
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,399
you know like

591
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,200
um can you share relevant details of

592
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,320
this current threat

593
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,240
have you confirmed you know how does it

594
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,480
impact us you know what mitigations have

595
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,520
we put in place

596
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,840
uh to protect us from the attack you

597
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,360
know that we are seeing that's impacting

598
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,640
other companies

599
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,559
you know a lot of times the cso asks you

600
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,840
this question because

601
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,320
uh there's concern executives from the

602
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,000
board from the shareholders

603
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,919
uh that may have asked csu about this

604
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,520
and therefore you know

605
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,159
the cso is asking you so that he or she

606
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,919
can provide this answer

607
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,960
to the required stakeholders um another

608
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,360
time

609
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,520
we see is that the regulator you know

610
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,279
could pose the same question

611
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,360
uh you know to a bank you know if you

612
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,399
work in a bank

613
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,520
or a customer could post to a technology

614
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,240
company

615
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,480
uh so in a case like we are in vmware

616
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,159
you know because customers are using

617
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,039
your software

618
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,880
they are concerned you know like you

619
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,159
know can you tell me more about these

620
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,760
threats and attack how what are you

621
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,559
doing to

622
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,960
address this um finally you know of

623
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,880
course as an organization in turn we

624
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,039
also ask our supplier

625
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,760
also our vendors you know like um you

626
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,559
know

627
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,559
what's the data or systems uh that you

628
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,760
have hosted for us

629
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,679
exposing a recent attack that we found

630
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,760
out you know impacting your organization

631
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,440
so this has been a common question

632
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,120
because of the recent supply chain

633
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,000
attacks

634
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,960
and as cyber incidents you know security

635
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,440
incidents

636
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,200
impact companies operations and their

637
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,600
share prices there is a need to answer

638
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,000
all these

639
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,320
questions and this is something that yes

640
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,720
the threat intelligence team can answer

641
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,880
but yet it can also be answered by a

642
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,960
member of the incident response

643
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,799
or the digital forensics or the blue

644
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,559
team and i'll share with you in my

645
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,399
presentation how we can proactively

646
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,080
prepare these answers

647
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,840
uh to these questions so you know see so

648
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,480
um you know threats risks and priorities

649
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,200
prevention

650
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,840
starts with knowing what is relevant you

651
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,399
know

652
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,240
relevant threats that could impact your

653
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,519
organization

654
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,840
the cso the security operations team do

655
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,640
not have time

656
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,559
to read daily threat intelligence

657
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,840
reports from

658
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,799
reliable sources uh or information you

659
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,559
know all these relevant risks should be

660
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,080
brought to their attention

661
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,000
before it affects the company and to

662
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,200
gain their support

663
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,440
for following up mitigations or address

664
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,919
the gaps so these are common threats uh

665
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:40,880
attacks that

666
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,240
cso would has expressed interest in so

667
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,080
what i'll be sharing in this slide

668
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,679
is something that they have commonly

669
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,360
asked for us about

670
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,519
uh it is not exhaustive and you should

671
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,279
customize one such

672
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,519
uh list for your company and for your

673
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,640
csu

674
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,039
for example a security incident with

675
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,279
attack details provided you know

676
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,360
could you share more about it you know

677
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,960
because it has targeted

678
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,799
you know or affected you know various

679
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,039
companies uh they are based in the same

680
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:09,919
country

681
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,399
uh or in the same industry that we are

682
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,799
from so for example if you are a bank

683
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,200
you know and this attack has impacted

684
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,080
another bank

685
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,919
in um you know the country are from for

686
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,120
example in singapore

687
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,519
then it's possible that the uh your

688
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,960
organization will ask you can you

689
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,320
provide more details

690
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,640
about this and you know they would ask

691
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,519
something like

692
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,840
you know because of systems uh that

693
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,960
previously

694
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,600
uh you know your vendor has hosted data

695
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,159
on

696
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,240
has experienced a security incident or a

697
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,919
data breach so they would want more

698
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,600
information about the attack

699
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,320
and more more information about what the

700
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,840
mitigations we have

701
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,240
you know or if there are instances where

702
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,080
you have vulnerable systems

703
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,640
or sorry systems that are previously

704
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,080
infected by malware

705
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,640
attributed to a particular adversary or

706
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,519
threat group

707
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,440
you know this is something that you know

708
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,559
would come of interest to the cso

709
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,360
or any of the vulnerable systems that

710
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,679
are being exploited by adversaries

711
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,039
you know it could be the same type of

712
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,679
systems that are currently being managed

713
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,240
on-premise or on cloud but managed

714
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,000
within your organization and used within

715
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,039
your company

716
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,679
and this kind of risk tends to increase

717
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:20,880
if the systems

718
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,880
are internet-facing and they face

719
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,799
critical vulnerabilities

720
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,200
finally uh one of those areas that of

721
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,480
interest always is

722
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,799
any restricted or confidential data

723
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,279
that's accessible without access control

724
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,200
or has not been approved which means to

725
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,559
say it could be

726
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,440
unknowingly published or it could be

727
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,480
shared but

728
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,120
not approved uh you know to a group of

729
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,919
individuals

730
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,240
hence could result in a data breach so

731
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,399
all these threats that i've listed here

732
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,279
is uh you know in order of frequency

733
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,640
that i've observed

734
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,559
uh the different types of intelligence

735
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,159
reports uh have been

736
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,240
uh you know reported you know whether is

737
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,200
it uh

738
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,600
paid intelligence or open source free

739
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,399
intelligence

740
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,880
but importantly this is a living

741
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,600
document

742
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,880
you know something that should be

743
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,800
created for your organization

744
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,119
uh to mention all the possible threats

745
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,199
uh that could impact your organization

746
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,719
and it's a living document that you

747
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,480
should update to suit your customer

748
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,440
your company's needs this stress also

749
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,079
would impact

750
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,079
your security operations team as they

751
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,560
align to the priorities of the

752
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,719
chief information security officer and

753
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,879
now you know what to look out for

754
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,639
what is the proposed the proposed

755
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,800
delivery method is to conduct a threat

756
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,440
briefing

757
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,159
but before i dive into a thread briefing

758
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,480
what details do you need to provide

759
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,119
you know to in order to prepare for that

760
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,239
first is that

761
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,639
let's have a concise thread analysis set

762
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,560
up so we want to keep the details

763
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,119
short and answer the purpose of the

764
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:49,839
attack

765
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,760
okay you want to keep it short if

766
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,399
possibly you know between 40 to 70 words

767
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,839
you want to explain what is the

768
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,000
operating system what is the application

769
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,440
versions they are affected

770
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,119
what was the data that was compromised

771
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,720
or exfiltrated

772
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,079
what are the specific common

773
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,839
vulnerabilities and exposures

774
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,480
cbe that was exploited in the attack

775
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,240
what is the impact

776
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,560
and possibly what is the impact of the

777
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,160
malware that would have

778
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,520
you know would impact the affected

779
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,920
system now under assessment you want to

780
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,640
include

781
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,800
um how is this relevant to the company

782
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,119
so you want to specify actions you have

783
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:23,760
taken

784
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,359
to verify that uh this attack or this

785
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:27,760
threat

786
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,720
has impact to your environment as impact

787
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,160
to your organization

788
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,560
you have checked that the very affected

789
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,359
systems are

790
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,839
used you have reached out to teams to

791
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:38,720
verify that

792
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,320
so these are details that you can

793
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,320
provide in the assessment

794
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,160
if there were indicators of compromise

795
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,880
provided you can also include uh this

796
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,599
ioc strip that you have done to identify

797
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:50,880
potential impact

798
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,200
now if there are any gaps that would

799
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,560
impact the assessment

800
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,880
or the or you know to verify the impact

801
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,000
of this threat

802
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,240
um you should also indicate the gaps

803
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,599
therefore the sisu

804
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,640
has attention on uh what he needs what

805
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,000
he or she needs to support

806
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,240
what's the action required and as well

807
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,119
as um

808
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,359
if there's any decisions that require uh

809
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,480
the siso to make

810
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,200
uh based on risk you know this is an uh

811
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,560
area that you know you should

812
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,880
also indicate that and finally we'll

813
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,560
touch on the impact

814
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,960
so um what we are interested to know is

815
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,160
what are the possible

816
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,200
attack surfaces infection vectors attack

817
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:27,920
vectors

818
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,920
what other mitigations or preventative

819
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,079
actions that you have applied to address

820
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,240
these same techniques what are the

821
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,320
malware that was used in the attack

822
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,200
that could potentially be deployed in

823
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,960
our company in your company

824
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,599
for example um you know do you want to

825
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,079
block

826
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,160
command and control domains you know

827
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,680
that's on the firewall

828
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,880
um block or monitor uh detection

829
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,040
you know uh processes uh detection of

830
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,800
processes and techniques that's used by

831
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,839
that malware

832
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,240
uh you know by by setting up those use

833
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,119
cases

834
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,599
um alerts on the endpoint detection and

835
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,560
response

836
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,839
so um with that um we want to ensure

837
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,440
that when you present this threat

838
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,800
analysis

839
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,160
you know for a threat briefing it should

840
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,320
be kept to three minutes um

841
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,280
by having a very concise threat analysis

842
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:15,760
um

843
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,520
it reflects that someone within the

844
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,119
information security team is following

845
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,400
up ongoing threats

846
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,160
and even if there are no risks to the

847
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,000
company the cso will want an

848
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,920
update that an action was taken to

849
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,079
verify that that verify that

850
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,359
you know we have checked there's no

851
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,280
impact to us verify that there's no

852
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,040
relevance to our organization so i think

853
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,640
that's a confirmation that

854
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,440
someone needs to do um to ensure or give

855
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,880
assurance to that aspect

856
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,839
now i'd like to give an example um if

857
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,000
darkseid ransomware falls under

858
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,079
the threat priorities risk priorities

859
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,920
that i've mentioned earlier and relevant

860
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,040
to your company

861
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,920
now this example reflects a concise

862
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,560
threat

863
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,160
analysis like what i've mentioned

864
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,560
earlier and i have actually um

865
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,400
you know obtained uh the sources based

866
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,839
on sisa and

867
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,119
fireeye so for example in this case i

868
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,960
will give a very short statement

869
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,280
you know stating um what was what was my

870
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,079
source

871
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,960
what am i looking at and i'm interested

872
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,359
if

873
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,680
for example if you're a u.s based

874
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,400
company

875
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,200
and you are in energy oil and gas now

876
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,960
having this point to state that colonial

877
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,400
pipeline would actually be of interest

878
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,280
to you because

879
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,000
it's probably your partner you know one

880
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,400
of your

881
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,800
competitors and if it has impacted the

882
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,320
organization you'll be interested to

883
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,680
know does it impact you

884
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,280
and because it's such a widespread

885
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,280
activity you'll probably be interested

886
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:35,680
because

887
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,200
it's also based off us if your

888
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
organization is based off there

889
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,400
and the proposed attack was mentioned to

890
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,520
say that it's uh

891
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,079
because of data encryption it's a

892
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,359
ransomware

893
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,839
it also does data explication so these

894
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,920
are information that you want to include

895
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,880
in your summary not too much but enough

896
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,440
to explain what does it do

897
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,280
what are the risks to the organization

898
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,640
to the cso it's a

899
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,200
financial loss if you pay out the ransom

900
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,880
or there's a data breach and you can

901
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,000
receive fines for that

902
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,320
and what was the impacted systems

903
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,119
windows and

904
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,160
linux operating system so

905
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,720
of course what other assessment uh you

906
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,520
could include

907
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,440
you could include what is the relevance

908
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,200
to this attack to your company

909
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,160
so for example if you find that because

910
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,960
you are in uh

911
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,040
based on u.s this was widespread you

912
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,599
could mention that that was the case

913
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,680
and other indicate because of indicators

914
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,280
of compromise was provided

915
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,760
you could indicate that a check was done

916
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,599
based on the indicator sweep there was

917
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,160
no

918
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,000
uh suspicious activity found in the

919
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,520
network logs

920
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,680
and i've not mentioned here but also in

921
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,440
the fire eye report that was mentioned

922
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,760
of this particular cve-20212016

923
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,320
was exploited for initial access so if

924
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,119
this

925
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,280
product sonic wall is being used in your

926
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,880
organization you have a vulnerable

927
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,440
system

928
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,800
you could also mention that you know

929
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,960
when was the patch applied uh so that

930
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,760
you know the

931
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,720
the cso would have a sense of assurance

932
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,560
that at least from that attack vector

933
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,440
uh that has been uh addressed um other

934
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,359
controls you could also mention general

935
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,319
controls

936
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,200
uh you know if this was a tall router uh

937
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,400
if you do not use

938
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,960
the onion router in your environment in

939
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,920
your company

940
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,000
uh you could block uh web traffic to

941
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,040
exit and

942
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,760
entry nodes so that you know that's

943
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,920
another level of general controls

944
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,160
not specific to this attack uh it is

945
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,240
being used but it can also be used by

946
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,200
other uh threat directors uh for other

947
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,160
attacks

948
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,040
now finally um impact so um there was

949
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,440
always

950
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,560
an interest to mention on how does

951
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,119
it impact your organization how does it

952
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,560
impact

953
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,200
your company we would include the

954
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,640
mitigation specific

955
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,359
to the techniques uh that the malware

956
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,960
that used in this attack so

957
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,400
for example um when we refer ransomware

958
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,240
um is it currently being blocked by

959
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,240
policies on your endpoint and detection

960
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,760
and response systems

961
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,960
um is uh the processes uh

962
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,280
you know is there a detection alert that

963
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,520
was created for related processes is it

964
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,440
being monitored by security operations

965
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,000
team

966
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,839
and obviously uh one of the most common

967
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,760
ways is uh do you block those

968
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,319
um file hashes that's being used uh

969
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,079
either on the endpoint detection

970
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,880
or the domain names on the firewalls so

971
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,560
i think that these are typical

972
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,079
um preventative action very specific to

973
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:28,800
that malware

974
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,280
very specific to the activity now cesar

975
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,520
has provided a list of mitigations

976
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,680
that you can deploy that's applicable to

977
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,520
your company i have not

978
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,920
included all of them here because

979
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,280
various organizations

980
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,640
may use different tools for example they

981
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,319
use rdp remote desktop

982
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,400
protocol and you can't actually block

983
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,160
that out right if that's being used

984
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,880
if not why not so that's that kind of

985
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,760
applicability

986
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,720
when you refer to mitigations that you

987
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,359
can put

988
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,839
either in your assessment or your impact

989
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:00,720
now with

990
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,000
a threat analysis this concise analysis

991
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,720
that's done

992
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,920
you want to collate and combine them so

993
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,319
what is the intent now i mentioned about

994
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,760
threat briefing

995
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,920
okay the intent is that you want to

996
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,280
collect this

997
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,720
threat analysis you have done for

998
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,480
different attacks that is of relevance

999
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,839
to your organization

1000
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,599
you want to organize something that's

1001
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,520
weekly or fortnightly

1002
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,440
it depends on your c source preference

1003
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,599
only his on her availability

1004
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,920
you want to keep it to five thread

1005
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,720
analysis

1006
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,720
because you don't want to exceed the

1007
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,640
session to make it too long and

1008
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,040
make it ineffective for your cso you

1009
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,800
want to have an opportunity to

1010
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,599
build a report with your cso to find out

1011
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:42,720
what are the threats

1012
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,040
what are the concerns that you know

1013
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,000
impacts uh

1014
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,560
concerns them subsequently you like to

1015
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,119
address them by looking at um you know

1016
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,400
future uh threats um if they

1017
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,800
come up that addresses those concerns

1018
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,240
that your cso have

1019
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,480
you want to uh provide the updates in

1020
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,240
the similar fashion that we did

1021
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,000
for threat analysis in a concise threat

1022
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,440
analysis fashion

1023
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,480
um this all is

1024
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,359
preferably done either in person or over

1025
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:12,000
video

1026
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,920
because you want to give the csu an

1027
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,000
opportunity to ask questions

1028
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,640
clarify what you mean you know in your

1029
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,520
summary

1030
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,920
in the assessment in your impact and as

1031
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,640
well as

1032
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,680
you want them to give you um also advice

1033
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,520
for example if you have missed out a

1034
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,520
certain area of mitigations that could

1035
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,640
have been applied

1036
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,160
uh this is something that based on the

1037
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,680
siso's experience

1038
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,880
and engagement with different

1039
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,720
stakeholders that is something that can

1040
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,200
be provided for you so threat briefing

1041
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:39,760
itself

1042
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,079
is different from incident briefing the

1043
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,040
intent

1044
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,760
is to be preemptive we want to be

1045
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,680
proactive and not reactive

1046
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,599
so this is so you want to show

1047
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,920
the actions that you have taken you know

1048
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,960
to the cso

1049
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,520
you provide a form of visibility you

1050
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,880
know that you are actually

1051
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,119
following up on ongoing and active

1052
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,319
threats

1053
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,319
you want to provide update that are we

1054
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,240
affected by those threats

1055
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,000
uh you want to update them are the

1056
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,720
security tools blocking this activity

1057
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,680
uh this malware this malicious activity

1058
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,800
and as well as

1059
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,880
what have you put in place uh to look

1060
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,480
out for or to prevent this from

1061
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,200
happening

1062
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,720
so um if there is any gaps that you have

1063
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,200
faced

1064
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,839
during your course of either providing

1065
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,040
mitigations

1066
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,599
or preventative actions this is the

1067
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,520
moment this is the session that you want

1068
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,079
to

1069
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,040
inform your cso so that they can either

1070
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,000
provide you that

1071
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,680
support or provide you that resource

1072
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,480
or initiatives you know for you to drive

1073
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,520
through so that those

1074
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,880
gaps get resolved so based on my

1075
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,319
experience

1076
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,400
this kind of threat briefings have been

1077
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,000
commonly sought after

1078
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,359
from uh csos from executives um

1079
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,160
this is across various industries or

1080
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,359
organizations

1081
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,839
and they they want it more regularly

1082
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,079
than incident briefings

1083
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,200
because from there the siso is also

1084
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,839
in form of the trends that's happening

1085
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,400
and what are the defenses or the lack of

1086
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,160
that is related to these threats so um

1087
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,880
i would say like um what is the benefits

1088
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,359
now

1089
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,640
um you know covering that aspect um that

1090
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,480
they would actually have an

1091
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,040
understanding is this gap something that

1092
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,520
uh you know top of mind for the cso for

1093
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,720
them to address

1094
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,760
uh if not at least they are aware and

1095
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,560
you know is there a collaboration and

1096
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:36,960
need

1097
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,960
for different teams in information

1098
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,480
security sometimes

1099
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,040
it's not just uh the security operations

1100
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,480
team that needs to be involved

1101
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,800
but the engineering as well as the

1102
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,760
governance team

1103
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,040
so these are opportunities that the cso

1104
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,079
can suggest

1105
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,480
of course if outside of the information

1106
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,599
security division

1107
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,000
you need to work with different business

1108
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,720
units

1109
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,240
or the engineering the

1110
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,640
desktop support the server teams the

1111
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,680
applications team

1112
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,560
this is the this is also the period that

1113
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,520
the cso would

1114
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,280
advise is this a doable initiative

1115
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,560
finally um you want the cso to be aware

1116
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,119
of the current threats and um if they

1117
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,960
are not able to address them because of

1118
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,079
the gaps we have

1119
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,839
because this is a business requirement

1120
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,000
that we need to fulfill and we are not

1121
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,599
able to address those risks

1122
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,680
then there is a risk acceptance that

1123
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,200
from the sister point of view

1124
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,240
um you know the cso is able to accept

1125
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,720
now i think that the main gist at this

1126
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,720
point what i want to share is that

1127
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,160
um all along um this uh you know

1128
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,000
focusing on the cso support

1129
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,119
is one uh main uh benefits

1130
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,520
that uh you know your an operations team

1131
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,400
can gain

1132
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,560
uh by providing a threat briefing and

1133
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,680
update to them

1134
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,520
how about you know to the security

1135
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,720
operation so now

1136
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,040
if you are a blue team uh and you're not

1137
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,720
from security operations you're from

1138
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,880
either incident response you're from uh

1139
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,880
digital forensics but you do not have a

1140
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,480
threat intelligence team

1141
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,640
um security operations would still

1142
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,560
benefit from a threat briefing

1143
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,160
and in the next couple of slides i'll

1144
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,720
share what is the benefit that they will

1145
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,040
achieve now first in the threat analysis

1146
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,800
provided to them it's not so longer the

1147
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,319
concise version it would be the

1148
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,240
operational version now i'm interested

1149
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,839
in the attack details

1150
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,000
so i would like to know what is the

1151
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,599
indicator of a text what techniques are

1152
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,200
being used if you can reference the

1153
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,960
miter attack id

1154
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,200
because a lot of times miter attack

1155
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,640
framework is being used

1156
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,319
that's helpful as well as tactics

1157
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:45,599
what was attack surface what data was

1158
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:46,240
used

1159
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,160
was exfiltrated what data was being

1160
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,319
utilized and was there any

1161
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:54,000
actively exploited cve or zero day or

1162
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,480
what malware usually um in this case

1163
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,520
operational level

1164
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,680
uh malware is always something that we

1165
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,800
always cover

1166
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,520
um and the difference between this and

1167
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,680
the cso version is that there's only two

1168
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,400
sections

1169
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,839
you give the summary and you give the

1170
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,920
assessment why because for the impact

1171
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,359
you probably wouldn't know it till you

1172
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,040
have done a search

1173
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,720
or a verification so you know

1174
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,520
the assessment would probably only have

1175
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,079
information

1176
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,240
that you you do at that point when you

1177
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,880
do this briefing or this analysis for

1178
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,280
uh the security operations team so it's

1179
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,000
very much

1180
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,200
if there is any current gaps in terms of

1181
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,359
we know that we are not able we have do

1182
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:34,319
not have visibility

1183
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:35,760
in certain environments these are the

1184
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,520
gaps that you want to mention

1185
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,599
if uh what other action you have taken

1186
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,359
to determine you have verified with

1187
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,040
vulnerability management team

1188
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,880
that we do use these systems we have

1189
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,040
this version that is in place we

1190
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,000
verified the network

1191
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,160
team um what are the indicators of

1192
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,839
compromised suite we have done did we

1193
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,440
see any activity

1194
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,000
which stakeholders have we notified so

1195
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,079
this is more of like a high level

1196
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,760
follow-up action you have taken

1197
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,160
before you share this threat analysis

1198
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,839
with security operations

1199
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,640
now that being said we try to keep it

1200
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,000
within five minutes

1201
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,319
because running over time is not going

1202
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,559
to help our security operations team to

1203
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,240
stay focused on

1204
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,680
you know the details that you're sharing

1205
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,839
with them so ideally you should keep it

1206
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,200
to five minutes

1207
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,359
now um once again i bring back dark side

1208
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,359
ransomware so now you see the example

1209
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:24,960
it's a bit different this time

1210
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,160
um we would include what was the

1211
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,599
initial access um what was cva

1212
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,800
um what protocol was being used um

1213
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,319
as well as um what was the encryption

1214
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:42,079
uh method uh encryption key that was

1215
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:42,720
being used

1216
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,040
now why do we want this because if the

1217
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,319
security operating

1218
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,960
operations is able uh to do searches

1219
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,800
that they know that rdp is not being

1220
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,440
used

1221
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,040
now that this could be used as a use

1222
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,599
case uh to detect suspicious activity

1223
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,800
same for tor now if they are aware that

1224
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,760
um

1225
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,400
that we do not use this particular

1226
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,040
encryption

1227
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,960
uh key these methods within the

1228
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,319
environment this is something that they

1229
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:07,200
could also

1230
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,760
uh do a detection or even a block so

1231
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,119
this is very much

1232
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,800
you want to write or provide information

1233
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,680
to them

1234
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,240
that they can use for detections for

1235
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,359
threat hunting

1236
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,280
you know for for blocking for prevention

1237
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,720
things that they can use

1238
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,480
for action now what about the assessment

1239
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,319
if you have run a sweep and you found

1240
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:29,839
out that there was no activity

1241
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:32,079
you could mention that same for the

1242
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:33,680
patch if you are aware that after

1243
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,280
following a vulnerability management

1244
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:35,839
team

1245
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,160
the patch was updated on was fully

1246
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,319
patched uh scene switch date you want to

1247
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,000
put it down as well as other follow-ups

1248
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,520
you've done with other teams

1249
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,680
to put in blocks so i would say that

1250
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,559
this is a

1251
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,839
an example that how it is different

1252
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:52,720
when you are providing that same thread

1253
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,280
analysis to your security operations

1254
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,240
versus your cso now you same same thing

1255
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,280
you collate that

1256
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,000
you know uh take three to five you know

1257
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,839
because you want to keep it within

1258
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:07,440
25 minutes so if if each threat analysis

1259
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,079
is five minutes

1260
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:09,359
you want to keep it between 25 if

1261
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,200
there's five you want it to be either

1262
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,720
weekly or fortnightly

1263
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,400
um because you don't want them to be out

1264
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,720
of touch so you want to receive

1265
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,240
um you know feedback from them to

1266
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,240
understand like hey is this something

1267
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,559
that you find useful is this information

1268
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:23,599
sufficient for you

1269
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,400
to take action on to go um search for

1270
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,480
the activity on our edr

1271
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,960
on our network logs so this this is the

1272
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,960
kind of purpose that you want

1273
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,000
you want to highlight trends and tell

1274
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,559
them the new tactics or techniques that

1275
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,319
you know attackers are now using

1276
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,400
you want them to be vigilant to be

1277
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,760
suspicious you know

1278
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,920
what they should defend or to be

1279
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,960
cautious about

1280
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,240
so that when they are doing their

1281
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,880
day-to-day work they are aware of that

1282
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,000
and you know do further analysis uh you

1283
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,720
know before

1284
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,200
deeming that it is a false positive so

1285
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,000
uh this

1286
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,720
the intent is to be proactive uh during

1287
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,240
early stages

1288
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,760
of the attack because it is more

1289
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,359
effective and costs less

1290
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,920
uh than later stages um when the action

1291
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,040
objectives is met

1292
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,599
so such threat i would say threat

1293
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,040
briefings have been found to be very

1294
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:13,680
useful

1295
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,599
uh to security operations team you know

1296
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,359
across various organizations because

1297
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:19,680
they don't have time to read thread

1298
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,760
briefs sorry threat reports

1299
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,319
daily from various sources even if they

1300
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:25,359
are reliable

1301
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,920
so you know this gives them a heads-up

1302
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,760
of potential attacks

1303
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,359
and you know they get informed of

1304
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,680
available defenses or even the lack of

1305
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,920
defenses if we have any gaps so i think

1306
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,200
that this is the intent

1307
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,920
you want to keep it also in person or

1308
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,800
via video

1309
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,720
so that it is interactive for an ask

1310
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,559
question clarify

1311
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,040
uh if needed so that you also know what

1312
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,640
do they get interested about

1313
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,040
to do the future threat uh analysis and

1314
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,440
threat briefings

1315
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,079
so i'll just touch on you know some of

1316
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:56,480
the

1317
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,680
um benefits you know of having this so

1318
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:00,400
um

1319
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,240
the security operations team would now

1320
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,920
be able to analyze

1321
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,760
uh techniques and processes and

1322
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,040
understand that hey you know

1323
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,599
this sequence of activity is something

1324
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,400
that could be of a malicious intent

1325
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,200
they are aware of the current trends

1326
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:15,839
that's

1327
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,480
occurring in the industry external

1328
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,359
environment

1329
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:22,160
uh impacting other organizations uh

1330
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,760
other industries as well

1331
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,680
and perhaps you know what gaps do we

1332
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,079
have or foresee what gaps do we have

1333
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,920
in future so i think this is something

1334
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,680
that you know of benefit to them because

1335
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,119
they are the one that's handling the

1336
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:34,079
analysis

1337
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,440
as well as uh you know following up the

1338
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,480
cases for incident uh response to

1339
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,119
to to do further analysis the next is

1340
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,319
that you want them

1341
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,359
uh to them it is an efficient action

1342
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:49,920
because you want to give them you know

1343
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,359
actions that they can take

1344
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:54,160
you know to run the searches uh in with

1345
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,440
the tools that they have in the

1346
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,000
environment

1347
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,400
that they have so being efficient in

1348
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,680
that space for them

1349
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,920
uh by you know just only covering

1350
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,200
information they need

1351
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,599
in the summary for that threat analysis

1352
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,440
uh it definitely is much more useful

1353
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,280
than giving them a full-blown

1354
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,880
attack report and then finally

1355
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,720
it would help them to know whether they

1356
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,040
need to engage other divisions

1357
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,880
you know other teams it could be within

1358
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,720
the information security

1359
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,440
division you know engineering teams

1360
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,000
governance

1361
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,480
teams or vulnerability management pen

1362
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,119
testing

1363
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,480
or do i need to go out of our division

1364
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,559
you know touch on other business units

1365
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,640
uh if if there's a need to work with hr

1366
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,119
or even uh different engineering teams

1367
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:39,680
um

1368
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,559
you know it support uh because uh there

1369
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:43,760
is a need to do that

1370
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,240
so i think that this this entire session

1371
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,119
would give them

1372
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,720
uh this track briefing would give them

1373
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,720
that thought do i need to do this in

1374
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,359
future

1375
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,280
is this something we foresee so you also

1376
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,960
give them that level of

1377
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,359
future planning finally i think that i'd

1378
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:59,040
just like to give a take away

1379
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,160
that threat briefing is a very efficient

1380
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,880
way

1381
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,240
to bring attention to analysis

1382
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,400
that you have done mitigations you have

1383
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,079
applied so it can be

1384
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,480
risks or gaps that you have but

1385
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,520
definitely

1386
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,640
um you cover um the threat analysis

1387
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,119
because

1388
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,760
it was relevant you know to those risks

1389
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,359
that your cso have expressed

1390
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,160
interest in and uh it also highlights

1391
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,000
the techniques and tactics that

1392
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
uh the security operations team need to

1393
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,599
be vigilant about

1394
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,799
um and therefore even

1395
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:35,119
if you do not have a threat intelligence

1396
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,319
team a dedicated

1397
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,799
team that does that any member of the

1398
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:39,520
blue team

1399
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,040
which is the incident response the

1400
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,720
digital forensics even the threat

1401
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,520
hunting team

1402
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,160
you know can always prepare and deliver

1403
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,359
a threat briefing

1404
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:50,319
you know that is relevant to the chief

1405
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:51,920
information security officer

1406
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,960
or the security operations team so uh

1407
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,200
with that i'd like to conclude

1408
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,599

1536
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:19,040
presentation uh

1537
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,040
this presentation that you can see here

1538
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,080
is based on

1539
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,320
as we are saying here in this little

1540
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,120
disclaimer

1541
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,960
based on true events last year we

1542
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,239
suffered a

1543
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:32,000
pretty pretty intense incident

1544
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,120
for us which affected some some

1545
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:38,239
hospitals we've been

1546
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:41,040
modifying the some names and dates for

1547
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,800
the sake of the dlp

1548
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,760
just a quick disclaimer too uh no haris

1549
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:46,159
or

1550
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:48,320
hares samples were harmed in the

1551
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,159
handling of this incident we just found

1552
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,520
that the

1553
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,520
the naming of the presentation fun and

1554
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,960
then we realized that

1555
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:58,159
there's a ransomware name like that so

1556
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:00,239
uh and yeah finally sorry about the the

1557
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:02,800
skills so the powerpoint and the paint

1558
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,360
skills uh it's not where what we like

1559
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,560
most we prefer

1560
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,920
other technical things uh yeah so

1561
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:11,040
basically very quick

1562
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,920
introduction we are the catalan assert a

1563
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,400
governmental cert

1564
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,679
which works inside the

1565
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:21,360
cyber security agency of catalonia we

1566
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,360
are a governmental cert for the whole

1567
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,400
government of catalonia we take care of

1568
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,920
of the whole government and its

1569
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,520
infrastructure but we also cover

1570
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,640
a wider scope like going from local

1571
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,000
administrations to

1572
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,480
public institutions all the public

1573
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,320
dependent sector from the

1574
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,280
the government also universities and

1575
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:43,920
research

1576
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,719
centers and whatnot and finally

1577
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,880
hospitals too

1578
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,800
so as i was saying before we are going

1579
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,640
to be talking about an incident

1580
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:55,280
we had to deal with last year it was

1581
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,320
just in the middle

1582
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,440
just after after the first lockdown we

1583
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,360
we suffered here in spain

1584
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,360
so basically it affected several

1585
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,719
hospitals

1586
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:08,159
uh it also escalated so it ended up

1587
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:11,120
almost affecting part a large part of

1588
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,960
our infrastructure

1589
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,360
at some point it did indeed feel like

1590
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,000
entering the

1591
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,560
the underwater so everything seemed to

1592
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:19,280
to start

1593
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,360
collapsing and it was quite an admire

1594
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,360
for for for us

1595
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:26,480
uh the incident itself it doesn't cover

1596
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,560
like crazy capabilities we were not

1597
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:30,000
facing a really advanced

1598
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,280
actor but still we had to deal with with

1599
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:36,080
many different factors uh

1600
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,159
it was quite complex and and that's

1601
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:39,920
something we wanted to to highlight

1602
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,360
that's something

1603
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,679
where we think that the value is is from

1604
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:45,120
from all these like

1605
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,960
uh we had to to deal with a lot of

1606
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,560
stakeholders we'll be talking about that

1607
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:48,960
but

1608
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,440
we were just wanted to to reflect that

1609
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:52,320
and some

1610
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,960
of the most some of the the key points

1611
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,159
or the schema we are going to be

1612
01:17:56,159 --> 01:17:57,679
following today so basically we're going

1613
01:17:57,679 --> 01:17:58,800
to be talking about the

1614
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,199
the incident's timeline talking about

1615
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:02,640
who it affected to

1616
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,120
the challenges we we had to face which

1617
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,880
mistakes we we made and

1618
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,440
also some luckily some some successes we

1619
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:10,960
had

1620
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,760
yep and as i said the the most important

1621
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,760
thing from us would be to to be able to

1622
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:16,480
transmit

1623
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,640
what we got from from you know all the

1624
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,840
value we got out of it

1625
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,640
just uh a quick introduction on the on

1626
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,080
the interface the user interface

1627
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,679
we're going to be using today so

1628
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:29,840
basically you're going to be seeing like

1629
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:30,320
different

1630
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:33,920
slides with a different uh reference to

1631
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:34,480
to what

1632
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,400
it is about so we might be talking about

1633
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,480
successes mistakes challenges

1634
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,960
actors what was the mood of the day for

1635
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,960
us in in that precise moment

1636
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:46,080
and how we how we evolve and walk the

1637
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:50,239
the path so yeah with no further ado

1638
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:54,400
please alberto go ahead

1639
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,239
then the ncm begins one day where we

1640
01:18:58,239 --> 01:18:59,760
detect an actor

1641
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,600
who is publishing an access to a

1642
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,199
hospital in spain

1643
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:05,440
we initially suggest that he may be in

1644
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,880
catalonia and we

1645
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:10,400
work with that hypothesis the actor

1646
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,880
says that he knows that he's a hospital

1647
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:15,280
and even so he has no problem about cell

1648
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,400
information

1649
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:20,159
he knows what that means the same

1650
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:23,360
statement also sells the credentials for

1651
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,480
one manufacturer and in this case our

1652
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,800
success was to monitor the sources

1653
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,760
and identify the initial stage of the

1654
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:34,000
incident

1655
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,560
so a little information about what we

1656
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,120
managed to find out from the actor

1657
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:42,239
it is siberian spider name we made up

1658
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:43,920
because your name in this game is a lot

1659
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,440
more boring and we love

1660
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:49,920
others to it this is a cyber criminal

1661
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,239
opportunist with enough experience

1662
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:54,320
more than 10 years in the underground

1663
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,320
forums not just very advanced

1664
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:59,520
but he has certain capabilities also

1665
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:02,640
in 2020 we have seen him participate in

1666
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,199
other incidents he has had a lot of

1667
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:06,320
activity

1668
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:10,320
some of them fabulous incidents

1669
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,520
based on that announcement one once

1670
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,199
identified the challenge we

1671
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:20,000
face is to identify which hospital may

1672
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,280
be affected

1673
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,080
in the constituency we have 68 centers

1674
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:24,960
age of

1675
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,040
reference and in the announcement there

1676
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:28,960
is only a little information about the

1677
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,800
technologies and some numbers

1678
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,280
such as the number of computers and

1679
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,000
servers

1680
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,120
for example we don't have integrated

1681
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,080
hospitals or we have invisibility in all

1682
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:40,880
of them

1683
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:43,840
so it is a problem for us so what we

1684
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:44,639
start

1685
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:47,920
is to do is purify the main candidates

1686
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:48,880
and start

1687
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,679
conducting them to carry out a series of

1688
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:52,320
hunting

1689
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:57,360
tasks the next success

1690
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:00,159
we have is is to able to identify that

1691
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:01,840
that hospital

1692
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,400
with very limited and simple hunting

1693
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,719
mission we managed to identify that one

1694
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:08,159
of the hospitals have been

1695
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:11,120
compromised throughout the athletic

1696
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,280
system

1697
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,840
in this case we will be talking about

1698
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,239
the first victim the first hospital

1699
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,320
which will be one one of the large

1700
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,159
hospitals in catalonia

1701
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:24,560
and that in this student during the

1702
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,280
pandemic

1703
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:30,159
we will have have a huge impact for us

1704
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:34,880
so we are managing this for our 13 days

1705
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:35,600
to get the

1706
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,920
main part of the investigation out and

1707
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,120
that at first

1708
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,360
we thought we had it content even

1709
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,719
eradicated

1710
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:45,199
if it is true that it was not until

1711
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:45,760
later

1712
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,159
that we realized that we made a series

1713
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:49,120
of mistakes

1714
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:52,320
with a full scope and it was not a

1715
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,760
complete eviction

1716
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,560
we didn't make a full scoping and it was

1717
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:57,600
not wasn't

1718
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:01,360
a complete direction meanwhile after

1719
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:04,320
14 days we realized that precisely a

1720
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,639
swiss power manufacturer which also

1721
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:08,000
includes the credentials in the

1722
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,080
advertisement we note

1723
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:13,199
it has impact if we run somewhere so we

1724
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:15,520
know that the credentials have been sold

1725
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:18,080
and we are very close to it happening to

1726
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,719
us as well

1727
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:26,639
16 days later when we are with

1728
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:29,199
this concert uh we detect an alert

1729
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:30,880
completely different from that

1730
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:33,679
of the hospital it is a mimikaz alert or

1731
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:35,120
a domain controller

1732
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:38,480
that it may make us think that there's a

1733
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,320
there has been a lateral movement at

1734
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,000
that at this time we are working with

1735
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,800
the hypothesis that it may be separate

1736
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,960
and really sincere because we have a

1737
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:49,360
different alerts at different sites

1738
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,920
also we do we need to consider that the

1739
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:52,960
two incidents

1740
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,960
may may be also related

1741
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,840
this alert is generated in tax office

1742
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:03,360
also in catalonia with a certain size

1743
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:06,080
and 40 minutes later in a totally

1744
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,120
different environment

1745
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,360
we again detect another alert also

1746
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,280
related to damping credentials so at

1747
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,239
this moment

1748
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:14,239
it is obvious that there is a lateral

1749
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,320
moving through different environments

1750
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:16,960
and

1751
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,920
at some point isn't being credentialed

1752
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,560
in this case the second alert arrives in

1753
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,239
one of the domain controllers of a

1754
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:26,080
regional government where we will be

1755
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,199
talking about

1756
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:30,400
200 000 users and part of the 60

1757
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,840
of the domain support by the

1758
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,239
infrastructure

1759
01:23:34,239 --> 01:23:36,639
here we have three incidents and we

1760
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:38,320
started looking for the common thread

1761
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,920
and we identified that this

1762
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:42,960
it is the same provider that manage the

1763
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,600
the free environments from here we

1764
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,760
discard the hypothesis that they are

1765
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,679
independent initials and we begin to

1766
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:51,840
relate it to the first season we have

1767
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,360
almost 17

1768
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:56,639
days ago in the first hospital so here

1769
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:57,840
we can state that

1770
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,400
it has been as a connector that has both

1771
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,120
the credentials or that

1772
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,840
he's trying to spank in his scope or

1773
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:06,639
prefer

1774
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:08,800
he have the entire entire provider's

1775
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,360
interest to compromise and the actor is

1776
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:15,120
entering through it at this time we

1777
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,960
introduced a astray connector

1778
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:20,320
who will be our provider we have called

1779
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:20,880
him

1780
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:23,520
an intention in intentional provider

1781
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:24,159
where

1782
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,960
this basically basically has at the end

1783
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,239
or we discovered that the

1784
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:30,800
practice that we've encouraged to manage

1785
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,080
infrastructure were not

1786
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:35,440
exactly the best or most eugenic as they

1787
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:36,000
should be

1788
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,400
ideally in the end there were many

1789
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,080
environments many domains with

1790
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,400
credentials and network visibility

1791
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,679
that allows you to move or jump from one

1792
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:48,320
to another system the typical like the

1793
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,000
administration errors that

1794
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,440
compromise the security so

1795
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:56,480
we are faced with many challenges in

1796
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:57,520
this point

1797
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,520
a situation where there is no real

1798
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,920
segmentation retention is often typical

1799
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,719
is insufficient obsolete systems the

1800
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:05,440
provider

1801
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:08,080
the provider is very large it has many

1802
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:08,880
environments

1803
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,719
it is almost easy for the attacker to

1804
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:12,560
move down for us because

1805
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,800
we have to deal with many people because

1806
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,000
the systems are owned

1807
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,960
by many different people in the

1808
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:19,679
executive

1809
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:21,760
committees there are there are more than

1810
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,920
80 stakeholders that we must

1811
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,639
be dealt with different points of

1812
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:27,520
contact

1813
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,520
and it is a great task to explain to

1814
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,639
everyone and

1815
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:33,920
and to be agree deal with

1816
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:37,440
nervous and pressure from so many points

1817
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,840
and also to us to that we have the

1818
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,159
participation of an incident response

1819
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:44,080
team from a large manufacturer

1820
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:47,120
who with whom we also have to coordinate

1821
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,000
in the right way how to work together

1822
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:50,560
also

1823
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,600
making our criteria prevail there the

1824
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,679
business is very concerned about what

1825
01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:57,600
has happened with the credentials which

1826
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,120
is true we share the

1827
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,920
discussion but it is also true that we

1828
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:02,639
continue

1829
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:04,719
to have an active attacker moving

1830
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:06,159
through the network

1831
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:08,960
sometimes it's even difficult to argue

1832
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:10,800
what has happened

1833
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:13,040
the team responsibility responsible for

1834
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,239
calculation there is

1835
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:16,719
its conclusion is that the risk is low

1836
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:17,840
which ends up

1837
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,560
affecting us by needing to gain leverage

1838
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:23,040
or restraint in the management of the

1839
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:25,600
incident and finally they asked the

1840
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:26,400
attackers

1841
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,320
in the engine which means in addition to

1842
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:32,480
all these managing this communication

1843
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:35,520
another good thing about what we managed

1844
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,320
to do in this

1845
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,560
incident is to attack lateral movements

1846
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,960
especially by following the trial of the

1847
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:43,679
attacker identifying the tools he used

1848
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:44,159
and the

1849
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:47,520
command controls with this

1850
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:50,320
we were able to identify new victims

1851
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,159
such as a second hospital

1852
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:54,960
in this case a little smaller but also a

1853
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,120
reference to very important one

1854
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:00,320
in another region of catalonia and just

1855
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:00,800
below

1856
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,000
we identify as metal a little smaller

1857
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,080
but also important and even in this

1858
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,360
lateral movement

1859
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:10,880
it is reaching primary care centers

1860
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,360
also distributed through the territory

1861
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,639
what we are clear

1862
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:16,400
at this time is that the attacker is

1863
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,560
jumping from system to system

1864
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:21,040
and it's not very clear where he is he

1865
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:21,679
is going

1866
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:24,960
from from systems at this time

1867
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,320
we are also aware that we made at least

1868
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,840
two other mistakes

1869
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,280
the provider carries out the commission

1870
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,600
of the computer symbols the provider

1871
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:36,400
shoot down

1872
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:40,000
with our consent without being informed

1873
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,440
and the attacker was using these

1874
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,120
computers to pivot

1875
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:45,360
and in addition in the management of the

1876
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,520
first year we also removed

1877
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,320
some systems that the attacker was using

1878
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,120
as an

1879
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:54,239
operational center so this made him

1880
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:57,040
alert and it is clearly noticeable that

1881
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:57,360
he

1882
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:00,080
discussed a change in the attacker

1883
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:00,960
behavior

1884
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,760
he began to try to establish contact for

1885
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,199
many other computers

1886
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:07,760
and try to deploy persistence with other

1887
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,000
tools

1888
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,880
at this point and we fit in ourselves

1889
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:13,199
with

1890
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:16,239
new challenge to take on to say when we

1891
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:16,719
stop

1892
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:19,360
in an environment as big as we can in

1893
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,360
the end much of the infrastructure you

1894
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:22,159
cannot

1895
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:25,199
ask to be rebuilt there comes a time

1896
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:27,679
when you have to make a commitment

1897
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:29,600
at some point you have to make a

1898
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:30,719
decision i

1899
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:33,920
start to take clean

1900
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:37,120
it was here when considered at least to

1901
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,800
apply the fish containment plan

1902
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:41,520
the first most radical action we have a

1903
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:42,320
corporate

1904
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:45,360
environment several hospitals more of

1905
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:46,080
their

1906
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,560
environments and the least we wanted to

1907
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:49,120
do

1908
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:51,600
was isolate and secure the corporate

1909
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,040
part by increasing the

1910
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:56,159
detection capacity from there

1911
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:58,159
we continue working on the rest to

1912
01:28:58,159 --> 01:28:59,520
discover where else

1913
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,639
it has persisted we don't interrupt

1914
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:06,400
the rest of the infrastructure

1915
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:09,520
from here we do tracking we apply

1916
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,360
canteen with our resilient strategy a

1917
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:12,560
mechanism that

1918
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:15,360
if the file we covered by other

1919
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,760
techniques and we were able to find

1920
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,600
all the commands and controls and all

1921
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,760
the connections that the attacker was

1922
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:22,560
using

1923
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,199
in addition the attacker tried to hide

1924
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:26,400
he thought of

1925
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,480
one command and control and that one

1926
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:29,600
another he

1927
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,400
was not very active he could lift them

1928
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,000
off or for a long time

1929
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,960
he was trying not to make too much noise

1930
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,000
he was trying to

1931
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,080
be a little careful

1932
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,600
in addition at this moment we while we

1933
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,760
are preparing the female eviction

1934
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,080
we find another statement by a

1935
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,159
completely different actor who talks

1936
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:54,239
about the access to a hospital

1937
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:57,520
again we think that he is talking about

1938
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,960
hospital one

1939
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,760
plus hospital too then we are back in

1940
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:04,080
the first hospital starting situation

1941
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:06,400
you can sell the credentials to someone

1942
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,560
who wants to deploy the ransomware

1943
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,280
from somewhere in this case not it's a a

1944
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:11,840
single

1945
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,800
hospital but into hospital in this case

1946
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,000
we discord the

1947
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,480
rest of the hypothesis and we are left

1948
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:19,280
with

1949
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,199
the one that we have probably been

1950
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:22,960
facing the second actor

1951
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,600
who was working with the first and our

1952
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,159
movie in laterally

1953
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:31,040
this actor this other actor would be

1954
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,440
validating his spider another name

1955
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:35,760
another opportunistic initial access

1956
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,840
broker in this case we were able to

1957
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:38,639
identify

1958
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,880
that there has been a relationship and

1959
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:41,760
some

1960
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:44,880
type of transaction between them and he

1961
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:45,520
is the

1962
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,920
director we've been dealing with most of

1963
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,320
the days here

1964
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,960
as we already have the eviction plan

1965
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:53,920
prepared

1966
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,639
only this announcement this has advanced

1967
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:58,320
everything and we anticipate the

1968
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,360
execution of the

1969
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:01,920
plan we anticipate everything two days

1970
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,040
putting everyone

1971
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:06,239
up and running and in the end making the

1972
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:08,000
order eradication with all the

1973
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,960
infrastructure that we have identified

1974
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,800
more a series of very strong

1975
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,800
restrictions in the

1976
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:18,880
in the affected environments

1977
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:23,280
uh what has happened to us at this point

1978
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:26,080
another error that we identified because

1979
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:29,600
while we prepared the plan until we went

1980
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,400
to execute

1981
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,600
we probably wait a long time

1982
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:37,040
because we wanted to execute the well

1983
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:39,440
we wanted to have everything under

1984
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,360
control it also depends on the

1985
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:43,600
requirements of the provider himself who

1986
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:44,719
asked us to

1987
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:48,000
to what uh in the end what happened to

1988
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:48,400
us

1989
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,800
as the attacker was already alerted and

1990
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,520
is the

1991
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,920
that they managed to take route in in

1992
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:54,560
many

1993
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:57,600
systems in the end uh

1994
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,000
nothing more just an an example or to

1995
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,360
give an image of

1996
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:04,239
how complicated everything has been the

1997
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:05,040
paths we

1998
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:07,600
travel the amount of systems jumps

1999
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:08,400
research

2000
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:12,239
that we have to do at times

2001
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:14,719
it seems that we were going to enter the

2002
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:15,679
underworld

2003
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:18,880
but by luck or reform or the hours we

2004
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:20,560
dedicate we were able to

2005
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:24,480
to return among the living

2006
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:27,760
at the end of the of this incident

2007
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:31,600
we what we do try is to make the most of

2008
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,080
it to achieve a positive output for

2009
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:34,960
rochelle

2010
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,880
in that sense we managed to apply

2011
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,960
restrictions on our communications that

2012
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:42,080
were unnecessary or already stabilized

2013
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:45,280
reduce the trust relationships between

2014
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:49,120
domains or even even deploy mvi schemes

2015
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:52,080
or increase lock retention improve the

2016
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:54,800
operation model with the provider and

2017
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:55,520
shut down

2018
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:59,600
the entry and attackers infrastructure

2019
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:02,480
here are some key points that fan

2020
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:05,199
introduces

2021
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:08,480
thank you alberto so basically one one

2022
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:08,960
of the

2023
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,600
first things we realized was that uh it

2024
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:12,840
was not

2025
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:15,440
strictly possible to to follow the book

2026
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,040
so that's something we would

2027
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:19,760
have liked to do but at that point we

2028
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,679
realized that we had to adapt so

2029
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:23,360
for instance alberto mentioned that we

2030
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:24,719
had the participation of

2031
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:28,159
a different team different ir team

2032
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:30,639
and they were proposing just for in this

2033
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:31,920
case watch and learn

2034
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:33,920
we have to wait we don't want to to

2035
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:36,560
alert the attacker we totally agreed

2036
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:39,840
but we still had to have to make a

2037
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:40,560
commitment

2038
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:43,840
and take a decision because things were

2039
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:44,400
going on

2040
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:48,080
we knew that there was being a activity

2041
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,880
we also had suspicions that the same

2042
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,000
actor had sold

2043
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,840
those accesses to to a different

2044
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,840
operator probably a ransomware operator

2045
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,480
that had

2046
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:59,520
struck a different uh victim

2047
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,960
so so yeah it was like yeah we know

2048
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:05,440
how we would like to do it uh maybe we

2049
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:06,560
we we have to

2050
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:09,679
to do other things and to adapt uh even

2051
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:12,080
we went to to talk to other providers

2052
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,239
and and we got like feedback

2053
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:15,600
and it was pointing to different

2054
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,199
directions some some of them were

2055
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:18,320
telling us that

2056
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:21,360
yeah you should just wait analyze

2057
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:22,560
everything identify

2058
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,880
all the activity all the the footholds

2059
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,159
and then

2060
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:29,040
take a step others were just basically

2061
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:30,840
proposing to to try to

2062
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:34,639
apply at least those measures that could

2063
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:37,600
guarantee that the the most critical

2064
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,600
assets were not affected

2065
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:43,040
uh at the end well that only reflected

2066
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:43,600
that there

2067
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,760
it was not like a clear answer and and

2068
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,360
we had to to

2069
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:50,800
try to identify what we should do

2070
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:53,119
uh it was also quite important for us to

2071
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:54,800
to have

2072
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,840
at least we identify the need to have

2073
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,520
like a specialized team someone that

2074
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:00,480
knows how

2075
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,639
this type of environment works and what

2076
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:04,800
character characteristics

2077
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:09,040
might affect the the work we were doing

2078
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:12,719
so yeah that was important for us

2079
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:15,679
in the same line we tried to deploy like

2080
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:16,239
a

2081
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:18,719
cross-functional team we were not only

2082
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:19,440
uh

2083
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:22,320
having like our incident responders on

2084
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:23,119
on

2085
01:35:23,119 --> 01:35:25,600
forensic technicians there just doing

2086
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:26,560
their work

2087
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,600
we also had like uh someone

2088
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:32,080
that could take a look at the what was

2089
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,360
going on and take some

2090
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:36,239
conclusion conclusions out of it so just

2091
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:37,119
a bit

2092
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:39,440
far from from the heat of the the bottle

2093
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:41,679
uh at the end just mixing up

2094
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:43,840
some knowledge from the outside but also

2095
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,199
from the the inside

2096
01:35:45,199 --> 01:35:47,440
we were able to have like a quite

2097
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:48,480
complete picture

2098
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,760
of what was going on so it was not only

2099
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:54,800
dancing incident itself but the actor

2100
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,320
that was behind it and

2101
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:59,760
on his ttps in this case uh

2102
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:02,000
just to summarize some of the challenges

2103
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
that alberto has already gone through

2104
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,480
so basically first thing was that this

2105
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:07,840
was a huge

2106
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:11,440
incident for us uh it it involved

2107
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:13,600
many different stakeholders from many

2108
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,119
different businesses

2109
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:18,880
uh so the first day as alberto alberto

2110
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:19,840
mentioned

2111
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:22,880
it was more than 80 people just in the

2112
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:23,600
same meeting

2113
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,920
trying to understand what was going on

2114
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:27,920
uh they were even proposing how we

2115
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:28,800
should be

2116
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:31,440
driving and make doing our investigation

2117
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:33,760
so i've read something in some blog

2118
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:36,719
why don't you look in this registry but

2119
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:38,800
then when we had to to ask for some

2120
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:42,239
action we were getting like uh an answer

2121
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:43,280
in the sense that

2122
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,199
uh no we cannot do that because that

2123
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:47,119
that's going to affect the business

2124
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:49,760
uh you cannot reset the credentials for

2125
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,040
instance because yeah we are

2126
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:53,840
working everyone is working remotely and

2127
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:54,320
that

2128
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,000
that's going to affect a lot of people

2129
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,080
and it's going to generate a huge impact

2130
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:00,320
so we had to deal with that it was like

2131
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,159
we would like to do this this is what we

2132
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:02,719
should do

2133
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:05,679
but again uh it's not always by the book

2134
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:06,800
that you can play

2135
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,719
uh in this case we we just had to to

2136
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:09,840
adapt and

2137
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,239
still keep everyone in the on the boat

2138
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:13,040
on the same boat

2139
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:16,639
just working for for the same goal uh

2140
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:18,320
it was also quite important for all of

2141
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,080
them to to keep everyone

2142
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:22,320
updated so at some point we ended up

2143
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:23,520
having many many

2144
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,199
different meetings that's something we

2145
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:26,960
we know that we have to

2146
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:29,760
try to avoid like executive meetings

2147
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,360
then technical ones and

2148
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:33,600
so at the end some of us were just

2149
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:34,639
basically

2150
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:36,800
explaining the same thing over and over

2151
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:37,679
again

2152
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:40,400
it was a quite huge as i said large and

2153
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:41,440
a theory genius

2154
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:44,560
complex environment uh albert alberto

2155
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,239
already said it

2156
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:48,159
it was easier for for the attacker to

2157
01:37:48,159 --> 01:37:49,280
move around

2158
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,280
because yeah there were this

2159
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,960
configuration these

2160
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:55,600
uh links between systems and when we

2161
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:58,400
wanted to to do something to reach some

2162
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:01,520
environment we might found that it was a

2163
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,080
different

2164
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:04,159
point of contact so we had to talk to to

2165
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:05,440
a different person

2166
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:08,800
and and it was never easy uh

2167
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,199
as i as we've already mentioned uh we

2168
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:12,480
had to adapt

2169
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,480
we know we have our processes but that's

2170
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:16,159
something you have to

2171
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:18,560
uh to be able that it must be flexible

2172
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,800
enough to to adapt to it when whenever

2173
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,199
you've already started handling an

2174
01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:24,159
incident

2175
01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:26,320
even the the containment plans we used

2176
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,440
and deployed

2177
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,440
were customized for each of those

2178
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:30,800
environments so

2179
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:34,159
one recipe recipient might not work for

2180
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:35,760
a different one like

2181
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,440
it was totally customized because yeah

2182
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:39,040
at the end you wanted to

2183
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:41,840
to kick out the the attacker and one

2184
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:44,960
important thing too was to whether

2185
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:47,520
how how do you decide whether you can

2186
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,440
close the incident and consider that it

2187
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:49,760
is

2188
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:52,320
well contained and it won't reproduce

2189
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,040
again

2190
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:54,800
that that was difficult for us because

2191
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,159
we knew that

2192
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:59,760
having like a final and complete

2193
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,960
knowledge or to be sure about it was not

2194
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:03,520
going to be

2195
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:07,119
an easy task yeah and finally

2196
01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:10,000
before we end some lessons we we took

2197
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,600
from from it all

2198
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,520
in this case we realized that our

2199
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:14,800
capabilities uh

2200
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:17,920
did not scale up we were facing like a

2201
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:20,639
quite distributed situation or

2202
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:21,280
environment

2203
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:24,239
infrastructure we were working on and

2204
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:25,199
then

2205
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:28,320
we realized that up until that point we

2206
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:28,960
had been

2207
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:31,440
dealing with way a smaller environment

2208
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,440
so our tool set

2209
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:35,600
our processes were more focused on

2210
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,440
having yeah we could even

2211
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:40,400
follow the breadcrumb if necessary but

2212
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,480
in this case it was huge

2213
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:45,600
the the attacker had the

2214
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:48,320
was available was able to move around to

2215
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:50,400
freely move around

2216
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:53,760
it was not easy with what we had

2217
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:56,000
also that we depend at least at that

2218
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,080
point we depended too much on others

2219
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,159
capacities we were asking for

2220
01:40:00,159 --> 01:40:01,679
acquisitions and doing

2221
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:04,080
running some tasks by the provider and

2222
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:05,760
we then would realize that that

2223
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,840
that's a problem because that that also

2224
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,600
depends on their capacity

2225
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,520
and if they don't do something right you

2226
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:14,320
are going to have to to ask for it again

2227
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,920
it's also important to have a protocol

2228
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,719
or at least a an operational model with

2229
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:21,840
or to to to be able to work

2230
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,920
together with other ir teams in this

2231
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:26,639
case alberto already mentioned it

2232
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:28,719
we started getting like input from a

2233
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:29,679
different

2234
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:31,760
specialized team and they they had the

2235
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:32,880
name so

2236
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:35,840
everyone was was happy with them saying

2237
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:36,719
what they thought

2238
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:38,639
that's fine but at some point you have

2239
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:40,320
to to make it clear

2240
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:43,199
that someone has to lead that and uh

2241
01:40:43,199 --> 01:40:44,000
feedback is

2242
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,040
very welcome but if you have to take a

2243
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:48,840
decision that's going to depend on

2244
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,400
someone uh

2245
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,840
yeah we've already mentioned the

2246
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,639
importance of having a a team that is

2247
01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:56,400
specialized in a specific

2248
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:59,600
environment and and that's something we

2249
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:02,639
we suffer or we went through because

2250
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:06,320
it was a hospital alberto has already

2251
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:09,040
explained that pretty well and final

2252
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:09,600
point

2253
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:14,159
just that it was a quite intense

2254
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:17,440
uh engage we had to to be working

2255
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:20,480
during more than three weeks and we

2256
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:21,360
started quite

2257
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:24,159
quite heavily like oh no not heavily

2258
01:41:24,159 --> 01:41:24,960
right

2259
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:28,000
we put a lot of effort in the first days

2260
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,440
and we didn't want to to burn

2261
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:34,960

we can live up to it today um but yeah

2331
01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:56,480
so my name

2332
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:59,679
is uh kevin glsen and my team member

2333
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:02,320
here is mark van impe we're both on the

2334
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,000
security insta response response team

2335
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,440
here at netflix

2336
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:07,840
and today we're going to talk through a

2337
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,360
piece of orchestration we built to help

2338
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:13,119
us manage incidents here at netflix

2339
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:16,560
so i don't know how everyone here feels

2340
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:17,360
but i know

2341
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,920
personally before incidents you know

2342
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:20,639
this is very

2343
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:22,480
near and dear to my heart right

2344
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:24,400
everything feels like it's going fine

2345
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:24,880
but

2346
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,000
you know in the back of your head you

2347
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,080
have a little bit of anxiety you know

2348
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,440
that at any moment something goes

2349
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:31,440
terribly wrong in this case we have the

2350
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:32,960
classic kind of clip of

2351
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:35,360
a ferris bueller's day off you know very

2352
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:36,159
easy to

2353
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:38,239
um things could go catastrophic very

2354
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:40,718
easily right

2355
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,760
and then once you discover that you do

2356
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:44,719
have an incident

2357
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:46,800
uh this is also the kind of feeling that

2358
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:47,760
is evoked

2359
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:50,080
in myself right so you see something is

2360
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:50,800
on fire

2361
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,159
you know you start to kind of take a

2362
01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:54,400
look at it um you try to

2363
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,400
try to do some analysis on it but you're

2364
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:57,920
very much um

2365
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:59,280
you know a little bit high levels of

2366
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:00,880
stress high levels ambiguity during the

2367
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:02,800
incident

2368
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:05,440
and then lastly after an incident you

2369
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:06,800
know it takes a lot out of you

2370
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,280
uh emotionally and and and and

2371
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:10,639
physically right we

2372
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:13,199
we heard the last uh presentation that

2373
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:15,760
you know they were very concerned about

2374
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:17,679
burning out their folks in those initial

2375
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:19,520
days right so it's it's very important

2376
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:20,000
for us

2377
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,159
at least to be cognizant of that for not

2378
01:45:22,159 --> 01:45:23,440
only of our own team

2379
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:25,440
but also the organization as a whole

2380
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,360
right we want to be effective

2381
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:29,199
and we need members throughout the

2382
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:33,119
organization to to be effective

2383
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,159
and then lastly how do you how a lot of

2384
01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:37,840
people feel about uh

2385
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,920
automation response um automation is

2386
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:42,000
great uh oftentimes though we see that

2387
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:42,320
it's

2388
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:45,520
trying to solve maybe the wrong problem

2389
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:48,719
and for us we don't expect to solve

2390
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:51,199
instant response through automation our

2391
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:52,400
ultimate goal here

2392
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,000
is to help people collaborate more

2393
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,760
effectively

2394
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:57,520
during and after an incident and give

2395
01:45:57,520 --> 01:45:58,800
them tools

2396
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,840
and data to make effective decisions

2397
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:04,960
um to help us resolve those incidents

2398
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:06,800
so that leads us to the next question

2399
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:10,159
how do we do that how do we

2400
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:12,000
try to automate some of those things and

2401
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,080
with us uh we developed

2402
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:17,679
a dispatch so what is dispatch um

2403
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:20,320
for us it's it's an orchestration system

2404
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:21,280
uh it helps us

2405
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:23,760
manage security incidents it integrates

2406
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:24,480
with with

2407
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:25,600
existing tools throughout the

2408
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:28,080
organization we don't expect

2409
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:30,320
uh the vast majority of users to even

2410
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:31,840
know what dispatch is and that's the way

2411
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:32,719
we prefer it

2412
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:34,159
it for us it should really be in the

2413
01:46:34,159 --> 01:46:36,560
background tying together tooling

2414
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:39,679
that your organization uses day-to-day

2415
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:40,960
and they're familiar with

2416
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:43,440
and helps them to use those those tools

2417
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:44,800
that are used for maybe other businesses

2418
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,000
processes

2419
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
to effectively respond to security

2420
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,400
incidents

2421
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:53,119
so what are some of our goals with

2422
01:46:53,119 --> 01:46:54,480
automation

2423
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:58,159
uh our first goal is is we're very um

2424
01:46:58,159 --> 01:47:00,080
you know one of our main thesis for for

2425
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:01,679
effectiveness response is that people

2426
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:02,080
resolve

2427
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:04,080
incidents and we need to get the right

2428
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,159
people in the room we need to get them

2429
01:47:06,159 --> 01:47:09,119
engaged we need to active communicating

2430
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:10,080
with us

2431
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,400
and we need to get them oriented quickly

2432
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:13,840
so for us that means

2433
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:15,920
when someone's uh we tagged them in an

2434
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:17,280
incident

2435
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:18,960
um you know they're asking questions of

2436
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:21,360
like okay is there a runbook for this

2437
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:23,360
uh who else do i need from my team or

2438
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:24,639
from other teams

2439
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:27,360
to be brought into this incident are

2440
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,280
there additional stakeholders that need

2441
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:30,719
to be notified about this picture

2442
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:31,920
incident is there

2443
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:35,280
someone a partner maybe or someone else

2444
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,800
in my sphere that that needs to be

2445
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,400
notified

2446
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:39,920
um and then where can i get information

2447
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:41,600
about this specific incident about

2448
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:44,000
what's what's happening like what what

2449
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,679
is the the subject of this program

2450
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:47,600
and and moreover what's already been

2451
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,199
done am i coming into this

2452
01:47:49,199 --> 01:47:50,560
halfway through am i right at the

2453
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:53,600
beginning do we know what do we know

2454
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:55,440
so our first goal is to get people

2455
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:56,719
engaged and oriented

2456
01:47:56,719 --> 01:48:00,560
um quickly uh the second is that we

2457
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:01,440
found that

2458
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:02,880
context switching between a lot of

2459
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:04,800
different systems is hard

2460
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:07,199
right um you know it's not really

2461
01:48:07,199 --> 01:48:08,400
there's a lot of

2462
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:10,719
accounting and data entry that you know

2463
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:12,560
is kind of part and parcel with instant

2464
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:15,040
response but it's not really

2465
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:16,639
effective for instance responders to

2466
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:17,600
jump through a lot of different

2467
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:18,960
interfaces a lot of different

2468
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:21,360
ticketing systems and so on and so forth

2469
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:23,440
and so we really

2470
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:26,239
pushed to centralize a lot of that uh

2471
01:48:26,239 --> 01:48:27,520
incident

2472
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:30,159
life cycle the management of it to one

2473
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:32,480
one particular place so that folks

2474
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:35,199
you know don't have to constantly be

2475
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:36,639
flipping through a million tabs

2476
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:38,560
and copying pasting data from one system

2477
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:40,480
to the other so we focus a lot on

2478
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,960
reducing the number of interfaces

2479
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:45,360
that people have to interact with and

2480
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:46,000
enter data

2481
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,320
into

2482
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:52,960
we also want to offer a consistent

2483
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:54,239
experience

2484
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:57,679
right ideally you know we are a team

2485
01:48:57,679 --> 01:48:58,880
we are going to have different people

2486
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:00,800
responding to different incidents

2487
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,560
but the last thing we would we would

2488
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:04,639
want is for one incident to be run very

2489
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:06,960
differently familiar we don't think that

2490
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:10,159
we think that consistency provides

2491
01:49:10,159 --> 01:49:13,760
people with a sense of you know trust in

2492
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:14,639
the system almost

2493
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:16,080
that they're going to be handled this is

2494
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:17,760
going to be handled appropriately and

2495
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:19,199
incorrectly

2496
01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:22,560
um and it speeds up their ability to be

2497
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,760
oriented right if we're always doing the

2498
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:24,960
same thing we're always providing the

2499
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,400
same resources

2500
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,320
uh those people start to learn that that

2501
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:29,440
that process

2502
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:32,480
and kind of can uh contribute more

2503
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:35,919
effectively uh more quickly

2504
01:49:36,159 --> 01:49:37,760
although we push for a consistent

2505
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:39,840
experience we also balance this against

2506
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:43,199
flexibility right so we do realize that

2507
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:43,920
every instance

2508
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:46,800
is unique in its own specific ways and

2509
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:47,280
so

2510
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:49,840
we do balance this consistency against

2511
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:53,119
the ability to be flexible enough

2512
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:54,880
that the participant feels empowered

2513
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:56,080
that they can go and do additional

2514
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:56,880
things so

2515
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:59,199
almost all the features within dispatch

2516
01:49:59,199 --> 01:50:00,800
are additive in nature

2517
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:02,880
um hopefully providing kind of a base

2518
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:04,639
level experience but then allowing

2519
01:50:04,639 --> 01:50:06,560
participants to go above beyond that

2520
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:08,840
what is when is necessary for the

2521
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:11,840
incident

2522
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:14,159
and then the other opportunity we have a

2523
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:14,960
lot with

2524
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:17,840
um automation is we're able to collect a

2525
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:19,199
lot of information that

2526
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:21,840
would be onerous or possible to collect

2527
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:22,239
for

2528
01:50:22,239 --> 01:50:24,080
for an individual right so there's a lot

2529
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:25,360
of data around

2530
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:28,159
who is added to an incident when um how

2531
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:28,960
long

2532
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:31,679
someone spends time on certain things

2533
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:32,800
all this information can be kind of

2534
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:34,080
collected

2535
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:36,719
by by running it through some automation

2536
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:38,000
and we can use that

2537
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,960
data to drive learnings uh back into the

2538
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:42,639
organization

2539
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:44,719
um we use this not only on a per

2540
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:45,840
incident

2541
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:48,080
basis um you know so what went wrong

2542
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:49,520
what was the root cause between this

2543
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:51,599
instant but also in the aggregate basis

2544
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:54,239
so if we can see that

2545
01:50:54,239 --> 01:50:56,480
we have certain trends throughout all of

2546
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:57,520
our incidents

2547
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:00,800
we can use that to hopefully drive a

2548
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:01,360
deeper

2549
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:04,639
and more um

2550
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:07,360
a bigger scoped uh solutions throughout

2551
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:10,000
the organization

2552
01:51:11,119 --> 01:51:12,560
and with that i'm going to actually hand

2553
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:14,400
it off to my team member

2554
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:16,320
mark and he's going to lead you through

2555
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:18,239
some of the actual features

2556
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:21,360
of dispatch itself thanks kevin um

2557
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:23,440
i think you need to stop sharing so

2558
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:26,799
again okay there you go

2559
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:35,840
let's see if i can find the right tab

2560
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:53,920
is it working can you see my slides

2561
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:56,080
what about if i do this do i go back to

2562
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:58,080
the uh

2563
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:02,400
presentation present presenter flag view

2564
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:05,280
yeah that has the presenter rugby okay

2565
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:06,639
yeah i'll just uh

2566
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:10,400
stick to this uh yeah thanks again kevin

2567
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:13,280
um so kevin gave us a quick overview of

2568
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:13,760
like

2569
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:15,440
what we're trying to achieve with

2570
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:17,280
dispatch and now i'm gonna walk you

2571
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:18,400
through

2572
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:21,679
some of the um features that we've built

2573
01:52:21,679 --> 01:52:24,560
in dispatch uh features that dispatch

2574
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:25,599
provides

2575
01:52:25,599 --> 01:52:28,880
in those kind of like categories so

2576
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:30,800
the first one we're gonna kind of like

2577
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:33,119
cover is like orientation and engagement

2578
01:52:33,119 --> 01:52:36,239
it's a very important one um

2579
01:52:36,239 --> 01:52:39,440
so the the way we allow

2580
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:42,239
uh we allow people to report incidents

2581
01:52:42,239 --> 01:52:42,719
to us

2582
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:44,320
through dispatch in different ways but

2583
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:45,840
the main one is

2584
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:49,840
a very simple uh web form

2585
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:53,360
this web form allows people to

2586
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:56,840
give us like a title for that incident a

2587
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:58,239
description uh

2588
01:52:58,239 --> 01:53:01,280
we also have a concept of like project

2589
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:03,040
within these fights so there's like

2590
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:04,400
different teams have like different

2591
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:06,080
projects with different like

2592
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:08,719
incident types and priorities so when

2593
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:10,239
people go and report they can choose

2594
01:53:10,239 --> 01:53:12,480
from like a different like project

2595
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,719
uh different like instant type priority

2596
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:16,239
they can also like specify

2597
01:53:16,239 --> 01:53:19,520
tags um on instagram creation if they

2598
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:20,480
wanna already

2599
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:22,080
if they already know like how they wanna

2600
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:24,080
attack that incident and they wanna use

2601
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:24,400
that

2602
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:28,159
later on for like filtering purposes um

2603
01:53:28,159 --> 01:53:30,080
we're always like trying to make it easy

2604
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:31,360
for people to report

2605
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:34,560
incident to us and uh we use slack at

2606
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:38,400
netflix so we also built a slash command

2607
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:42,400
that essentially like opens a model

2608
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:45,040
and allows people to essentially report

2609
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:46,480
an incident in the same way that we

2610
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:47,280
allow

2611
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:49,920
through the web

2612
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:52,320
once the incident is reported all the

2613
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:54,560
resources are created

2614
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:57,599
we start like adding people to the

2615
01:53:57,599 --> 01:53:59,119
insulin channel

2616
01:53:59,119 --> 01:54:02,080
and once we add them to the incident

2617
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:02,560
channel

2618
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:07,840
we also announce them and that happens

2619
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:10,239
as the incident light progresses like

2620
01:54:10,239 --> 01:54:11,520
new people get added

2621
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:14,159
we we announce them to the channel and

2622
01:54:14,159 --> 01:54:16,320
the reason why we do this is because

2623
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:18,719
uh it is important for other people

2624
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:19,360
already

2625
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:22,080
in the uh incident to know like who's

2626
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:23,119
joining

2627
01:54:23,119 --> 01:54:24,800
uh who they are the team that they

2628
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,960
belong to their location in case they

2629
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:27,599
need to be

2630
01:54:27,599 --> 01:54:30,639
aware of uh you know the time zone

2631
01:54:30,639 --> 01:54:32,800
i like we want to be mindful about like

2632
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:34,239
where people are and like we don't want

2633
01:54:34,239 --> 01:54:35,440
to bother them

2634
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:37,440
like off business hours if it's not

2635
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:38,560
necessary

2636
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:40,639
and then also like the the role that

2637
01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:42,400
they have in that incident

2638
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,400
is it like a participant is the reporter

2639
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:46,000
is the incident commander

2640
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:49,040
um one thing that we decided to

2641
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:52,080
not include was and you may have already

2642
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:53,360
noticed is that

2643
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:55,679
the the title that the person has at the

2644
01:54:55,679 --> 01:54:56,719
company

2645
01:54:56,719 --> 01:54:59,360
and the reason why we did this was

2646
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:00,159
because

2647
01:55:00,159 --> 01:55:03,360
uh oftentimes like people that

2648
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:06,000
are like higher up in the organization

2649
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:06,639
uh

2650
01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:10,480
tend to like um

2651
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:13,520
influence decisions and

2652
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:16,080
we don't want that to happen so we

2653
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:17,280
decided to

2654
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:20,560
not include the instant the the job the

2655
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:23,199
the job title to like avoid these like

2656
01:55:23,199 --> 01:55:25,599
power differential like issues we want

2657
01:55:25,599 --> 01:55:27,199
the incident commander to be the one

2658
01:55:27,199 --> 01:55:28,159
that

2659
01:55:28,159 --> 01:55:30,880
makes the decisions based on the context

2660
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:31,760
and the

2661
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:34,880
information that is given to to them

2662
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:36,719
by other people participating in the

2663
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:38,480
incident

2664
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:42,159
um another thing that dispatch does

2665
01:55:42,159 --> 01:55:45,599
uh is allowing us to like manage roles

2666
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:46,480
so we have

2667
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:49,520
like four different uh actually five

2668
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:50,560
different roles

2669
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:52,639
uh we have like the incident commander

2670
01:55:52,639 --> 01:55:53,840
which is the person

2671
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:56,880
uh that's responsible for like many

2672
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:58,880
managing the incident like moving it

2673
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:00,960
forward uh

2674
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:04,080
towards like resolution

2675
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:06,639
basically having all the context about

2676
01:56:06,639 --> 01:56:07,520
it

2677
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:10,080
we also have like scribe which is for

2678
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:10,719
like bigger

2679
01:56:10,719 --> 01:56:13,520
incidents like kind of like a supporting

2680
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:16,080
role for the incident commander so

2681
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:18,400
i like like about like they have like

2682
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:19,679
with taking notes

2683
01:56:19,679 --> 01:56:22,159
keeping um you know documentation up to

2684
01:56:22,159 --> 01:56:24,000
date and all of those things it's more

2685
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,599
like a supporting goal for the insulin

2686
01:56:25,599 --> 01:56:27,679
commander when things like get big

2687
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:29,280
and then some commander actually needs

2688
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:31,040
to um

2689
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:33,040
you know have conversations with like

2690
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:34,880
different like incident participants and

2691
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:35,760
doesn't

2692
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:38,239
have time to like take notes at the same

2693
01:56:38,239 --> 01:56:38,960
time so the

2694
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:40,639
scribe kind of like helps with that and

2695
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:42,960
then we'll have liaison

2696
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:46,239
uh liaison helps us with uh again like

2697
01:56:46,239 --> 01:56:47,199
when an incident

2698
01:56:47,199 --> 01:56:50,159
is like big or like it touches different

2699
01:56:50,159 --> 01:56:51,199
parts of the

2700
01:56:51,199 --> 01:56:54,080
organization there's people that are

2701
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:56,560
very positioned to

2702
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:59,679
kind of like liaise with those uh other

2703
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:01,599
parts of the organization

2704
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:03,440
then the instagram commander the

2705
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:04,880
incident commander may not

2706
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:06,960
have a lot of insight into how that

2707
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:08,480
organization works

2708
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:11,920
who to talk to so assigning someone

2709
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:14,400
the liaison role like helps us kind of

2710
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:16,159
like take care of that

2711
01:57:16,159 --> 01:57:18,480
and then we have reporter obviously the

2712
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:20,800
person that reported the incident that

2713
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:24,000
of almost never changes

2714
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,480
right and that we have like the regular

2715
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:27,920
participant

2716
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:31,119
uh role which is essentially like

2717
01:57:31,119 --> 01:57:34,000
kind of like a subject matter expert the

2718
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,239
company that can help us in a specific

2719
01:57:36,239 --> 01:57:40,400
like area that we need to like

2720
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:43,840
investigate or like resolve an issue

2721
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:46,960
um so these

2722
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:49,040
uh kind of like feature also allows us

2723
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:51,199
to

2724
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:53,199
basically do like a an incident

2725
01:57:53,199 --> 01:57:54,719
commander handoff if

2726
01:57:54,719 --> 01:57:57,119
let's say like uh the incident needs to

2727
01:57:57,119 --> 01:57:59,199
be hand up handed off to someone else we

2728
01:57:59,199 --> 01:58:00,480
can use this

2729
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:02,880
uh once we use this to hand out the

2730
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:03,679
incident

2731
01:58:03,679 --> 01:58:05,599
uh dispatch will communicate that in the

2732
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:07,679
channel so everyone knows like okay

2733
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:09,520
the new new instant commander is like

2734
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:10,960
kevin glsen

2735
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:13,199
uh we'll also change the the channel

2736
01:58:13,199 --> 01:58:14,800
topic and we'll make changes

2737
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:17,199
like in many other places so that gets

2738
01:58:17,199 --> 01:58:20,719
like kind of like reflected

2739
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:23,840
um one of the other things that dispatch

2740
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:27,440
allows us uh is to kind of like

2741
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:29,599
get help from other people at the

2742
01:58:29,599 --> 01:58:30,880
company we

2743
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:34,000
have the ability to go and

2744
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:37,599
create on-call services uh within

2745
01:58:37,599 --> 01:58:39,599
the system and then those on-call

2746
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:40,960
services then

2747
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:43,679
are available for people to use during

2748
01:58:43,679 --> 01:58:44,719
incidents so

2749
01:58:44,719 --> 01:58:47,040
you don't have to remember like oh who

2750
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,719
is the on call for like

2751
01:58:48,719 --> 01:58:52,000
um you know cert um i don't have to go

2752
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:52,960
to like a

2753
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:54,719
you know a third party system to see

2754
01:58:54,719 --> 01:58:56,000
like okay

2755
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,679
and then do some searches there to like

2756
01:58:57,679 --> 01:59:00,320
find who's the on call like we can

2757
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:04,320
we registered them we create them uh

2758
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:06,320
ahead of time and then those are

2759
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:07,440
available

2760
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:09,840
uh in this fight and we can use them

2761
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:11,840
without having to know like

2762
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:15,119
do all those extra steps um we also

2763
01:59:15,119 --> 01:59:20,719
provide the ability to page if necessary

2764
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:24,080
so let's talk a little bit about what we

2765
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:27,360
do on the communication side

2766
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:30,400
so the first thing that an insulin

2767
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:31,199
participant

2768
01:59:31,199 --> 01:59:34,639
gets when they join an incident or they

2769
01:59:34,639 --> 01:59:36,000
get added to an incident

2770
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:39,199
is what we call the welcome message and

2771
01:59:39,199 --> 01:59:42,320
this welcome message provides like uh

2772
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:45,360
information about the the incident and

2773
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:47,520
the resources that were created for that

2774
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:48,400
incident

2775
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:50,880
such as the incident title like the

2776
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:52,159
status of the incident and

2777
01:59:52,159 --> 01:59:54,239
what type of incident it is what is the

2778
01:59:54,239 --> 01:59:55,520
priority like

2779
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:58,639
do i need to like drop everything or can

2780
01:59:58,639 --> 01:59:59,679
i just like

2781
01:59:59,679 --> 02:00:01,360
work on the incident while i work on

2782
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:03,360
other things do i need to work over the

2783
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:04,960
weekend or not

2784
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:08,719
um so we try to like

2785
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:10,400
provide that information to the

2786
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:12,719
participants as they join

2787
02:00:12,719 --> 02:00:14,719
we also provide them with who the

2788
02:00:14,719 --> 02:00:16,320
incident commander is

2789
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:19,199
uh the investigation document which is

2790
02:00:19,199 --> 02:00:21,119
like a collaboration document that we

2791
02:00:21,119 --> 02:00:21,760
all use

2792
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:25,199
to like capture all the information we

2793
02:00:25,199 --> 02:00:27,760
collect uh while we investigate the

2794
02:00:27,760 --> 02:00:28,560
incident

2795
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:30,719
and many other like links to uh

2796
02:00:30,719 --> 02:00:31,840
resources that

2797
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:35,040
uh get created and allow people to like

2798
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:37,679
collaborate and work on the incident

2799
02:00:37,679 --> 02:00:41,280
so we um send this welcome message

2800
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:43,360
as an ephemeral channel ephemeral

2801
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:45,440
message to the incident channel

2802
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:49,199
so that message only is received by the

2803
02:00:49,199 --> 02:00:51,360
participant

2804
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:54,400
and then we also send it by email

2805
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:56,960
some people

2806
02:00:57,920 --> 02:00:59,599
if someone like is is not paying

2807
02:00:59,599 --> 02:01:01,360
attention to slack

2808
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:04,960
they'll get it by email as well so um

2809
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:07,199
with that we hope that we're kind of

2810
02:01:07,199 --> 02:01:09,280
like reducing the amount of time that

2811
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:11,840
it takes for people to kind of like join

2812
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:13,920
us in the instant channel and

2813
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:17,040
sound like contributing

2814
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:20,719
um we also provide like two different

2815
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:21,599
types of

2816
02:01:21,599 --> 02:01:24,960
reporting within dispatch we provide

2817
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:27,679
the ability for people to or incident

2818
02:01:27,679 --> 02:01:28,960
commanders to

2819
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:31,520
write tactical reports and executive

2820
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:32,480
reports

2821
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:34,960
tactical reports are more meant for

2822
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:35,679
people

2823
02:01:35,679 --> 02:01:37,840
directly involved in resolving the

2824
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:38,880
incident

2825
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:42,000
and so um

2826
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:45,760
these reports um essentially give you

2827
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:48,239
kind of like a snapshot of like

2828
02:01:48,239 --> 02:01:50,000
where we are within like what the

2829
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,400
conditions current conditions are

2830
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:54,159
what are the actions that need to be

2831
02:01:54,159 --> 02:01:55,599
taken and

2832
02:01:55,599 --> 02:02:00,000
if there are like any needs um um

2833
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,920
any anything that uh the insane

2834
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:04,000
commander needs from

2835
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,920
the incident participants to like move

2836
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:07,760
the incident forward

2837
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:11,760
um this this tactical report

2838
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:16,000
gets sent and pinned in the channel so

2839
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,920
if someone like joins the incident

2840
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:19,440
channel like kind of like

2841
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:22,719
at a later stage um and they're not

2842
02:02:22,719 --> 02:02:23,760
aware of like

2843
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:26,400
um what has happened until that point

2844
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:27,119
they can just

2845
02:02:27,119 --> 02:02:30,080
go and find all these like pinned uh

2846
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:31,920
tactical reports and kind of like get up

2847
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:33,199
to speed on like

2848
02:02:33,199 --> 02:02:34,639
uh everything that has happened

2849
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:36,719
everything that we've done and so

2850
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:38,239
that kind of like frees the incident

2851
02:02:38,239 --> 02:02:40,080
commander or like other people

2852
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:41,679
in the incident to like get them up to

2853
02:02:41,679 --> 02:02:43,679
speed and that's the idea right like we

2854
02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:47,199
just wanna make sure that

2855
02:02:47,199 --> 02:02:49,040
information is kind of like self-service

2856
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:51,040
here

2857
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:53,920
we also send the the same way that we do

2858
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:55,920
it with a welcome email we also do it

2859
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:57,679
with a tactical

2860
02:02:57,679 --> 02:03:01,040
report we send it by email because

2861
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:03,360
sometimes that's uh easy for people to

2862
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:05,759
consume

2863
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:07,679
uh let's talk a little bit about uh

2864
02:03:07,679 --> 02:03:09,360
lifecycle management which is

2865
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:12,080
also very important and like kevin said

2866
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:12,719
like

2867
02:03:12,719 --> 02:03:15,440
we don't want uh people to have to go to

2868
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:17,040
like multiple like systems

2869
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:19,119
like uh kind of like move the incident

2870
02:03:19,119 --> 02:03:20,239
along

2871
02:03:20,239 --> 02:03:24,239
um so with that we

2872
02:03:24,239 --> 02:03:27,920
provide um two different ways to do it

2873
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:29,040
uh we allow

2874
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:31,040
uh people to do it from slack and we

2875
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:33,199
also allow people to do it from directly

2876
02:03:33,199 --> 02:03:34,719
from the dispatch web ui

2877
02:03:34,719 --> 02:03:36,320
we don't have a screenshot of that here

2878
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,320
but uh this is kind of like the

2879
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:41,520
how the update is and like form looks

2880
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:42,159
like and

2881
02:03:42,159 --> 02:03:44,159
this allows us to like update

2882
02:03:44,159 --> 02:03:45,599
information about the incident like the

2883
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:46,080
title

2884
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:49,280
description type priorities status

2885
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:51,040
if we change the status from like active

2886
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:52,880
to stable then everything gets moved to

2887
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:56,880
stable means like hey wherever i

2888
02:04:00,480 --> 02:04:03,520
the incident like we've resolved uh most

2889
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:05,679
of the questions we had we we feel like

2890
02:04:05,679 --> 02:04:06,719
in a pretty good

2891
02:04:06,719 --> 02:04:08,480
we're in pretty good shape so we can

2892
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:10,239
move it to stable and then

2893
02:04:10,239 --> 02:04:12,000
once we're like done with everything

2894
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
including post insert review if

2895
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,599
necessary we can move it

2896
02:04:15,599 --> 02:04:18,000
to close and then dispatch uh

2897
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,440
essentially will

2898
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:21,679
take all the actions necessary to like

2899
02:04:21,679 --> 02:04:23,440
mark that incident as close and we also

2900
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:24,400
allow

2901
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:27,679
people to update tags directly

2902
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:31,440
here as well if necessary

2903
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:36,239
one of the other things that dispatch

2904
02:04:36,239 --> 02:04:37,599
provides is

2905
02:04:37,599 --> 02:04:40,239
insights into uh like incidents that

2906
02:04:40,239 --> 02:04:41,440
we've had

2907
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:44,320
and um that's uh really important for us

2908
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:45,599
because we also

2909
02:04:45,599 --> 02:04:46,880
we're kind of like a learning

2910
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:49,119
organization so like we always like try

2911
02:04:49,119 --> 02:04:49,760
to

2912
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:52,079
learn from things that have happened in

2913
02:04:52,079 --> 02:04:53,199
the past

2914
02:04:53,199 --> 02:04:56,079
so we collect a lot of information of

2915
02:04:56,079 --> 02:04:57,199
incidents and we can

2916
02:04:57,199 --> 02:04:59,280
like drive a lot of like interesting

2917
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:00,400
insights and

2918
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:02,560
here's a screenshot of like that like

2919
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:03,679
kind of like the main

2920
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:05,440
dashboard that dispatch provides you can

2921
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:06,880
see like uh

2922
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:09,280
total number of like incidents like how

2923
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:11,440
much uh those incidents

2924
02:05:11,440 --> 02:05:15,360
have cost uh the um the organization

2925
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:17,440
what the average cost per incident is

2926
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:20,799
how much time we spend

2927
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:25,759
managing an incident and then

2928
02:05:26,159 --> 02:05:29,360
charts showing like the different types

2929
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:30,400
of

2930
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:32,079
incidents that we've managed the

2931
02:05:32,079 --> 02:05:33,679
priorities they have

2932
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:36,960
so essentially we try to like we collect

2933
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:38,639
all this information and then we try to

2934
02:05:38,639 --> 02:05:40,320
present it in a way that's easy to

2935
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:41,360
consume it's

2936
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:43,679
easy to share with other people within

2937
02:05:43,679 --> 02:05:44,880
the organization

2938
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:47,920
and and that allows them and us to kind

2939
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:49,280
of like make more like informed

2940
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:51,360
decisions i'm like okay

2941
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:54,639
looks like we're having like um you know

2942
02:05:54,639 --> 02:05:56,159
this quarter we had a lot of incense of

2943
02:05:56,159 --> 02:05:57,679
this type like should we invest more

2944
02:05:57,679 --> 02:05:59,599
like researchers to make sure that

2945
02:05:59,599 --> 02:06:02,800
uh those doesn't happen or doesn't

2946
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:03,840
happen that often

2947
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:06,639
and so on and so forth so we just try to

2948
02:06:06,639 --> 02:06:07,840
like learn from

2949
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:09,920
what's happening and we're kind of like

2950
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:11,440
trying to make like better decisions

2951
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:12,320
based on

2952
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:15,040
the data that we collect uh another

2953
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:16,079
thing that dispatch

2954
02:06:16,079 --> 02:06:18,159
uh provides that's pretty interesting is

2955
02:06:18,159 --> 02:06:19,280
like we

2956
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:22,320
uh provide sections of like uh basic

2957
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:24,639
like forecasting so you can see like

2958
02:06:24,639 --> 02:06:27,440
uh how many incidents you're gonna have

2959
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:28,800
compared to the incidents

2960
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:31,199
uh instance and then you can compare

2961
02:06:31,199 --> 02:06:31,920
that with

2962
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:34,560
the incident that you actually had and

2963
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:35,440
um

2964
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:38,560
you can like um fine-tune like

2965
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:42,480
the way you want this forecast to work

2966
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:45,840
and then back to kevin uh for him to

2967
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:47,199
like give us the

2968
02:06:47,199 --> 02:06:59,839
final key takeaways

2969
02:07:02,159 --> 02:07:04,400
cool

2970
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:07,280
we'll go through all these guys that was

2971
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:08,800
great mark thank you

2972
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:12,239
okay so key takeaways um you know

2973
02:07:12,239 --> 02:07:13,760
the we really want to get people

2974
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:15,760
involved uh quickly and effectively we

2975
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:16,159
think

2976
02:07:16,159 --> 02:07:17,840
the folks that we get in the room are

2977
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:20,079
the ones um are ultimately going to be

2978
02:07:20,079 --> 02:07:21,920
able to help us resolve this information

2979
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:24,079
we do this a lot of different ways

2980
02:07:24,079 --> 02:07:26,239
dispatch does allow us to have

2981
02:07:26,239 --> 02:07:29,040
um basically business rules that and

2982
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:30,639
engage people automatically based on

2983
02:07:30,639 --> 02:07:32,560
those rules which is super helpful

2984
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:34,079
for us i always forget to you know

2985
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:35,920
involve legal in certain situations or

2986
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:36,480
hr

2987
02:07:36,480 --> 02:07:39,520
so on and so forth yeah we're on uh

2988
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:42,239
presentation mode oh sorry all right

2989
02:07:42,239 --> 02:07:43,599
presenter mode

2990
02:07:43,599 --> 02:07:45,920
let me switch it zoom doesn't tell you

2991
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:48,639
which one it is

2992
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:54,079
uh there we go

2993
02:07:54,079 --> 02:07:57,679
there you go um and we think that by

2994
02:07:57,679 --> 02:08:00,000
engaging those folks uh automatically as

2995
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,199
just another burden that the ins

2996
02:08:01,199 --> 02:08:02,239
commander doesn't have to worry about

2997
02:08:02,239 --> 02:08:02,800
which we find

2998
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:06,000
really really valuable uh

2999
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,560
providing consistent customer experience

3000
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:09,199
so

3001
02:08:09,199 --> 02:08:10,719
everyone involved in our incidents we

3002
02:08:10,719 --> 02:08:12,159
consider a customer we want to provide

3003
02:08:12,159 --> 02:08:12,800
them a

3004
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:15,360
consistent experience uh it reduces

3005
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:16,480
stress

3006
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:19,119
um and it doesn't it ensures that we can

3007
02:08:19,119 --> 02:08:20,480
actually learn from these organizations

3008
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:22,239
across incidents because we have

3009
02:08:22,239 --> 02:08:24,480
a consistent experience and the data we

3010
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:27,678
collect is consistent as well

3011
02:08:28,239 --> 02:08:30,719
we allow electrical management from the

3012
02:08:30,719 --> 02:08:31,920
actual instant channel again we don't

3013
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:33,280
want folks to have to

3014
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:34,239
interact with a bunch of different

3015
02:08:34,239 --> 02:08:36,880
places forget to enter data one place

3016
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:38,719
or have to remember all that cognitive

3017
02:08:38,719 --> 02:08:40,719
load really just isn't useful to

3018
02:08:40,719 --> 02:08:42,079
actually resolving the incident so we

3019
02:08:42,079 --> 02:08:43,040
want to reduce that

3020
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:46,000
as much as possible

3021
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:49,280
um and then collecting data so mark just

3022
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:50,560
talked about how

3023
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:51,760
you know we're really really data

3024
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:53,760
focused we think that by

3025
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:56,079
tracking data that both the commander

3026
02:08:56,079 --> 02:08:57,679
inputs as well as we collect

3027
02:08:57,679 --> 02:08:58,719
automatically

3028
02:08:58,719 --> 02:09:00,639
we can drive a lot of really good

3029
02:09:00,639 --> 02:09:02,239
learnings from these incidents and we

3030
02:09:02,239 --> 02:09:05,839
can help prevent them in the future

3031
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:08,079
and then lastly here i just want to take

3032
02:09:08,079 --> 02:09:10,159
a moment and

3033
02:09:10,159 --> 02:09:12,320
say that uh it really takes a village

3034
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:13,679
right so we're very

3035
02:09:13,679 --> 02:09:15,119
kind of customer focused in the way we

3036
02:09:15,119 --> 02:09:16,840
approach incidents we're a very small

3037
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:18,320
team

3038
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:19,920
as far as the number of incidents and

3039
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:21,360
the breadth of incidents that we do

3040
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:23,440
handle so we really rely on our partner

3041
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:24,400
teams

3042
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:26,960
to help us resolve all these those

3043
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:29,360
incidents

3044
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:31,920
and additionally the automation that

3045
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:33,360
we've we've kind of

3046
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:35,840
created has the added benefit of

3047
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:37,599
offloading some of our instant workload

3048
02:09:37,599 --> 02:09:38,800
right so

3049
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:40,400
with this automation we can basically

3050
02:09:40,400 --> 02:09:42,639
say hey other security team

3051
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:44,159
uh if you use this automation we have

3052
02:09:44,159 --> 02:09:45,920
some reasonable expectation that the

3053
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:46,880
incident will be handled

3054
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:49,040
in a reasonable manner and that's helped

3055
02:09:49,040 --> 02:09:50,320
us a lot with some of those partner

3056
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:51,520
teams that can run

3057
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:53,679
either incidents very specific to their

3058
02:09:53,679 --> 02:09:55,440
team or their

3059
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:57,679
part of their organization or their very

3060
02:09:57,679 --> 02:09:59,440
just low level incidents that

3061
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:02,560
so we can kind of reserve our cognitive

3062
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:05,199
overhead for maybe bigger or more

3063
02:10:05,199 --> 02:10:07,599
involved incidents

3064
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:11,440
um what we've also been able to do

3065
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:13,760
is offer this tooling outside of uh

3066
02:10:13,760 --> 02:10:14,719
security teams and

3067
02:10:14,719 --> 02:10:17,440
to other teams within netflix so while

3068
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:18,880
uh we developed this for the security

3069
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:19,520
use case

3070
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:22,719
it's also there's nothing very security

3071
02:10:22,719 --> 02:10:24,400
like specific about any of the things

3072
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:26,800
dispatch does it's really about

3073
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:28,560
maybe instant management and we found

3074
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:30,560
that there are a lot of other teams

3075
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:32,320
within netflix that find this very very

3076
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:32,880
useful

3077
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:35,280
to help them run their own business type

3078
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:38,000
incidents and so we've been able to

3079
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,960
help them uh as well the added benefit

3080
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:42,000
to this is that become more

3081
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,079
familiar with with our tooling and so if

3082
02:10:44,079 --> 02:10:45,760
we do need to involve them in security

3083
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:46,719
specific instance

3084
02:10:46,719 --> 02:10:48,800
they already know what what the deal is

3085
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:50,159
they're already up to speed

3086
02:10:50,159 --> 02:10:51,840
um and it speeds up that process a lot

3087
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:53,360
so there's kind of a mutual beneficial

3088
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:57,839
relationship there

3089
02:10:58,079 --> 02:11:00,560
and then lastly uh it's open source uh

3090
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:01,599
go ahead and try it out

3091
02:11:01,599 --> 02:11:03,440
uh i think it's been open source for a

3092
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:04,960
little over a year now

3093
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:08,400
um and and and that's that's all we have

3094
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:10,079
so thank you very much for for talking

3095
02:11:10,079 --> 02:11:11,440
with us today

3096
02:11:11,440 --> 02:11:13,040
yeah thank you very much and thank you

3097
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:15,520
olivier for

3098
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:18,880
introducing us thank you

3099
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:21,119
gentlemen and thanks to netflix for

3100
02:11:21,119 --> 02:11:23,199
offering your tools on github on the

3101
02:11:23,199 --> 02:11:24,800
open source

3102
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:26,639
let me put some phases here on one thing

3103
02:11:26,639 --> 02:11:27,840
you mentioned that's

3104
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:31,199
the incident tactical report with the

3105
02:11:31,199 --> 02:11:34,560
can that summarizes current status of an

3106
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:35,920
incident

3107
02:11:35,920 --> 02:11:38,000
as a reminder the ca cn acronym stands

3108
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,239
for conditions actions and needs

3109
02:11:40,239 --> 02:11:42,639
and it comes from the firefighter world

3110
02:11:42,639 --> 02:11:44,000
so that's uh i would say that's a

3111
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,360
reference and that's a

3112
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:48,159
an excellent choice i would say uh that

3113
02:11:48,159 --> 02:11:50,639
said two final suggestions for attendees

3114
02:11:50,639 --> 02:11:52,000
so the first is to go to the

3115
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:55,040
work adventure for the q a room to ask

3116
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:57,040
your questions to both of you

3117
02:11:57,040 --> 02:11:59,760
and second is once again to go to your

3118
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:00,960
netflix open source

3119
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:03,599
on github and you'll find also a very

3120
02:12:03,599 --> 02:12:04,639
interesting

3121
02:12:04,639 --> 02:12:07,840
introducing dispatch blog post uh both

3122
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:10,560
of you have been posting uh

3123
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:13,280
well a year and a half ago or so on the

3124
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:15,280
netflix tech blog uh

3125
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:18,639
also a good good site to uh to look at

3126
02:12:18,639 --> 02:12:20,400
from time to time so because there are

3127
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:22,000
quite often very interesting tools

3128
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,199
especially for

3129
02:12:23,199 --> 02:12:26,000
incidence responders that said at the

3130
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,520
end of the sessions

3131
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:30,320
for today i was a program committee

3132
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:31,199
member and

3133
02:12:31,199 --> 02:12:33,760
i can also suggest you to consider

3134
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:34,800

3136
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:38,800
the work of the

3137
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:40,960
program committee was a bit tricky as

3138
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:41,920
you might expect

3139
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:45,280
and i would like to pay tribute to the

3140
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:48,239
program committee chair who was natsuki

3141
02:12:48,239 --> 02:12:49,599
inui she did a really

3142
02:12:49,599 --> 02:12:53,440
excellent job and uh so that's all for

3143
