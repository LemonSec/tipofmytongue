1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:02,480
that's the it's the after party that's

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,400
the after party it's an eight bit

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,200
hacker style after party and you are

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:07,839
invited

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,320
oh wait this is the this is the uh

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,040
avatar

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,719
thing that brings us as close as

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,880
possible what it's like

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,039
i confess i don't like these things

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,720
usually and this one's pretty good like

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,240
when you walk up to someone the screen

12
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,600
comes up and then

13
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,439
and the voice comes up and you can have

14
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,279
a chat um

15
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,359
and then right it seems weird

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,320
but okay well the whole world is weird

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,559
now

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,960
no it's just you aaron i know

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,360
okay and uh matilda nice to meet you

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,239

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,920
hi you've never met the epic matilda

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,760
well not not like this no okay

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,039
hey martin nice to meet nice to meet you

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,199
nice to meet you in person all right

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,839
we're about to go live here

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,560
okay you all have first backgrounds

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,000
what's going on

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,040
yeah you didn't get the memo i don't

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,439
know

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,119
lucas luke is the only one who's allowed

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,360
to have uh a plaintiff ariana or sasha

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,560
don't betray me on that

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,840
okay dude you and me we'll stick

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840
together

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,040
the appropriate guinness poster sasha

36
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,720
don't don't kid yourself

37
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,439
uh so i've been updating right i think i

38
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,799
will be updating my backgrounds they

39
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,400
were all steampunk

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,280
and steampunk gestures before but now

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,960
like

42
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,600
steampunktron is a thing

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,200
and um uh cyberpunk

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,880
right like some great there's some great

45
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,040
visual backgrounds for that

46
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,360
so i'm maybe changing my thing cyberpunk

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,840
stuff might be just too sibery

48
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,479
but steampunktron is apparently a thing

49
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:09,840
and get some cool images

50
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,319
hi everyone it's just me a couple more

51
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,599
minutes we're just getting a couple

52
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,640
technical things

53
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,720
set up here and then we will be starting

54
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,280
the session

55
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,680
so do we i i was a little confused do we

56
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,680
have a half hour an hour

57
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,520
uh one hour yeah hour but if you decide

58
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,200
to do a shorter panel to have more time

59
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,120
for q a you can so

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,640
the good thing is you won't run out of

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,400
time

62
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,920
and you have flexibility well i bet with

63
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,200
this group we could probably talk for

64
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,120
two or three

65
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,400
uh you know totally unscripted so easily

66
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,920
yeah sorry about that i somehow mixed

67
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,519
that up i thought we only had a half

68
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,640
hour session

69
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,480
um but now everyone can just

70
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,400
saunter through their presentations in a

71
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,879
very relaxed and casual style

72
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,720
all right thank you everyone for waiting

73
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
there patiently uh welcome back

74
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,360
let's go ahead and get started um i want

75
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,720
to first turn it over

76
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,440
to our sponsor as a thank you our gold

77
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,200
sponsor here

78
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,399
and play a quick video

79
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
yeah i used to ruin the curve in high

80
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,280
school

81
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,319
but now i'm ruining hackers evil plans

82
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,159
see i'm the one in that room most are

83
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,760
too afraid to go in

84
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,879
fending off cyber threats day and night

85
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,680
because i use secure work stages so i'm

86
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,239
here

87
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,480
working to keep our data safe keep our

88
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,560
emails from becoming virus portals

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,720
and making sure our clients information

90
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,400
doesn't get hacked to pieces

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,040
and sold on the dark web and i'm not

92
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:01,840
going anywhere

93
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,799
all right with that i'll turn it over to

94
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,720
our moderator uh martin

95
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,519

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,120
session today i really only have one

99
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,600
little item before we get started that

100

101
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,519
will happen in work adventure

102
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,840
which is uh the 2d virtual social

103
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,680
platform of the conference

104
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,280
and that is also the same place where

105
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,040
you can find all of our exhibitors and

106
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,080
lots of other

107
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,560
fun activities and the q a will happen

108
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,320
there in room 2.

109
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,040
with that i am very very excited today

110
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,360
to

111
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,680
introduce the panel towards real world

112
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,720
cyber risk

113
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,560
which will talk about a probabilistic

114
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,240
approach to risk management for

115
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,440
vulnerabilities

116
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,919
and with that i'm really eager to hand

117
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,120
this panel over

118
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,759
to the good hands of erin leverett who

119
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,680
is a senior scientist

120
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,720
with airbus has done lots of r d about

121
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,040
cyber risk insurance and digital

122
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,960
forensics and incident response

123
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,199
and who in first is probably most well

124
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,800
known for court sharing

125
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,080
the insurance sig and the epss sig

126
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
so with that aaron i'll hand it over to

127
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,680
you

128
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,479
thanks very much martin um and likewise

129
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:14,880
i'm

130
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,360
super excited to introduce to you this

131
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,919
panel

132
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,240
um putting it bluntly the the work that

133
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,919
i will present with matilda

134
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,840
was inspired by the two pieces of work

135
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,960
that you'll see come after our

136
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,160
presentation

137
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,919
um we've also just been informed that we

138
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,280
have a little bit more time for this

139
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,960
panel than we expected so

140
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,199
we each have repaired uh 10 minutes of

141
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,039
content it might be a little bit more

142
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,479
now which is great

143
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,600
um on three different papers

144
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,080
that really capture quantitative cyber

145
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,199
risk in unique and

146
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,560
interesting ways and i think very

147
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,560
practical ways that incident responders

148
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,759
can use so

149
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,400
um without further ado i'll get us

150
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,600
started

151
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,960
and introduce you to the broad topic so

152
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,880
the core of today's question will be how

153
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,960
can we reduce uncertainty about

154
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,479
upcoming vulnerabilities and

155
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,400
exploitation and the goal here was

156
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,840
really to get predictive

157
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,919
about these different things not not

158
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,199
just to

159
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,520
be reactive and think about how these

160
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,039
things will affect us once we have more

161
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,080
information but

162
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,840
how much can we learn from the data in

163
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,319
advance of an attack

164
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,560
so here are your panelists i give you

165
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,440
their

166
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,280
twitter accounts so that you can follow

167
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,800
them and tweet along and

168
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,120
get involved i certainly follow each of

169
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,639
these people for obvious reasons

170
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,720
and you know they keep calm and pay

171
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,000
attention i mean it

172
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,600
right we're going to try and go through

173
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,759
an academic paper in 10 minutes and then

174
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,319
another one

175
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,919
in 10 minutes and then another one in 10

176
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,600
minutes and if i'm really honest

177
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,199
not all of these are just a single

178
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,360
academic paper like jay and sasha are

179
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,440
going to present epss

180
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,800
which they've been working on for quite

181
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,120
a long time and lots of ongoing work

182
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,360
and luca too has many more papers to his

183
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,039
name so

184
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,960
pay attention we won't waste your time

185
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,479
we won't fill it with a lot of this

186
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,360
nonsense so moving on

187
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,520
so we're talking about vulnerability

188
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,360
centric risk quantification today

189
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,280
there's a lot of ways we can frame cyber

190
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,199
risk but we want to focus on the

191
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,960
vulnerability and its journey

192
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,039
right how many vulnerabilities will come

193
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,080
out next year

194
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,400
how many of those uh will have exploits

195
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,120
written

196
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,960
and which ones will eventually be

197
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,400
exploited in

198
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
in the wild and how heavy might that

199
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,000
exploitation be that's all of the topics

200
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,440
that we'll talk about today

201
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,400
um and not any you know any

202
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,080
vulnerability that you can think of i

203
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,199
think of this as like a sort of

204
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,720
eigenvulnerability let's say

205
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,240
there's a vulnerability coming out next

206
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,880
week we don't know anything about it

207
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,240
how much could we learn by looking at

208
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,680
other vulnerabilities and i think that's

209
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,880
a useful frame

210
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,960
for this uh conversation today and the

211
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,880
point is that not all vulnerabilities or

212
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,800
exploits are created equal

213
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,199
they're not equally exploited all the

214
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,639
distributions that you'll see here today

215
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,120
are pretty

216
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,440
awesome and extreme so if you like

217
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,800
vulnerability nerd stuff

218
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,319
here we go so let's get started the

219
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,039
first project

220
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,240
that we're talking about is is

221
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,960
vulnerability forecast matilda and i

222
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,240
have been working on this for about a

223
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,720
year there's still more work to be done

224
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,720
and the gist of it is can we predict the

225
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,039
volume of vulnerabilities that will come

226
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:07,360
out

227
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,319
in the coming year so i'll turn it over

228
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:10,879
to

229
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,360
matilda who's been the best science and

230
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,400
lab partner

231
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,639
over the last year to get us started on

232
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,199
this particular topic

233
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,720
thanks erin um so yeah so we can start

234
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,280
just by looking at the data so the goal

235
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,560
of this project

236
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,240
um was to see if we could predict

237
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,719
um the number of cves that might be

238
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,440
coming out

239
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,519
in the next months the next six months

240
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,000
the next 12 months even

241
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,880
and then also dig deeper into whether we

242
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,760
could predict

243
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,480
uh particular subsets of cves so on the

244
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,160
left hand side you can see

245
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,920
um a graph just giving you the total

246
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,600
number of cves that we've seen

247
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,680
in the um national vulnerability

248
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,440
database um since

249
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,959
from 2002 to 2020 and as you can see

250
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,000
there's this huge uh

251
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,360
jump around 2017 and it would be very

252
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,880
useful for

253
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,160
a lot of people if they could um

254
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,680
predict these numbers as a kind of

255
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,680
weather vein of how many vulnerabilities

256
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,880
to expect um

257
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,680
in in the upcoming year particularly uh

258
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,120
because that's how most people

259
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,080
make their budget um and then on the

260
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,000
right hand side we can see

261
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,040
um a graph just showing you the top five

262
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,120
uh products uh from 2015 to 2021

263
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,360
um and what you can see is that not only

264
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,560
do these projects

265
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,800
uh products sorry change over time but

266
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,760
also the

267
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,480
proportion of the total number of cves

268
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:36,959
that they

269
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,480
take up changes over time um so it's

270
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,680
quite a kind of

271
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,080
challenge to predict some of these and

272
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,839
there are certain subsets that

273
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,240
are not going to be predictable and we

274
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,519
need that from the outset

275
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,519
and part of this project was figuring

276
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,600
out which um

277
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
types of cves could be predicted within

278
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,360
a generic framework and which

279
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,519
um wouldn't be suited to that kind of

280
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,480
approach

281
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,880
um so i think the next slide maybe

282
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,480
please

283
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,320
um unless you've got anything to add to

284
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,079
that one aaron

285
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,839
yeah i will roll back just for a moment

286
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,600
just to say you know our goal was

287
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,959
uncertainty reduction and there's a lot

288
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,160
of things you could predict when you

289
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,079
hear the word predict or forecast

290
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,760
you might think like we were predicting

291
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,360
that this particular organization was

292
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,480
going to get exploited by this

293
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,519
particular

294
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,040
vulnerability that's not something we

295
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,640
can do maybe some others are looking at

296
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,560
that research we were just looking at

297
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,800
the volume of cves that are coming out

298
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,000
on a yearly basis or

299
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,760
on a quarterly basis there are a couple

300
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,040
other great papers that

301
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,360
framed that problem before and one of

302
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,600
the challenges was that the data

303
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,120
from a time series forecasting

304
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,959
perspective looked like three months

305
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,480
might be the limit because of the kind

306
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,800
of correlation effect and noise floor

307
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,079
so that's why we were excited when we

308
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,920
were able to do it for a slightly longer

309
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,440
time frame but yeah just reframing this

310
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:51,680
is

311
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,760
how can we use the data to see how many

312
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,980
vulnerabilities will come out

313
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,279
[Music]

314
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,360
which one of the two models do you want

315
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,279
to do matilda

316
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,040
i can talk about a q theory model so um

317
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,279
we looked at some of the metadata that

318
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,560
is um

319
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,680
uh you can download from nvd and also

320
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,720
from mitre who are

321
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,880
who are feeding into the nvd but the

322
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
data they're producing is slightly

323
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,600
different

324
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,920
and how we could combine this

325
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,839
information together with the

326
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,680
total volume that you see over different

327
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,200
time periods

328
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,519
in order to do prediction and there were

329
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,680
a couple of uh models we came up with

330
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,600
that were inspired purely from this

331
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,640
metadata

332
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,360
and so the first one um i'm going to

333
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:35,920
talk about

334
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,519
is a q theory model so

335
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,800
every cve has a date that the entry was

336
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,640
created in the database

337
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,640
which is prior to the date that it was

338
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,079
published so

339
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,040
this is a kind of leading indicator as

340
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,519
to

341
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,720
how many cves we might expect and the

342
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,320
problem we had then was how can we

343
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,560
predict uh when they get published

344
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,839
um and we use little's law um

345
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,519
which is uh designed to predict the size

346
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,160
of the queue

347
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,760
based on the arrival um rate and the

348
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,639
wait time

349
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,519
and modified it slightly in order to fit

350
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,440
our needs so instead of figuring out the

351
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,600
size of the queue we wanted to estimate

352
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,880
um what is the rate at which um

353
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,639
items that enter the queue are exiting

354
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,320
the queue so this

355
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,560
like small equation below is showing how

356
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,680
we modified it

357
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,639
um so we looked at the probability that

358
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,800
the wait time is going to be less than

359
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,399
the time that we're trying to predict

360
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,120
ahead and this model was surprisingly

361
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,040
successful at predicting

362
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,560
long-term volumes of cves

363
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,959
particularly up to up to one year in

364
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,040
advance

365
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,519
and erin can talk about the other model

366
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,880
we developed

367
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,560
the serial number prediction yeah and

368
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,160
then just to queue you up for

369
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,839
when i finish as well maybe we can say a

370
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,760
little bit more about what we use as a

371
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,959
score for success

372
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,560
the prediction intervals and how we

373
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,040
tested some of these things but um

374
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,880
matilda is of course very professional

375
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,440
very clean cut and describes her

376
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,639
q theory approach uh in a very robust

377
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,360
way

378
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,720
i think of it a little bit like a wine

379
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,320
cellar right you know the amount of wine

380
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,600
bottles that are going in

381
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,440
you know the amount that first attendees

382
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,279
drink then you can probably

383
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,279
imagine the exit rate of bottles to the

384
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,320
recycling

385
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,040
um bin um and of course if you have any

386
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,880
of two of those parameters you could you

387
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,240
could estimate the other ones right like

388
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,880
if you know

389
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,240
how many bottles are being drunk and how

390
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,760
many bottles are arriving you can figure

391
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,279
out how many are in the wine cellar

392
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,560
or if you know how much is in the wine

393
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,399
cellar and how many are being drunk then

394
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,000
you can figure out how quickly they must

395
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,519
be arriving

396
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,600
so that's the advantage of q theory and

397
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,360
part of the reason that we we use that

398
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,639
approach was

399
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,079
the first kind of breakthrough that we

400
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,600
had was that the serial number

401
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,120
prediction

402
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,720
would allow us to extend past that

403
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,320
three-month window that i was telling

404
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,040
you about

405
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,639
so you we'll show you in a little while

406
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,240
some graphs of variance that'll explain

407
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,760
why that three-month

408
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,079
challenge was a was a hurdle but

409
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,240
essentially serial number prediction

410
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,120
is um it comes from from history there

411
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,399
was a point in time where

412
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,920
uh the allies wanted to estimate the

413
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,160
number of tanks that were being produced

414
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,480
by

415
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,360
the axis in world war ii and they were

416
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,160
um

417
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,000
capturing tanks and recording the serial

418
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,760
numbers and so the math of this is

419
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,360
really quite old

420
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,880
but essentially what we do is we take

421
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,639
the cve year

422
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,279
and the cve id and decompose it as a

423
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,720
string

424
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,279
many people think that the cve year is

425
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,800
the date of publication but it's the

426
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,839
date of assignment

427
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,519
and you can find that documented i think

428
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,720
jay was actually one of the first people

429
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,839
to point that out to me

430
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,760
but if you look at a lot of cves you

431
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,199
don't necessarily see that until you

432
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,560
look at enough of them

433
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
and then you notice that it's the year

434
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,839
of assignment

435
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,680
and if you decompose that id then of

436
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,279
course that's a serial number and you

437
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,519
can look for the max of that id

438
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,040
um and then you just have to correct for

439
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,560
the number of observations the number of

440
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,480
publications that you've seen this year

441
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,079
and of course there's some small

442
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,920
difference from this serial number

443
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,959
prediction

444
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,720
and the number that are actually

445
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,320
published not everything that goes into

446
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,240
the cve pipeline gets published

447
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,360
so i think of this serial number

448
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,199
prediction kind of like a lottery so if

449
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,040
you need a metaphor for describing this

450
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,360
the q theory is the kind of wine cellar

451
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,199
version the serial number prediction is

452
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:13,920
kind of like

453
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,560
if there was a lottery in a small town

454
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,760
and you didn't know the population in

455
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,120
town but you knew everyone bought a

456
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,760
ticket

457
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,680
then each year that someone won you

458
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,880
could record the number

459
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,160
and some years that number would be

460
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,399
higher than others and as you

461
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,320
extend that over time you would start to

462
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,759
get closer and closer

463
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,800
to the the population of that

464
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,959
neighboring city so kind of lottery

465
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,199
prediction and wine cellar prediction

466
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,120
um are the metaphors i like to use

467
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,639
because i'm not as

468
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,839
professional as my colleague matilda

469
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,600
um so maybe we should say a little bit

470
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,440
more about how we tested these and their

471
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,079
their predictive value

472
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,959
yeah so um we obviously have got two

473
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,560
models here um

474
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,079
why do we have two models well partly

475
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,360
because there are two of us and we were

476
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,720
arguing about it and

477
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
that was the fun of doing this research

478
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,199
um but how could we figure out who was

479
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,480
winning the ultimate battle of

480
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,040
predicting the total number of cves

481
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,560
and we had to develop some kind of

482
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,720
testing methodology

483
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,560
and a straightforward validation we

484
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,079
could use was just imagine that we're

485
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,360
sometime in the past

486
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,360
try and predict how many cves come out

487
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,399
in the next year

488
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,720
and then compare that to the real value

489
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,519
and then

490
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,959
repeatedly do this over time to see how

491
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,800
the models performed and we called this

492
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,279
kind of retro casting back in time

493
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,120
and then the metric we used in order to

494
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,959
benchmark the models against each other

495
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,240
was the prediction

496
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,519
interval at 95 percent confidence so

497
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,880
um one model might predict um

498
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,120
a thousand cves coming out in the next

499
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,279
month or 20 000 coming out in the next

500
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:47,759
year

501
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,320
and then with a plus or minus prediction

502
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:50,880
interval

503
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,160
of a thousand or 500 and in that case

504
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,519
we'd go with the model that

505
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,839
uh chose the prediction interval of 500

506
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,160
because it had had a better historic

507
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,839
performance at getting the the right

508
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,480
value

509
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,640
and so we analyzed a lot of models not

510
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,160
just these two but we found that these

511
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,559
two

512
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,079
enhanced all of the machine learning

513
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,520
models that we played with from that

514
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,599
point on

515
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,079
all right so using that approach

516
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,119
yeah so this is a little diagram on the

517
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,199
left hand side of the approach um

518
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,760
that i just described of retro casting

519
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,959
so

520
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,400
we can't use the serial predictor or the

521
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
queuing theory model for

522
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,360
predicting subtypes of cves because even

523
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,559
though we know the

524
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,760
arrival date of the cve beforehand we

525
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,960
don't know which

526
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,000
product it refers to necessarily so we

527
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,799
do still have to use that volumetric

528
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,160
historic data but we were able to use

529
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,960
the

530
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,280
indicators from the serial predictor and

531
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,400
queuing theory

532
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,240
as features into the machine learning

533
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,679
models so

534
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,600
the top graph of these three stacked on

535
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,880
the left is showing

536
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,679
um how the models were performing

537
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,840
historically

538
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,160
when we trained like a few hundred of

539
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,880
them

540
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,160
because machine learning models have

541
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,919
many parameters and

542
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,080
the best way to find the best one is

543
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,360
just to have a go

544
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,480
um up for debate about that later um and

545
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,039
then

546
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,480
the next graph down shows when we

547
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,880
refined out the best hyper parameter

548
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,799
choices for each of the models against

549
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,000
our statistic models

550
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,400
and then in the end we we cut down to a

551
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,320
single model and these orange bands here

552
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,280
are showing the

553
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,039
the prediction interval around the

554
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,320
historic prediction

555
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,400
and then how far we had to kind of

556
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,160
predict into the future

557
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,360
um one whole year later um and then how

558
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,720
well the true

559
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,480
prediction was against against our

560
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,720
interval and then the right hand side

561
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,039
just

562
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,080
shows um how we

563
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,160
use this methodology to choose a

564
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,720
different model each time because

565
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,000
data changes over time the way that

566
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,039
mitre operates changes over time

567
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,160
um and therefore different models um

568
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,400
are different are more or less

569
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,000
appropriate at different points in time

570
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,440
and the black line is showing you the

571
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,280
true number and then the orange line is

572
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,799
showing you what would happen if we just

573
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,720
used last year's number um because that

574
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,840
was the kind of

575
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,799
straw man that we needed to beat the

576
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,679
kind of dummy

577
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,240
model so as you can see um this approach

578
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,520
was was beating

579
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,080
um you know just taking the previous

580
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,640
value

581
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,240
and therefore we are making like some

582
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,840
improvement on on

583
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,720
the baseline essentially like if you

584
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,200
know if

585
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,280
all of your models just predict the the

586
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,799
mean of the previous two years if you

587
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,080
don't beat the mean

588
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,760
then you're not really using a predictor

589
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,600
so we set that as our like initial goal

590
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,559
condition

591
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,320
and then each time we got a model that

592
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,240
was better we would set that as a new

593
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,240
goal condition so okay this one has got

594
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,280
a prediction interval that's you know

595
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,799
like a thousand or this one's got a

596
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,480
prediction interval that's 200 or

597
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,200
whatever

598
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,520
um and once we extended the the window

599
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,320
out to a year

600
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,240
as you can see we predicted uh or the

601
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,600
algorithms predicted that there would be

602
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,320
15

603
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,080
663 and there were 16 160

604
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,120
and that's a repeatable sort of process

605
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,720
we were pretty happy because we think if

606
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,320
you're trying to plan patching

607
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,240
uh over the coming year that that's good

608
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,760
enough for most risk managers to work

609
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,360
with they can handle an uncertainty of

610
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,400
plus or minus

611
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,120
um five percent um and and just to

612
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,640
stress what matilda was saying about the

613
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,080
changing of the models

614
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,280
if you remember the serial number

615
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,080
predictor and the um queuing theory

616
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,440
one of the reasons like when we first

617
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,640
found the serial number prediction that

618
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,000
was great because that extended us

619
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,080
beyond that kind of three-month window

620
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,720
but you know we realized that if you

621
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,559
predict in june you're only predicting

622
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,440
up until christmas

623
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,799
right so you're not really getting a

624
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,159
year's prediction and that's where we

625
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,840
needed to turn to little's law

626
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,240
um to build another model that it could

627
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,039
extend

628
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,760
over the over the christmas period but i

629
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,120
think that that process is also

630
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,559
illustrative of why we

631
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,320
change models at different times of year

632
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,559
and why some models perform different

633
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,600
at different times of year

634
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,679
so one of the challenges or one of the

635
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:02,640
things that we really wanted to get

636
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,039
across

637
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,440
previous research has really focused on

638
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,799
that three month window

639
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,480
and and why did that exist if you do a

640
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,919
decomposition in time

641
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,799
series analysis and you look at

642
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,799
de-trending and first order differencing

643
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,000
of the time series

644
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,679
you would see something like the red

645
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,080
line in the graph on the top right

646
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,840
and basically that variance is really

647
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,080
really high and it makes it difficult to

648
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,559
predict

649
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,000
how many vulnerabilities will come out

650
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,679
next month

651
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,559
but when we looked at things on slightly

652
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,640
larger time scales like quarters

653
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,280
um or even years then the variance

654
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,520
reduces so years is green in that graph

655
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,320
up at the top um and that means that you

656
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,760
know the serial number predictor

657
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,280
that we found when that extended the

658
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,600
window up to a year

659
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,440
it became very obvious to us that we

660
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,360
could get a lower variance and a higher

661
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,320
accuracy

662
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
by looking at a longer time window and i

663
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,520
personally have never seen a

664
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,840
a problem like that in forecasting that

665
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,840
was easier to predict

666
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,760
or you were more accurate in your yearly

667
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,960
predictions than you might be in your

668
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,679
monthly

669
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,440
um but that's what happened here

670
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,440
anything i've left out matilda

671
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,559
no all good okay

672
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,039
um so you know you can see that we can

673
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:11,600
predict

674
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,679
a volume of products within a reasonable

675
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,600
accuracy that patch managers might use

676
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,000
or

677
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,080
or other risk professionals might use

678
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,679
for a variety of different reasons

679
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,120
um i do want to point out you know

680
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,640
having come from an ics and scada

681
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,080
background sometimes you want to air gap

682
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,880
things you want to

683
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,120
isolate things or you can't patch them

684
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,799
so it's not just useful for figuring out

685
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,159
how big should my patch team

686
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,159
be next year it's also useful for

687
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,080
questions like if i don't patch this

688
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,120
thing for two years

689
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,039
how many vulnerabilities might i see in

690
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,280
that time period

691
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,880
but getting back to this core point like

692
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,640
why can't we do all the products

693
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,840
not all the products decompose um in the

694
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,360
in the correct way to be able to use

695
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,960
these same approaches uh

696
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,799
as matilda said we can't use the serial

697
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,240
number predictor on this because we're

698
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,280
doing subsets of the total number

699
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,480
there might be some work that can be

700
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,320
done there in the future by others if

701
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,840
you knew the top and the bottom of the

702
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,720
cve ids for a certain product

703
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,320
but the main reasons are that sample

704
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,679
sizes are too small for some

705
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,960
vulnerabilities we've never seen them

706
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,760
before

707
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,919
there's only five of them we can't do a

708
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,760
lot of statistical analysis

709
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,840
also different patch release cadences so

710
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,120
when you try and match

711
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,080
correlation for oracle for example

712
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,559
products

713
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,159
that's three months in the past because

714
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,919
they patch on their quarterly basis

715
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,280
instead of a monthly

716
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,360
so it can't be detrended doesn't pass an

717
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,120
augmented ticket fuller test

718
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,480
and it might be predictable but the

719
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,640
uncertainty is too high the good news is

720
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,600
about 48

721
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,080
products do have potential for volume

722
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,159
forecasting in these ways

723
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,520
and we'd love to work on some other

724
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,280
things such as

725
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,080
can you predict the cvss score turns out

726
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,640
that's highly dependent on the product

727
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,039
it's also highly dependent on type type

728
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,880
is particular challenge because it's

729
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,000
mostly written up in natural

730
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,279
language forms for example a cross-site

731
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,640
scripting vulnerability

732
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,159
might not be appropriate in certain

733
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,600
programming languages or certain

734
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,320
products

735
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,120
so even though it makes up you know 12

736
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,919
or something of

737
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,840
all cdes that doesn't mean it would be

738
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,600
12 of the given

739
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,039
random cve that you're thinking about

740
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,720
so on the right we have one of our one

741
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,720
of our predictions and

742
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,720
matilda do you want to say anything more

743
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,480
about this particular slide before i go

744
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,679
on

745
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,559
well no i think i'm conscious of time

746
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,440
and i want to hear

747
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,880
you know make sure we hear from the rest

748
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,799
of the panel and um

749
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,480
this is just our kind of forecast um

750
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,919
taken like back last year um against the

751
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,679
kind of mean of the last two years and

752
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,240
yeah please come and ask us about it

753
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,320
yeah i'll say a little bit more about

754
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,840
the graph on the left and then i'm keen

755
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,120
to hand over to everybody else as well

756
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,440
but

757
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,200
that's the accuracy graph so you can see

758
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,120
the graph on the left is kind of a

759
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,240
longer time view

760
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,400
of what on the right is a snapshot in

761
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,480
time on the left is kind of how did it

762
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,200
perform

763
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,520
and the dotted lines are our predictions

764
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,640
and then the

765
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,159
uh solid colored lines are the actual

766
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:58,799
results

767
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,159
and the reason those shorter ones down

768
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,000
below is that's the that's the one year

769
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,679
prediction the six months the three

770
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,279
month and the one month

771
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,799
and that's why they're different lengths

772
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,320
but that's us and um

773
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,679
i want to remind you that our

774
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,840
presentation uh today was

775
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,760
was research that was really inspired by

776
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,520
the next two pieces you see

777
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,320
so if you imagine uh you know 1600

778
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,159
vulnerabilities are coming out next year

779
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,679
how would you know which ones we're

780
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,840
going to get exploits and with that i'll

781
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,799
hand over

782
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,640
to jay and sasha

783
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,120
thanks aaron uh next slide

784
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,559
so this is so epss exploit prediction

785
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,080
scoring systems this is an

786
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,200
effort um born out of a lot of work

787
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,640
uh by jay and and colleagues at kennedy

788
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,279
security

789
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,640
which is intended to fill a gap in the

790
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,880
industry so we have many problems as

791
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,480
practitioners and researchers in the

792
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,159
information security field

793
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,400
um one of which a big one is

794
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,240
prioritizing which vulnerabilities to

795
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,200
patch

796
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,120
uh there are existing standards and

797
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,200
efforts and strategies that everyone

798
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,279
knows about

799
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,640
based on you know current uh scoring

800
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,960
systems and certainly idiosyncratic

801
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,799
behaviors of the firm and whatever

802
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,360
but what we don't know what we haven't

803
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,400
been able to

804
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,640
create as a capability is an

805
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,480
understanding of

806
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,039
um which how the threat landscape is

807
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:25,600
changing

808
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,360
and which vulnerabilities actually are

809
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,440
being exploited in the wild

810
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,960
and that's what this effort is trying to

811
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,559
do it's a standards group now an

812
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,679
emerging standard

813
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,679
uh under first um and in addition to

814
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,840
predicting which vulnerabilities

815
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,279
will be exploited um on a score from

816
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,720
you know zero to one zero to a hundred

817
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,400
percent we would also

818
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,240
very much like the long-term goal of

819
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,240
this is to be able to understand that

820
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,919
threat landscape and hopefully be able

821
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,440
to explain

822
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,840
the threat landscape explain why certain

823
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,840
vulnerabilities are being exploited

824
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,200
relatively more than other

825
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,799
vulnerabilities so that's our that's our

826
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,159
long-term goal

827
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,640
but there's lots of work of course uh

828
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,880
that we need to do in order to get there

829
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,679
uh next slide the next bunch of slides i

830
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:12,960
think jay will take you to

831
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,200
through the uh the model sure

832
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,320
so um this is some research that

833
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,640
my company did with kenna where we're

834
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,159
looking at

835
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,720
remediation timelines and the amount of

836
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
remediation going on

837
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,520
and so each point on this plot is a an

838
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,960
organization

839
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,559
doing vulnerability scanning and

840
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,080
remediation over time

841
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,399
and this is over about a two-year period

842
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,159
and what's interesting is

843
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,480
that across the horizontal across the

844
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,240
x-axis we're seeing how many open

845
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,159
vulnerabilities are seen per month on

846
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,760
average across this two-year

847
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,919
window and then on the vertical we're

848
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,600
seeing how many did they close

849
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,000
per month and what's interesting is that

850
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,919
there's that red line is about 10

851
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,600
percent

852
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,039
um the redline is doing a best fit here

853
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,440
and so given all the vulnerabilities

854
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,279
that companies have across our network

855
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,640
and you can see in the upper right gets

856
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,159
over 10 million

857
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,720
um and those about 10 of those are being

858
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,159
remediated every month and so the

859
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:12,880
question is

860
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,240
which 10 you know and that's the huge

861
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,840
challenge i think that organizations

862
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,760
face how do they how do they decide what

863
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,480
to fix

864
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,640
and what needs to be delayed because

865
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,399
they're not getting 100 closure rate

866
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:25,520
every month they're not even close

867
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,080
they're about

868
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,159
you know five to 20 percent in there

869
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,600
next slide please and so

870
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,559
the the main thing that we want to grab

871
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,120
to

872
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,440
to try and solve this prioritization

873
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,880
challenge is data

874
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,039
trying to get at the data to understand

875
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,399
what's going on

876
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,000
what are the attributes of these

877
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,600
vulnerabilities

878
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,279
and how do they help us try to

879
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,200
understand which are being

880
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,440
attacked and which aren't and by the way

881
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,559
that's what we're focusing we're

882
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,600
focusing on exploitation activity

883
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,440
and if you're if you're trying to make a

884
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,039
full decision uh

885
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,840
typically based around risk or perhaps

886
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,799
time commitment

887
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,880
cost that sort of thing we're looking at

888
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,399
a small part of that

889
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,039
that sort of traditional risk equation

890
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,080
we're only looking at the

891
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,880
threat here and so as you're trying to

892
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,480
make a decision you want to take

893
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,399
the thing we're doing here to epss along

894
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,760
with a whole bunch of other

895
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,480
things in your environment the data the

896
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,279
asset all this stuff

897
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,559
but this is looking at our data

898
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,880
architecture so a lot of the things that

899
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,000
we're focusing on right now

900
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,360
sort of to the top of this where we're

901
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,919
looking at getting data to correlate and

902
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:34,399
enrich

903
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,919
bring all that data together and of

904
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,679
course the best way to do that is with a

905
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,120
cve id

906
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,440
so with all of these disparate vendors

907
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,200
and all these data sources

908
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
everybody hopefully is tracking the cva

909
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,880
id and we can start to bring in things

910
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,200
like

911
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,360
exploitation activity or exploit

912
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,760
creation publishing of exploit code

913
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,279
trying to bring that in and correlate it

914
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,120
and bring it all into essentially

915
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,520
talking about the same vulnerability

916
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,720
then from all of that data we're going

917
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,000
to do feature extraction we're going to

918
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,039
try and extract

919
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,960
what variables are going to be helpful

920
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,159
you know is that the the

921
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,120
cwe information the cp information how

922
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,799
do we bring out that information to

923
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,559
to make it accessible to a model and

924
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,240
hopefully make it meaningful

925
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,919
and then we're going to do some tweaking

926
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,600
of that and some tuning of the model and

927
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,600
model generation we went through this

928
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,760
for the first dpss we're in the process

929
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,840
of going through it for the next version

930
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,279
which hopefully is going to be a lot

931
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,520
better faster stronger all that good

932
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
stuff

933
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,520
um and those data sources are on the

934
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,120
right um sort of the

935
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,159
typical uh sort of sets of data sources

936
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:34,399
the

937
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,399
the interesting thing is on the exploit

938
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,399
activity side we're working with

939
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,880
fortinet and we're working with um

940
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,720
alienfall proofpoint several other

941
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,360
companies

942
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,679
especially through kenneth security to

943
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,200
try and understand

944
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,600
what is going on in that attacker sphere

945
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,559
what what are they

946
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,559
the threat capabilities what are they

947
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,320
going after what is the activity around

948
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,200
exploitation

949
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,600
in the wild which i think is is really

950
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,639
what's going to set this apart

951
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,000
next slide please and

952
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,760
when we did the first one we had a

953
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,039
couple of requirements that we're

954
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,960
dropping for the second one one of them

955
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,720
is that it had to be

956
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,120
very easy to implement when we were

957
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,880
designing the first one we thought

958
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,000
people are going to want to do this in

959
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,080
excel you know we had no

960
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,760
notion of a centralized system for epss

961
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,760
version 2 we're going to a centralized

962
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,279
system with api

963
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,679
so that nobody has to go out and gather

964
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:28,399
data or

965
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,399
rate things or fill in questions or

966
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:31,919
anything there's going to get a score

967
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,200
from a centralized

968
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,760
api and or just downloading all the

969
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,720
scores

970
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,159
so the first model though we tried to

971
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,760
limit it limit the number of variables

972
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,200
to things that were objective

973
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,120
easy to grab all this good stuff and we

974
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,200
came up with these 16 variables

975
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,960
and the model is on the left you can see

976
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,880
the the weights that were derived from

977
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,159
the data

978
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,159
and then sort of a visual representation

979
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,519
of those weights

980
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,840
with the dashed line and the vertical

981
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,919
they're talking about

982
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,760
things on the right are contributing to

983
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,440
the probability of exploitation things

984
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,039
on the left are going to detract from

985
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:03,760
that

986
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,360
and then the width of those

987
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,960
distributions are sort of talking about

988
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,519
the confidence around that score

989
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,039
and when we take a score we're just

990
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,960
grabbing the central point of those

991
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,960
curves and then we're putting in that

992
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,320
in that formula and getting out the

993
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,399
probability of exploitation within the

994
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,159
first 12 months and that's what we train

995
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,039
this to

996
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,640
and that's another thing we hope to to

997
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,480
shift with v2 about

998
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,440
what we're actually trying to predict

999
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,240
next slide please

1000
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,679
these are two curves um if you haven't

1001
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:34,880
seen these before

1002
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,320
um they're a little complex

1003
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,840
but if you've seen them before they're

1004
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,360
really helpful um

1005
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,200
if you as you've seen a lot of these

1006
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,880
they become a little bit more intuitive

1007
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,559
but the one on the left is a rock curve

1008
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,399
and we're trying to push the line

1009
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,919
into the upper left and one of the

1010
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,679
things that we wanted to make sure epss

1011
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,360
was doing is that it was better

1012
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,960
than what people are doing now and so we

1013
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,880
compared it to cvss

1014
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,159
and so that left when we're trying to

1015
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,320
push that line into the upper left

1016
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,159
if that line went straight up and

1017
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,840
straight over it would be a perfect

1018
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,720
model

1019
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,200
it is not and so we've got room to

1020
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,640
expand and get better

1021
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,440
but you can see the the cvss line if we

1022
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,799
and this is a continuous line because

1023
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,559
we're outputting between zero and one or

1024
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,200
is

1025
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,960
said zero and a hundred percent so if

1026
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,559
you start at 100 and go down you're

1027
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,080
going to start in that lower left corner

1028
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,440
and go to the upper right corner

1029
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,640
depending on where you are you're going

1030
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,399
to change your false positive rate so if

1031
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,360
you fix

1032
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,279
everything above 60 and above you're

1033
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,279
going to be you know with a low false

1034
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,039
positive rate and sort of a low

1035
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,799
true positive rate but as you go up

1036
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,000
you're going to increase your false

1037
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,799
positive rate

1038
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,880
and your true positive rate and same

1039
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,240
thing with with a

1040
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,200
cvss score as you lower your threshold

1041
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,720
for remediating you're going to go

1042
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,880
higher in the false positive rate and

1043
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,799
higher in the true positive rate

1044
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,240
and so you can see in the left one where

1045
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,000
we're exceeding what you

1046
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,399
what cvss is capable of predicting as

1047
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,240
far as exploitation activity

1048
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,919
the one on the right precision recall

1049
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,720
curve we re-label these in a lot of the

1050
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
papers we've done about efficiency and

1051
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,919
coverage it's

1052
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,919
the vertical is about how efficient the

1053
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,039
things that you remediate

1054
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,200
how efficient is that and when you start

1055
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,960
on a high score you're starting on the

1056
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,079
left side of that

1057
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,359
and this one we're trying to push to the

1058
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:12,560
upper right so you can see we've got a

1059
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,079
lot of room on this particular

1060
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,159
metric a set of metrics to go and

1061
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,599
improve

1062
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,960
but as you start on a high score you can

1063
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,040
have a very high efficiency and a low

1064
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,879
amount of coverage and coverages

1065
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,320
out of everything that you should be

1066
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,239
remediating what percent

1067
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,159
are you actually remediating with your

1068
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,079
decision approach here

1069
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,560
and so you can see cvss is quite low on

1070
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,520
this one

1071
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,399
not very efficient and that's something

1072
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,839
we talk about a lot of our research

1073
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,440
about comparing the efficiency and

1074
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,480
really what you're going to get from

1075
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,320
epss is that

1076
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,480
you probably will have to attack and go

1077
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,520
after less

1078
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,239
remediate less and be more efficient in

1079
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,239
your in your approach

1080
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,760
and so as we look at v2 we're going to

1081
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,440
be pushing the left one to the upper

1082
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,800
left and the right plot to the upper

1083
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,040
right

1084
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,040
next slide please to try

1085
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,680
and evaluate performance the the slide

1086
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,119
we just looked at was one way to look at

1087
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,560
the performance this is another way

1088
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,079
we're talking about the predictive

1089
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,839
probability and so the the plot on the

1090
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,839
left is a calibration plot

1091
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,640
um and essentially when people say hey

1092
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,079
you know you pretty

1093
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,040
you predicted this one to be a 20 and uh

1094
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,720
it was exploited so you were totally

1095
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,599
wrong

1096
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,359
and that is not at all what probability

1097
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,800
is all about it's when we say

1098
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,480
20 20 of everything we say is 20

1099
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,000
is probably going to be exploited and

1100
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,520
that's the way that probability works

1101
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,040
and so this plot is saying

1102
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,079
hey when we're talking you know 60

1103
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,400
we expect 60 of those to be exploited

1104
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,839
and so on and so forth so when you see

1105
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,359
something rated at

1106
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,520
1 and there are a lot of things rated

1107
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,280
less than one percent here because

1108
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,720
it's very heavy tailed um

1109
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,480
what we see is about one percent of

1110
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,160
those rated one percent are probably

1111
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,359
going to be exploited that this

1112
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,560
calibration curve is

1113
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,320
is pretty closely following what we

1114
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,480
would expect that dash line on the left

1115
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,720
the one on the right is just a quick

1116
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,640
sort of density plot looking at the

1117
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,520
distribution

1118
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,400
of vulnerabilities that are rated uh

1119
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,320
high or low and where they actually

1120
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,400
observe to be exploited or not exploited

1121
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,440
and you can see that

1122
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,160
red density is definitely more to the

1123
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:14,960
right

1124
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,760
the not exploited is definitely more to

1125
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,359
the left and there are some that overlap

1126
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,440
there are some that are rated very low

1127
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,119
that are exploited and there are some

1128
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,640
that are rated very high that are not

1129
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,000
exploited this is not a perfect

1130
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,680
model but we're trying to improve we're

1131
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,280
trying to do better than what is out

1132
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:29,680
there

1133
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,920
currently and that's really the key here

1134
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,200
we're just trying to make things better

1135
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,640
and hopefully with v2

1136
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,000
we're going to make it even better and

1137
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,280
and v3 again keep on improving

1138
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,400
and so a lot of that is going to be

1139
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,040
driven by the data we have available

1140
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,599
and all the work that we're putting into

1141
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,200
constructing these models and tuning

1142
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,560
them and making them perform it

1143
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,240
next slide please and i think here i'll

1144
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,560
turn it over to sasha to talk about

1145
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,000
the relationship between epss and cbss

1146
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,440
so this is the last slide that we have

1147
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,800
but let me take a couple of minutes

1148
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,720
before

1149
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,480
luca's great work so this is either a

1150
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,880
very powerful slide or a highly

1151
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,880
contentious one depending on your your

1152
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,920
views and biases

1153
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,359
um what this represents

1154
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,240
is is an illustration of as you

1155
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,520
mentioned the relationship between

1156
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,320
cbss and epss and if you believe that

1157
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,560
cvss is a measure of severity of

1158
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,520
vulnerability

1159
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,040
it's a composite of a bunch of different

1160
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,200
things but if um but in addition a

1161
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,280
measure of severity and eps is

1162
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,440
epss is a measure of probability of

1163
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,359
likelihood the vulnerability exploited

1164
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,599
what you have is this kind of familiar

1165
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,839
sort of risk curve now or this risk

1166
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,560
graph this risk matrix now it's not you

1167
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,119
know

1168
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,640
entirely exhaustive of all risk issues

1169
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,560
certainly but it does capture these two

1170
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,240
and what it enables you to do what these

1171
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,839
two standards will enable you to do is

1172
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:54,720
to plot

1173
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,160
each of the vulnerabilities and groups

1174
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,960
of vulnerabilities on a figure like this

1175
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,480
and what you see first of all is a lot

1176
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,880
of the mass centered on the bottom

1177
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,160
of the um of the figure suggesting

1178
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,118
uh that

1179
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,000
that it's not only true that it's not

1180
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,520
exclusively true that attackers are

1181
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:13,920
going

1182
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,560
after high severity vulnerabilities that

1183
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,760
they're exploiting high severity

1184
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,480
vulnerabilities

1185
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,960
moreover most vulnerabilities are not

1186
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,000
being exploited

1187
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,760
right i think this has come to be to be

1188
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,280
known to be true through different

1189
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,480
um research efforts five percent

1190
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,160
give or take of all vulnerabilities are

1191
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,680
being exploited

1192
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,520
so what you see on the bottom axis on

1193
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,359
the x-axis cbss score is from

1194
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,960
0 to 10 epss from 0 to 1 or 100

1195
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,440
so the stuff in the top right we would

1196
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,280
argue represents those vulnerabilities

1197
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,800
that could lead to a full compromise of

1198
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,440
a system

1199
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,160
being exploited from anywhere in in the

1200
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:50,800
internet

1201
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,560
and have a high probability of being

1202
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,880
exploited the stuff in the bottom left

1203
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,200
not so much and you can figure out there

1204
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,560
may be different strategies for an

1205
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,760
organization

1206
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,640
to interpret and respond remediate these

1207
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,119
different vulnerabilities

1208
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,800
but what i would what i would argue is

1209
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,960
that this this is a very powerful figure

1210
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,599
because

1211
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,480
it provides a very nice illustration of

1212
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,119
of

1213
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,240
potential strategies for for enterprises

1214
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,680
uh in addressing these different

1215
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,520
vulnerabilities

1216
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,839
um something that i would add has never

1217
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:22,960
been possible before

1218
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,160
because we didn't really have a good

1219
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,480
understanding of the exploitability

1220
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,119
of any of these vulnerabilities um so

1221
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,079
you could do this on

1222
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,359
a um on an organizational level

1223
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,960
you could do it on a wider enterprise

1224
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,960
level across

1225
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,040
across offices or even on a national

1226
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,040
level or international level right you

1227
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,480
filter out those vulnerabilities that

1228
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,800
you don't care about

1229
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,400
there's a lot more to digest here and

1230
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,119
happy to take questions on it

1231
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,040
but i'll stop there the la the final

1232
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,800
effort or the final point i'll make

1233
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,320
about epss again it's an

1234
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,320
open standard anyone is welcome to

1235
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,800
participate we have bi-weekly meetings

1236
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,520
and the data the actual exploit data are

1237
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,880
now available

1238
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,040
and posted for anyone to go download on

1239
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,319
the first site

1240
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:09,280
so i'll leave that and uh i just also

1241
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,000
want to add on

1242
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,839
if you notice uh in the lower right

1243
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,960
there's a url there at first.org

1244
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,880
this plot and several others are being

1245
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,160
generated

1246
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,520
i'll say mostly on a daily basis um

1247
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,839
and so like this this particular plot we

1248
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,440
have it's sort of picking out 10

1249
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,359
10 random cves and showing where they

1250
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,200
are on here and so it changes daily as

1251
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,400
you look at it

1252
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,960
but we've got other plots looking at you

1253
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,160
know recent

1254
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,920
cves that are published and the scores

1255
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,520
that they have and things that change

1256
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,079
over time

1257
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,480
because sometimes the cpe data gets

1258
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,160
updated a week after it's published or

1259
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,359
something like that and so

1260
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,280
the real time stats are there and as

1261
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,880
sasha mentioned that data are out there

1262
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,440
too

1263
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,200
that you can go and download on a daily

1264
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,119
basis and i should point out that

1265
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,359
we're in the um make it work stage and

1266
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,119
so we're we're in that first stage of

1267
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,560
trying to make things work so like if

1268
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,000
you go there right now i think

1269
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,880
last updated was sunday uh and so after

1270
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,400
we get up here i'm gonna go run it again

1271
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:02,720
for

1272
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,560
today but um we're still working on the

1273
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,000
back end process of all the data

1274
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,760
so there might be a delay sometimes in a

1275
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,520
day or two but

1276
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,520
most of the most should be current on a

1277
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,040
daily basis and so we're going to move

1278
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,280
into the next stage of making it

1279
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,960
making it work well in the next stage so

1280
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,839
thank you

1281
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,640
all right we'll take it over to lucca so

1282
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,760
you've got a sense of how many

1283
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,119
vulnerabilities might be coming next

1284
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,720
year you've got a sense of how likely

1285
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,240
are those vulnerabilities to have

1286
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,560
an exploit written for them and luca had

1287
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,319
done this great work and continues to do

1288
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:36,880
great work

1289
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,200
on how often will it be exploited so

1290
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,720
luca

1291
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,599
take it away yeah sure thank you and

1292
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:44,560
hello everybody

1293
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,440
so um this is this part of the work we

1294
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,119
call it the details of vulnerability

1295
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,359
exploitation in the sense that

1296
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,160
it reflects the fact that it is now

1297
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,839
empirically very well known

1298
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:59,839
that frequency of exploitation is not

1299
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,280
uniformly distributed among

1300
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,800
vulnerabilities

1301
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,359
and uh this part of the work that i'm

1302
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:06,079
gonna

1303
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,000
talk you through in the next uh sort of

1304
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,680
10 minutes

1305
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,680
is going to sort of try to dig up a

1306
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,720
little bit of the

1307
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,119
reasons why and what other factors apart

1308
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,160
from the pure

1309
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,319
as we've seen so far with vulnerability

1310
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,920
prediction models and with

1311
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,119
epss so apart from the vulnerability

1312
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,359
data that these models can use to tell

1313
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,520
you whether an exploit is likely or not

1314
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,480
what other factors are played for us it

1315
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,000
really all started

1316
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,720
some time ago uh now this is a picture

1317
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,160
from 2014

1318
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,000
uh for each of these slides that we left

1319
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,440
the paper where

1320
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,400
all the sort of mathematics and nitty

1321
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,079
gritty technical details

1322
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,960
of all the models and stuff are reported

1323
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,800
much more rigorously than what i want to

1324
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,200
bother you with uh today so i will try

1325
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,880
to give you the guest

1326
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,960
and this picture kind of does the job

1327
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,800
decently actually find myself to go back

1328
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,680
to this picture

1329
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,720
quite often it started all from a very

1330
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,480
simple question and that is

1331
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,280
what instruments do we as the defenders

1332
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,160
have

1333
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,000
to decide whether when a new

1334
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,920
vulnerability is out we should be

1335
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,480
worried

1336
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,920
or not or at least not quite yet yeah

1337
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,520
and so we thought well let's see what

1338
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,599
happens if we make like a venn diagram

1339
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,760
right of the universal vulnerabilities

1340
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,280
that is the old wounds

1341
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,960
square that you see there

1342
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,960
vulnerabilities with a proof of concert

1343
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,000
exploit in the top

1344
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,319
left of the of the diagram uh

1345
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:29,520
vulnerabilities

1346
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,560
that have uh recorded exploit in the

1347
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,520
wild so that

1348
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,000
somebody said well at least one exploit

1349
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,440
of this thing has been

1350
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,280
detected at scale uh on the internet

1351
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,079
and the exploits that are traded in

1352
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,680
underground markets and here in

1353
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,160
particular in some of the more prominent

1354
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,400
underground markets operating in the in

1355
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,760
the russian space

1356
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,599
and well if one looks at this and here

1357
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,079
of course areas are proportional to

1358
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,680
number of vulnerabilities so

1359
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,800
two two uh insights come up

1360
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,200
uh and they're very very much in line of

1361
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,160
course with what

1362
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,000
uh sasha was just saying before with the

1363
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
last picture but also with the rest of

1364
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,920
the sense of this panel

1365
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,359
and that is that the answer to the first

1366
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,560
question that is

1367
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,640
is there a new vulnerability should i

1368
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,680
worry well the answer is most likely not

1369
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,240
and the second question one may ask is

1370
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,319
well yeah but it has a very high cost

1371
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,319
score sure should i be worried now and

1372
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:27,599
the answer is here well

1373
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,800
not really not necessary right and this

1374
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,400
now is part of the

1375
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,680
of the common understanding of

1376
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,920
what are the limits of vulnerability

1377
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,920
matrix we currently have

1378
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,680
and indeed css has never made the

1379
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,800
promise of being a risk matric

1380
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,880
not since when at least this discourse

1381
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,960
is developed enough

1382
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,119
yet of course it's still the state the

1383
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,800
standard the factor but here if you look

1384
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,520
at it

1385
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,440
there is simply and then again the more

1386
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,920
rigorous analysis is in the paper but if

1387
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,440
you were to just patch all the red

1388
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,960
vulnerabilities here

1389
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,720
you're going to end up do a whole lot of

1390
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,160
work that you shouldn't be doing

1391
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,000
patching vulnerabilities that don't have

1392
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,480
an exploit and you will also miss a

1393
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,480
whole lot of vulnerabilities that do

1394
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,440
have an exploit right so uh that

1395
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,319
wouldn't work

1396
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,119
they wouldn't work wonders for you um

1397
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,960
but then again this is very preliminary

1398
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,240
and is only looking at

1399
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,880
presence of exploit or no presence of

1400
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,000
exploit in terms of

1401
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,800
evidence yeah it doesn't really tell you

1402
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,160
how much

1403
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,319
how frequently a certain exploit would

1404
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,200
be used

1405
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,839
or uh whether that distribution is

1406
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,400
somewhat uniform across exploits

1407
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,440
uh so next slide please

1408
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,440
uh and so this is where the the sort of

1409
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,520
the heavy tales of exploitation come

1410
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,839
into place because if you zoom in into

1411
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,920
only the exploited vulnerabilities so

1412
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,800
this is not

1413
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,079
all cds these are cvs for which an

1414
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,720
exploit has been reported in the wild

1415
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,119
and you look at the distribution of the

1416
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,680
frequency of attacks against

1417
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,079
these different cvs and here i present a

1418
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:02,960
view

1419
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,000
split over different software types and

1420
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,200
you see that there is a

1421
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,720
i mean a hugely skewed distribution

1422
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,680
there

1423
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,720
whereas whereby a very very

1424
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,839
small fraction of vulnerabilities carry

1425
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,240
a disproportionate amount of risk with

1426
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,440
respect to all the others

1427
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,560
vulnerabilities

1428
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,240
even though those other vulnerabilities

1429
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,720
do have an exploit

1430
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,040
so the numbers are staggering right i

1431
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,839
mean if you if you look in

1432
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,400
the worst case you could have up to five

1433
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,319
percent of the vulnerabilities

1434
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,200
for which an exploit in the wild exists

1435
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,079
carrying up to

1436
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,359
95 of the attacks and this is roughly

1437
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:44,800
true for windows for pro

1438
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,280
productivity uh software that is office

1439
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,800
platforms and so on

1440
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,200
browser software it speaks for itself

1441
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,200
for plug-in is a slightly different

1442
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,640
story but once you actually

1443
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,560
dig into the data you see that if you

1444
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,240
differentiate

1445
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,880
all the the reason why the curve is

1446
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,319
moved more toward

1447
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:06,560
the the equality line there

1448
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,440
is really because that trend is driven

1449
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,000
by

1450
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,839
uh java and

1451
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,599
the whole difference stays in the

1452
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,280
pre-oracle and the

1453
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,319
post oracle let's say

1454
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,960
division of java so when java was still

1455
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,160
sound microsystem

1456
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,200
up until 2009 this rule was not true

1457
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,640
once uh there is the switch over to to

1458
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,200
to oracle java this becomes true well

1459
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,960
the reason probably lays in the fact

1460
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:35,839
that people

1461
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,559
that were deploying the sun as the the

1462
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,440
sun's version of java were

1463
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,960
delaying uh moving over to to the oracle

1464
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,599
version

1465
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,440
and this created this effect whereby

1466
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,680
certain vulnerabilities remained around

1467
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,200
for much longer and

1468
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,680
created this effect but the bottom line

1469
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,960
of this is that

1470
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,720
clearly there is a strong strong skew

1471
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,480
with respect to what attackers are

1472
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,599
actually doing

1473
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,240
with vulnerabilities that simply looking

1474
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,599
at cves and that was

1475
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,079
as we saw before also by simply looking

1476
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,720
at success course is not gonna tell you

1477
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,480
um and what is also a bit impressive

1478
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,400
perhaps from these is that so this comes

1479
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,640
from data that comes from millions of

1480
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,359
hosts

1481
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:23,119
worldwide right and it spans uh

1482
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,319
several years of observation so what you

1483
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:27,680
would expect there

1484
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,160
is that uh there is some kind of

1485
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,400
oscillation maybe some vulnerabilities

1486
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,160
go up and then they're replaced by

1487
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,200
another one

1488
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,760
even if they carry the vast majority of

1489
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,880
of attacks

1490
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,800
you wouldn't expect such a small

1491
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,079
fraction to remain

1492
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,160
responsible for the vast majority of

1493
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,880
attacks for such a long period of time

1494
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,119
this tells us something right because if

1495
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,520
attackers were actually reacting so

1496
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,359
quickly at the introduction of a new

1497
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,280
vulnerability and immediately exploit

1498
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,559
them at scale

1499
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,359
then this plot here these data would

1500
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:00,640
make no sense

1501
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,040
so obviously that explanation doesn't

1502
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,960
doesn't match reality and we need to

1503
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,559
find a better one

1504
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,240
so next slide please and so this is what

1505
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,920
for follow-up work uh

1506
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,839
try to do in that direction it's really

1507
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,400
trying to ask uh

1508
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,440
how often does the threat scenario

1509
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,680
change when you look at vulnerability

1510
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,040
exploitation

1511
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,839
and again the paper is is in is in the

1512
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,280
footnote there and

1513
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,480
you will find lots of um

1514
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,680
very detailed uh models that explain the

1515
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,319
data

1516
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:37,359
uh both from uh from a more foundational

1517
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:41,200
but also more empirical way

1518
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,480
and but this graph again sort of sums up

1519
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,880
the intuition behind it and what you see

1520
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,079
here is

1521
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,119
how much time on the x-axis

1522
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,480
it has to pass for a new attack

1523
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,680
against a certain type of software is

1524
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,800
more likely to arrive again on one of

1525
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,559
your systems

1526
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,319
than an attacker that you have already

1527
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:05,599
seen in the past

1528
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,240
so essentially it tells you for how long

1529
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,839
the attackers are going to keep

1530
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,720
using and using and using again same

1531
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,920
vulnerability

1532
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,760
attacking the same kind of software

1533
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,839
before they have to switch over to a new

1534
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:20,160
vulnerability

1535
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,319
that that will replace the previous one

1536
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,480
and if you look at the timeline there

1537
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,640
we're talking of almost three years

1538
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,440
so it takes three years for attackers to

1539
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,520
change their attack portfolio

1540
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,119
to a degree enough for a switch in the

1541
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,240
likelihood of you

1542
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,480
getting a new exploit as opposed to an

1543
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,440
older one

1544
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,960
against the software platform that you

1545
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,960
still have deployed

1546
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,520
and the time that passes in there is

1547
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,160
almost

1548
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,599
800 days so this clearly is completely

1549
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:52,880
incompatible with

1550
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,440
with the idea that every new cte that is

1551
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,079
out there must be patched immediately

1552
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,599
because at least when you look at attack

1553
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,319
at mass obviously attackers are not

1554
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:03,520
behaving like that

1555
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,760
and having a defensive model that is

1556
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,240
completely disassociated from that

1557
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,200
uh simply makes no sense if nothing else

1558
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,720
because that model

1559
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,760
generates data that is as extreme as the

1560
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,680
one that we've been showing you today

1561
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,920
and throughout the whole presentation

1562
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,559
really including uh the word from sasha

1563
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:23,520
jay

1564
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,800
and matilda and erin

1565
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,800
so the question is what is it that we

1566
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,200
can do to try to figure out what is it

1567
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,880
that these attackers are trying to do at

1568
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,200
least when we look at the tax at mass

1569
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,920
this is where the next slide uh comes in

1570
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,599
handy

1571
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,960
uh and so what we've been doing and is

1572
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,040
really trying to figure out and to sort

1573
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,200
of reverse engineer a little bit the

1574
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,319
the attack economics that are behind

1575
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:52,800
exploit innovation and threat innovation

1576
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,880
by attackers themselves

1577
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,000
and see whether these intuitions on top

1578
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
of the vulnerability data that we

1579
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,559
already

1580
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,960
are aware of including civilization

1581
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,000
severity scores

1582
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,119
and whatnot can add more information to

1583
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,680
how we actually go about predicting

1584
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,400
uh whether uh whether a vulnerability

1585
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,160
will be exploited and

1586
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,640
possibly also to what extent and so

1587
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,079
we've been doing this by

1588
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:20,240
looking and this is something that we

1589
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,599
here at ue are now

1590
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,640
me and my group are are have delved

1591
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,760
into quite a bit and and uh in the

1592
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,720
direction particularly of finding out

1593
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,880
what are the reference communities and

1594
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,800
what are the what is the kind of threat

1595
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,880
intelligence that you want to look at

1596
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,119
or at least the sources of the threat

1597
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,040
intelligence you want to look at

1598
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,640
to have credible information about

1599
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,960
whether a vulnerability carries

1600
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,480
significant risk

1601
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,960
or represents that noise that we have

1602
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,920
characterized

1603
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,839
for the for for the past 40 minutes now

1604
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,160
and here are two examples of these data

1605
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,079
sources one on the left-hand side one

1606
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,160
very common very famous underground

1607
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,599
market where

1608
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:07,119
they they sell everything from uh

1609
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,240
from from from drugs to vulnerability

1610
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,240
exploits and malware

1611
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,640
but there you find some kind of uh

1612
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,480
threat uh that is not really

1613
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,440
technologically

1614
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,040
interesting in the sense that it doesn't

1615
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,640
really tell you much

1616
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,400
about the actual innovation that

1617
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,079
attackers put in place

1618
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,680
so to give you an example there you

1619
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,599
would be buying for six dollars on the

1620
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:28,480
left-hand side

1621
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,119
uh on the left-hand hand side of this

1622
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:32,000
slide

1623
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,160
for six dollars you would be buying a

1624
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,440
pdf manual

1625
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,079
of how to deploy this use botnet that is

1626
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:39,119
also you know

1627
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,960
and the bots and this use malware is

1628
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,200
available on github for you to download

1629
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,000
freely on the right hand side is a more

1630
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
prominent russian underground market

1631
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:48,960
where they actually

1632
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,319
sell some of the

1633
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,760
some of the more prominent attacks that

1634
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,960
we've been

1635
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,280
that we've been looking at and once you

1636
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,200
start diving into that data

1637
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,880
next slide uh please uh once you start

1638
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,119
diving into that data

1639
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,040
um yes um and you look at the numbers

1640
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,559
again all the the paper evolves

1641
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,960
in depth into into the into the

1642
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,319
different statistics

1643
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:23,040
and here i only present you the uh the

1644
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,880
threat innovation the ones that are

1645
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,720
relevant to threat innovation

1646
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,480
and if you look on the left-hand side

1647
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,280
that give you a count of how many new

1648
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,040
vulnerability exploits

1649
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,319
come up into these markets per year and

1650
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:37,760
you see that the pace at which they

1651
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,200
arrive is not

1652
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,240
very very high uh

1653
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,359
but on the right hand side i provide you

1654
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,000
with the with some breakdown by software

1655
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,359
vendor

1656
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:53,119
of the time that passes in between

1657
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,480
the market starts demanding a new uh

1658
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,319
vulnerability exploit that will

1659
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,480
substitute the ones that is already

1660
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,440
being traded

1661
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,839
into that market or the ones that are

1662
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:05,920
already being traded into that market

1663
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,680
and if you just look at the

1664
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,640
at this at the scale of the x-axis

1665
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,359
access of the right-hand side plot

1666
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:17,280
and next slide please

1667
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,280
and you look at that and you compare it

1668
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,799
no no the previous one the one with the

1669
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:21,440
animation

1670
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,119
sorry but uh yeah that was the trick um

1671
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,160
the uh if you look at the uh

1672
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,240
simply the time scale there you see that

1673
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,920
there is a staggering match

1674
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,640
between what attacker economics can tell

1675
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,599
us about threat

1676
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,680
innovation and what you can actually go

1677
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,880
about measuring

1678
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,079
in the wild so now next slide and with

1679
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,160
these i will conclude

1680
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,079
so the idea is really that we can factor

1681
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,640
these things together i think that

1682
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,400
with what we've been presenting so far

1683
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,400
you may be convinced that vulnerability

1684
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,480
data is already extremely important to

1685
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,200
make

1686
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,119
to move toward more quantitative

1687
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:00,559
assessments of risk

1688
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,319
but once we are actually able of

1689
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,799
figuring out more about the attacker

1690
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:05,520
behavior

1691
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,359
particularly in relation to a toxic

1692
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:08,880
scale then

1693
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,960
we can actually build quantitative

1694
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,119
measurements

1695
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:15,040
of vulnerability exploitation

1696
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,359
on the left-hand side there you see

1697
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:19,440
relations uh and that if you

1698
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,559
if you click the button area an image

1699
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:23,680
will appear

1700
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,400
uh that is perhaps more meaningful than

1701
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,359
just the

1702
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:30,640
the table per se but what this simply

1703
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,400
tells you is that there is a very clear

1704
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,680
relationship between

1705
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,359
attacker economics and behavior of

1706
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:40,250
mass attackers with respect to

1707
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,839
[Music]

1708
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,160
our ability to predict whether a

1709
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,319
vulnerability is going to be exploited

1710
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,760
in the wild

1711
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,559
and if we start plugging this into an

1712
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:51,200
actual

1713
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,359
quantitative framework and this is the

1714
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:55,119
the plot on the right hand side that

1715
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:56,160
comes from

1716
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,680
another study and we start looking

1717
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,720
at insights from these considerations

1718
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,640
and plugging them into our risk

1719
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,680
functions

1720
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,000
then we can actually derive quantitative

1721
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,440
risk assessment

1722
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,319
methods that are moving finally away

1723
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:12,799
from

1724
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:15,359
simply having experts that tell you yeah

1725
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:17,040
i think this vulnerability is going to

1726
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,640
be very bad you should patch it

1727
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,599
immediately

1728
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:23,680
to actually evidence-based risk matrix

1729
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,920
that can tell you on a vulnerability by

1730
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,440
vulnerability basis

1731
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,240
and as a function of time uh end of your

1732
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:30,799
system

1733
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:34,400
uh what the actual risk realistically

1734
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,760
uh could be again in the framework of

1735
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,960
mass attackers or or

1736
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,280
attacks against against the mass of

1737
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,040
internet users

1738
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,880
with this i will wrap up i don't know

1739
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,720
how we did with time but

1740
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,880
um i think erie and we're happy that

1741
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,559
we had that extras an hour absolutely

1742
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:59,119
yes and thank you again all of you for

1743
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:00,880
joining me in this presentation to the

1744
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:01,839
audience

1745
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:04,400
um if you're anything like me your head

1746
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,680
is probably swimming with this

1747
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,839
i hope that the number one takeaway from

1748
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:10,400
all this great research is that

1749
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,040
the attackers can be predicted to some

1750
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:13,599
degree

1751
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,280
and so there is hope you know there's

1752
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,440
this overwhelming story in our industry

1753
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,920
the defenders just have to react and

1754
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,760
they can't predict the camp forecast

1755
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,880
they're always on the run and they're

1756
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,680
exhausted

1757
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,839
but i think we've just shown you three

1758
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:27,680
excellent stories of hope

1759
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,680
about how in the future you might be

1760
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,520
able to do less work

1761
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,640
and better defense all at the same time

1762
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:35,359
so

1763
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:37,520
with that we will be taking questions

1764
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,000
inside the work adventure app

1765
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,160
i hope you'll join us in two-bit space

1766
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,200
to

1767
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,480
give us questions and thank you very

1768
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,160
much for listening to this presentation

1769
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,680
i know that you're all busy people

1770
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,200
so i really appreciate you taking the

1771
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,119
time to listen to these fantastic

1772
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:54,160
researchers

1773
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:58,240
so um yeah see you in the questions

1774
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,000
thank you very much aaron and thank you

1775
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,440
so much all of you for

1776
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,599
in the three very inspirational stories

1777
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:06,720
on how we can do security better

1778
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,440
everyone the q a will happen in a work

1779
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,160
adventure

1780
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,000
you just walk up to the second floor

1781
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,920
there's a room to there and you can ask

1782
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:14,640
questions

1783
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,480
to these esteemed panelists there and

1784
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,079
also join us afterwards

1785
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:20,880
for the open social hour also in work

1786
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:21,760
adventure

1787
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,440
thank you very much everyone and thank

1788
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,480
you to the presenters

1789
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:31,839
thank you
