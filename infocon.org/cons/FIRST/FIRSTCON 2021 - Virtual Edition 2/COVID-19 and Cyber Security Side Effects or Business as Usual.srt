1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,080
well hello everybody and welcome to

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,560
covet 19 and cyber security side effects

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,000
or business as usual

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,680
at firstcom21

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,679
and hello from me as well and um

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:14,320
actually

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,720
record we always show some kind of

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,080
movie or something like that in the

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,119
beginning isn't it what have we

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,359
at this moment at this moment we have

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,439
something really relevant and funny

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,960
but there's always a learning moment

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,840
let's watch the video

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,880
so this girl's coming in with her mask

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,079
on you all need to see this

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,959
look at this ghetto

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,960
hello how you

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
where'd you get that mask from well

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,320
since we have to wear them and it makes

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,039
it harder to breathe

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,039
this makes it a lot easier to breathe

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,320
cutting it yeah

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,399
i'll do that too thanks for the advice

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,800
appreciate you

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,800
yeah so as you can see it's a really

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,399
funny video

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,800
funny but covet 19 related as well and

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,640
also cyber security related

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
how many of you did notice at the four

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,960
seconds that the pin code of the pos was

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,839
actually visible

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,960
hello my name is richard zuniber i'm a

is already 33 years that's a long time

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,320
and since that time well i did so many

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,280
things i could have

38
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,840
written a book about it i have not done

39
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,560
that

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,240
but i'm happy to be here yes

41
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,280
and hello i'm eddie williams i'm

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,880
security evangelist of g

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,200
data i'm a board member of so many

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,680
organizations too much to name actually

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,040
and i'm also a long time in the industry

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,479
and actually i did write the book about

47
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:50,720
it

48
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,360
and that's cyber danger you can see it

49
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,840
over here

50
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,360
and it always start with memories

51
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,079
isn't it at least that's what we always

52
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,799
do

53
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,040
and let's have a look at the beginning

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,560
of 2020 when

55
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,440
of course we started that year with

56
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,318
ransomware

57
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,800
and ransomware well we saw a lot of

58
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,640
attacks all over the place ranging from

59
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,080
the u.s

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,280
to the eu to asia

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,160
and to a lot of countries actually but

62
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,879
then

63
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,000
it all changed isn't it in march 2020

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,520
when the pandemic started of course

65
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,319
ransomware didn't stop that's also what

66
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,280
we will see

67
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,080
a little bit later on but let's now

68
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,519
concentrate on

69
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,560
a couple of other things

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,239
with a massive certain move to home

71
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,239
offices it was basically opening

72
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,280
pandora's box

73
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,000
it was almost like an unbox boxing video

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,080
not knowing what you were unboxing

75
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,840
besides technical i.t problems that

76
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,920
people discovered being at home

77
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,080
people also started to hoard especially

78
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,120
toilet paper

79
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,680
you may have all seen the results in the

80
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,120
grocery markets

81
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,920
as we do all need toilet paper but like

82
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,680
with it problems you fall back to

83
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,440
certain solutions

84
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,519
and that also showed that people working

85
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,560
from home

86
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,400
it really showed how people didn't

87
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,680
understand info security

88
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,319
one of these things was we had to go

89
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:18,720
into

90
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,920
zoom meetings and everybody is now

91
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,760
talking about zoomy things like it's the

92
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,640
normal thing

93
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,480
enormous thing in the world but there

94
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,000
was a lot of problems in the beginning

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,440
when people had to move over

96
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,280
eddie can you develop something like saw

97
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,959
some information about the zoom meetings

98
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,640
oh yes zoom meetings yeah before

99
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,879
you know it was just a small tiny thing

100
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,200
we sometimes used or maybe not

101
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,920
at all but of course now everybody seems

102
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,720
to use it

103
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,879
and of course it all started with uh

104
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,480
well

105
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,439
let us say the zoom meeting from boris

106
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,080
johnson

107
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,760
where boris johnson of course um

108
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,000
well took its screenshot and put it that

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,760
somewhere on the internet

110
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,799
and you need to know in the beginning

111
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,120
zoom was not really protected quite well

112
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,840
actually

113
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,480
by doing that there was of course a

114
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,360
possibility

115
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,399
that well somebody else used that

116
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,000
zoom id to get inside the meeting

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,120
because there was actually not really

118
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,840
a password required and that's of course

119
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,280
one of the problems we saw in the

120
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,320
beginning

121
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,440
zoom was completely not prepared and

122
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,080
that of course is always giving a lot of

123
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,759
security problems

124
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,919
and that's also what we saw and that's

125
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,080
not only the only thing we saw because

126
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,720
of course

127
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,759
zoom became very popular and we saw also

128
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,000
an

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,520
enormous amount of domains zoom domains

130
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,240
registered in early 2020. if you look at

131
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,560
these

132
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,320
statistics for instance you can easily

133
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,600
see that

134
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,040
and that was not only the the

135
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,680
the the thing we saw as well because we

136
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,360
also spotted something completely

137
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,080
different

138
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,120
even the zoom and the webex themed

139
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,240
hardware

140
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,840
seems to become also quite interesting

141
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,240
and

142
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,840
seems to be also becoming very popular

143
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,880
those days look at this

144
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,720
graphic where you can easily see that

145
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,840
when the pandemic started well

146
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,919
this theme also started unfortunately

147
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,479
of course that brings us to of course

148
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,240
some good

149
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,520
useful tips for people using personal

150
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,400
i.t

151
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,479
to work from home and that's something

152
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,080
in the national cyber security

153
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,600
center uh well um

154
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,440
released at some point which is a good

155
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,360
thing isn't it richard

156
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,400
absolutely the the report is

157
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,560
really well written really great advice

158
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,440
but people are

159
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,080
not really following it and that's also

160
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,840
because of something else

161
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,280
uh people are like being tricked a lot

162
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,680
and

163
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,360
we know about fishing and social

164
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,280
engineering but now we have something

165
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,240
similar

166
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,319
with video conferences with actually

167
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,360
water holding

168
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,600
where people are getting invites for

169
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,639
like they think

170
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,639
is a zoom meeting with a company or

171
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,919
somebody they know

172
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,840
but in reality it actually is a zoo

173
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,880
meeting

174
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,039
where they are going to connect to some

175
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,440
criminal or somebody trying to steal

176
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,639
like information from them uh and before

177
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,960
you know it

178
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,039
everything because everything is spoofed

179
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,319
you don't know what's going to happen

180
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,400
what happens when you do connect will

181
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,840
you or your employee

182
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,400
give information freely because it seems

183
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
the invite is coming from like a known

184
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,039
company

185
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,759
but it is actually like a criminal doing

186
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,479
that

187
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,000
and even worse sometimes it happens that

188
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,479
people

189
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,800
post selfies where they are in an online

190
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,160
meeting and this happened with a

191
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,919
confidential conference call between the

192
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,240
ministers of defense of the ec

193
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,919
one of them had to work from home due to

194
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,440
covert 90's symptoms

195
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,080
proper social discipline but due to the

196
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,880
post

197
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
of a dutch tech journalist he could

198
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,599
easily connect to the call

199
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,039
but richard isn't that not covering much

200
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,840
of well a lot of issues actually we

201
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,639
presented

202
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,039
earlier absolutely we have written

203
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,840
actually in 2010 we both together wrote

204
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,520
a paper about this

205
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,039
and i'm pretty sure we should do an

206
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,639
update on this because

207
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,240
everything that we actually predicted

208
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,000
materialized and still happens

209
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,759
but that's not the topic for today eddie

210
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,360
so let's do that another time

211
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,960
it just shows you right now that

212
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,560
professionals working with social

213
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,520
distancing

214
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,199
advising people don't understand infosec

215
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,039
and another thing that i really dislike

216
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,360
the answers that people sometimes give

217
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,720
like the advice

218
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,479
so something we always have been working

219
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,840
against is

220
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,879
what like the advice to the people

221
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,599
online

222
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,919
the education the awareness and here we

223
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:58,960
have like

224
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
a frequently asked questions from the

225
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,879
aids prevention in the netherlands

226
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,759
like telling kids how to do safe sex is

227
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,639
by sexting or phone sex

228
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,199
sexting with group using skype super

229
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,039
microsoft themes or using webcam sets

230
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:13,680
because

231
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,240
that keeps you safe from cove at 19. it

232
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,840
is exactly what you and i have been

233
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,800
telling for years

234
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,240
to be careful what you do on the

235
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,599
internet and now professional

236
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,479
organizations

237
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,199
are actually advising against it and

238
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,879
that is really worrying

239
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,479
and some good things of course of the

240
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,160
internet is that information is freely

241
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,320
available it's easy to search for

242
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,799
information and to spike on information

243
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,080
on the corona virus

244
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,839
was expected except this is a graphical

245
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,719
representation the statistic

246
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,279
and it's coming from a weird place why

247
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,120
would you look for information on the

248
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,560
corona virus

249
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,720
here at pornhub really it is beyond me

250
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
in general visiting lots of those

251
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,640
pornographic sites may lead to

252
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,800
being bombarded with network but also

253
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,160
malware

254
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,959
and we have we have seen a lot of covet

255
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,360
19 related malware it was the perfect

256
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,440
social engineering angle trying to have

257
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,399
people open

258
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,959
or starting malicious content numerous

259
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,200
campaigns about abusing covet 19 were

260
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,680
seen

261
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,560
and many of them resulted in well

262
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,240
actually what eddie already mentioned

263
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
many of them resulted in

264
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,200
ransomware being launched on your system

265
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,080
and it was clear

266
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,839
that the human factor is an important

267
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,600
aspect that should not be under or

268
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,720
overestimated

269
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,320
within the realm of cyber crime eddie

270
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,279
do you have like some information about

271
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,959
the human factor

272
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,440
well how do we get infected or hacked

273
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,320
well i i actually created a formula

274
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,519
about that

275
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,000
and i described in this formula which

276
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,279
you can see over here

277
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,839
a cyber security problem and a cyber

278
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,360
security problem seems to be

279
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,480
always related to the human factor

280
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,160
you know our curiosity our naivety

281
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,399
you know we want to we always clicking

282
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,079
on the wrong link

283
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,120
typical human behavior and it's always

284
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,880
related as well to the technological

285
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
factor which is of course the malware

286
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,320
you know the malicious links the

287
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,519
exploits uh the vulnerability itself

288
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,959
and it's always in a relation to each

289
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,040
other and that's actually what i call

290
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,920
a cyber security problem i've given a

291
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,320
ticks talk about it actually as well

292
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,600
and that should be out around this time

293
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,079
i i also wrote a book about it which is

294
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,560
actually called cyber danger so

295
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,240
that's also the book i mentioned in the

296
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,600
beginning so

297
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,519
you always can have a look at it if you

298
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,200
want but

299
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,760
it is really a big big problem and the

300
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,880
problem is of course

301
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,600
also with scams but what are scams well

302
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,920
there are so many scams and of course we

303
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,959
see

304
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,279
so many scams and we saw also a lot of

305
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,079
scams during the cohit 19 periods

306
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,640
actually this one is a call for paper

307
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,399
for the cairo 2020

308
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,839
workshop and look at this you know

309
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,160
of course it seems to be that it's i'm

310
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,920
contacting you because i'm doing some

311
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,720
research

312
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,320
etc etc but of course it's a scam

313
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,680
in the end so even workshops can be

314
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,040
targeted so please be careful for this

315
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,880
and of course it's not always related to

316
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,160
this

317
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,040
look at this one actually people are

318
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,680
selling

319
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,959
oxygen well who is

320
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,640
selling oxygen i i would

321
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,920
buy it but you know well it seems to be

322
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,399
to became a trend during the kobet 19

323
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,680
period

324
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,880
uh but yeah anyway um

325
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,200
let's talk about uh hacking or should we

326
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,440
call it maybe manual while we're or is

327
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,880
it maybe only fishing

328
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,519
actually well of course hacking is

329
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,440
always depending on of course a lot of

330
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,320
things

331
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,200
and mostly it's depending on well

332
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
vulnerabilities on the servers on

333
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,959
software on the servers which are not

334
00:11:58,959 --> 00:11:59,760
patched

335
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,240
and that's one of the biggest problems

336
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,120
of course there are

337
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,600
a lot of other problems we saw uh like

338
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,200
for instance this one

339
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,079
this is a specific attack to the world

340
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,360
health organization

341
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,839
website or at least the users of it so

342
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,279
it was actually an attack it was

343
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,200
mimicking actually the email system of

344
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,800
the world health organization that was

345
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,480
using spear phishing against the

346
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,480
employees

347
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,399
possibly it came from the dark hazel

348
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,600
hotel apt

349
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,639
group from south korea of course um you

350
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,680
know this is just

351
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,240
one example but that we got loads of

352
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,399
examples actually also from credential

353
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,200
theft

354
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,600
where kovitz 19 is used of course we

355
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,040
we saw this actually in a lot of

356
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,200
languages not only english

357
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,440
so every language got their own problems

358
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,959
related to it

359
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,839
um and of course this is also a typical

360
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,040
credential theft

361
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,240
going to the an outlook account

362
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,000
but we also got phishing attacks

363
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,440
specifically dedicated

364
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,800
of course to the kovit 19 period as well

365
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,000
this is a very nice example as well

366
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,040
so um but

367
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,360
ricotta i think you also got a couple of

368
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,160
good

369
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,440
examples isn't it oh yeah as you showed

370
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,639
the scams are

371
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,800
always after your data or your money or

372
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,040
something else that you supposedly have

373
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,880
or they try to work on your emotions

374
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,720
like in this specific case

375
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,639
using covert 19 and the production

376
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,639
difficulties of the vaccine

377
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,279
to get money out of you no new technique

378
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,839
is just in your carrier

379
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,760
other carriers that kept being misused

380
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,920
as well there's a lot of additional

381
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,440
payroll fraud as well

382
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,199
normally when you change bank you go to

383
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,040
the financial department

384
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,120
of your company now we are working all

385
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,040
from home and changing it

386
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,680
via email or telephone call companies

387
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,079
really

388
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,360
look uh into this and really should pay

389
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,079
attention

390
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,720
as how often they change bank accounts

391
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,639
how often do people that

392
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,199
and that that is then in normal times

393
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,720
during covert 19 it will even be less

394
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,279
so we see like a lot of different things

395
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,720
with administration

396
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,920
sign-in site serving covert 19 also the

397
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,600
invoice fraud is increasing

398
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,000
the criminals have adopted here as well

399
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,519
making use of home offices and they

400
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,000
minimize

401
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,279
possibilities for people to verify

402
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,160
normally you would ask the cfo in person

403
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,639
but

404
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,199
he is now also at home most likely busy

405
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,880
with one of those back to back online

406
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,920
meetings they have all day

407
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,600
and eventually any of these

408
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,160
tricks could actually lead to ransomware

409
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,800
and ransomware attacks

410
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,639
eddie tell us ah

411
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,639
ransomware attacks well i think it's

412
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,680
more or less the story of my life

413
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,240
google it anyway ransomware attacks of

414
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,839
course we saw a lot of

415
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,880
uh ransomware attacks and we saw even

416
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,079
ransomware attacks

417
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,839
dedicated to covet 19.

418
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,639
concerning the coronavirus these are a

419
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,639
couple of examples of it

420
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,440
um and of course it's it's very terrible

421
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:09,920
if

422
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,920
if you look at those kind of things like

423
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,079
this kind of attack it's a ransomware

424
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:14,880
attack on

425
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,079
a school and they actually paid

426
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,519
the rent somewhere after the attack

427
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,880
but actually i don't

428
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,800
like it you know because it's actually

429
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,560
stimulating the whole

430
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,759
well a ransomware industry

431
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,160
what do you think about it richard you

432
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,759
have a really good point here

433
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,759
and basically it boils down

434
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,040
to pay or not to pay for instance the

435
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,720
university of maastricht which you use

436
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,800
as an example earlier on

437
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,040
they paid as well when the student

438
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,959
systems were all hijacked

439
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,000
and a ransom was being asked

440
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,959
and yes i agree with you the default

441
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:57,519
should be

442
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,560
not to pay but sometimes and that this

443
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,320
really made me wonder eddie

444
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,079
that's one of the debates we quite often

445
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,519
have uh

446
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,240
isn't it context and content related

447
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,160
what if the university of maastricht

448
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,320
at that time there was no vaccine yet

449
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,000
had the solution had the vaccine

450
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
enhanced the formula to the vaccine

451
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,800
and then the ransomware hit is 200 000

452
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,000
euro or dollar too much to save a

453
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,839
worldwide population and save millions

454
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,800
of deaths

455
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,839
so i actually think i don't know i know

456
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,440
that we sometimes disagree and that is

457
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,279
fine but i think that we always have to

458
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,360
look at the context and the content as

459
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,079
well of

460
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,120
each specific case it cannot be like a

461
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,320
really black and white situation

462
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,600
yes that's actually true context and

463
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,399
content

464
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,720
are of course valuable and yeah it

465
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,000
really depends uh

466
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,160
still i don't like to pay in my opinion

467
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,399
because you're still stimulating

468
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,600
the whole ransomware industry but

469
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,079
i know because maybe if you take this

470
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:00,959
example

471
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,959
the colonial pipeline paid 75 bitcoin

472
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,199
or roughly about 5 million to the

473
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,160
hackers

474
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,119
finally about to stop that crisis more

475
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,400
or less

476
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,319
was that a good thing to do well maybe

477
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,799
yes because otherwise we could

478
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,119
well it could become maybe a much much

479
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,359
bigger crisis of course all over the u.s

480
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,400
so

481
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,599
that could be maybe the reason why we

482
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,919
well we sometimes need to pay but still

483
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,200
i have my doubts about it

484
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,240
i wouldn't do it but yeah of course

485
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,280
um and and and of course uh

486
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,039
there are this is also a very

487
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,320
interesting thing because

488
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,360
it shows as well that well

489
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,080
uh people are looking at it and even uh

490
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,679
the white house is looking at these kind

491
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,360
of things as well these days and that

492
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,400
wasn't the case

493
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,039
years before because now it seems to be

494
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:51,520
become

495
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,840
a very problematic thing if something

496
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,080
like a big pipeline is of course

497
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,480
attacked then of course well of course

498
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,000
the white house comes

499
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,360
around and yeah wants to do much more i

500
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,640
think

501
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,640
isn't that the case we heard uh

502
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,240
absolutely and

503
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,480
uh i am really happy that countries now

504
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,760
start to make like

505
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,720
uh like laws and and regulations and

506
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,160
policies around it

507
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,840
maybe it was long overdue that they

508
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,440
really started to look at the critical

509
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,600
infrastructure and the critical software

510
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,240
and what is really important the supply

511
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,960
chain

512
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,679
because the supply chain is quite often

513
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,320
right now

514
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,640
the most use factor for corpus to get

515
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,679
infected or to

516
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,039
to be abused or misused

517
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,360
well it's a different topic again for a

518
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,640
different presentation

519
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,200
but yeah the critical infrastructure

520
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,520
really needs to be addressed

521
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,559
but eddie i am sorry i interrupted you

522
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,320
you were talking about

523
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,439
ransomware just continue with that

524
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,640
yes so let's continue with uh

525
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,960
well one of the other things we saw as

526
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,480
well well there were also

527
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,440
some um of course hospitals attacked

528
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:03,919
with

529
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,039
um ransomware during the kovite 19

530
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:07,919
period

531
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,640
and even this title came up a patient

532
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,120
dies

533
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,120
after a ransomware attacks hits a

534
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,520
hospital and that was in germany

535
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,640
now this was not the first time

536
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,520
actually if you go back a little bit in

537
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,880
time

538
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,480
we saw a similar thing in 2016

539
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,280
where uh the hollywood presbyterian

540
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,880
medical center for instance

541
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,640
also was attacked and also a lot of

542
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,840
people needed to be

543
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,120
moved out of the hospital to be taken

544
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,440
care of so it was not really the first

545
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,240
time

546
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,440
now let's go back to that sample to

547
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,720
well this title a patient dies

548
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,039
after a ransomware attack so it seems to

549
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,240
be coming from

550
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,200
the transfer attack well isn't that

551
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,919
really so

552
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,120
hold on eddie if he didn't really

553
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,919
die from the ransomware attack that

554
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,679
makes us

555
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,919
at least this title fake news ransomware

556
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,200
is not fake news but

557
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,679
the title on this article is fake news

558
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:12,240
and

559
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,360
that is always worrying me fake news

560
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,360
is not something new we see it every day

561
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,240
actually uh one of the latest fake news

562
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,720
of course

563
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,520
is the conspiracy of 5g causing covet

564
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,880
19.

565
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,120
one of the earlier ones a really early

566
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,720
one was that the plague

567
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,960
was caused by the gutenberg gutenberg

568
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,880
bible being press printed

569
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,520
now that is of course a very interesting

570
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,240
thing

571
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,440
if you know that already then fake news

572
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,720
led to conspiracy

573
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,799
fake news and hoaxes basically we have

574
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,559
to do one thing

575
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,520
if it's fake news or a hoax or about the

576
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,960
covet 19 vaccine

577
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,400
advertisements please please do not

578
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,600
forward these

579
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,559
because forwarding fake news forwarding

580
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,720
hoaxes is actually adding to the problem

581
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,360
and look

582
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,360
we have people starting to trust them

583
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,480
and believe in them

584
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,280
and that is not really a good thing and

585
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,400
a similar thing

586
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,559
with fake news or at least the wrong

587
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,559
news is with tracking apps

588
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,520
tracking apps have some issues or maybe

589
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,360
they had

590
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,840
we have to be careful there as well but

591
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,600
they also have some

592
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,120
purpose yes

593
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,840
they have purpose of course how tracking

594
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,200
ups i

595
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,520
would love to avoid that topic but still

596
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,720
it's very important

597
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,799
and of course we all know how traffic

598
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:37,760
acts

599
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,159
work i suppose so we're not going into

600
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,840
detail about that one

601
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,880
most of the tracking apps works on

602
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,480
through this mechanism actually the

603
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,480
decentralized privacy preserving

604
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,640
proximity tracing which is a very good

605
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,200
kind of thingy

606
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,559
but there is always also a lot of talks

607
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,559
about the challenge of those proximity

608
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,280
apps

609
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,320
and the tracking apps because

610
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
think about this one uh the electric

611
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,000
frontier foundation

612
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,080
put out a couple of things about this

613
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,039
one

614
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,360
because sometimes for instance you could

615
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,880
track somebody or you could

616
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,600
you know be in contact with somebody

617
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,799
which is just you know

618
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,080
next in a car next to you in in stop of

619
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,520
uh some some sign or whatever because

620
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
or there was a roadblock or whatever or

621
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,640
something like that

622
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,799
so there are a lot of things which are

623
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,720
not really causing that you could be

624
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,799
really in real contact with

625
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,600
that person so there is a lot of things

626
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,880
to say about that

627
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,799
and i i i think even well

628
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,039
maybe rickard has even more to say about

629
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,720
it i think

630
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,320
uh absolutely uh i fully agree with you

631
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,360
that we should install

632
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,880
all these kinds of tracking apps as it

633
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,640
can help to have

634
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,480
you feel safe again or to get some

635
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,880
freedom back but i also like to be

636
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,080
warned myself

637
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,600
when i have been in the vicinity of

638
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,320
people that are or have been infected

639
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,240
but i also like to be warned when

640
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,600
something is really wrong

641
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,120
and of course we have to look at the

642
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,880
security and privacy of all these

643
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,799
coveted 19 trackers

644
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,520
there are many problems here you have on

645
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,080
the screen

646
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,799
several of them that had some issues

647
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,480
emphasizing hat

648
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,440
i'm not saying that they're all

649
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,159
completely without issues anymore

650
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,520
but then we simply don't know basically

651
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,280
many people are concerned about the

652
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,919
privacy and the privacy with those

653
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:32,799
trackers

654
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,440
it is one thing in a modern society

655
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,000
privacy

656
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,240
should be granted right and rightfully

657
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,039
so

658
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,039
but are we running the risk of data

659
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,919
exfiltration due to breaking the privacy

660
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,799
many people think uh and are concerned

661
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,919
about the privacy

662
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,240
with the covet 19 tracker and the covet

663
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,720
19 vaccine passport that is coming

664
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,760
right for you wrongfully so besides it

665
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,840
is a means of getting back to

666
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,720
almost normal life many people complain

667
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,320
about their privacy

668
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,840
but they at the same time put their

669
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,919
entire life on facebook instagram tech

670
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,840
talk or other social media

671
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,720
and you have the possibility to not take

672
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,720
the passport there's always the option

673
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,799
of doing a pcr or quick test or not

674
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,279
travel or visit the culture event

675
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,000
realistically of course as it's an app

676
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,760
we will see fake apps too and

677
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,720
that's why we have to be careful be

678
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,279
careful

679
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,320
because they will appear and you should

680
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,039
not load them from unofficial sources

681
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,200
even then when you load them from

682
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,600
official sources you have to be careful

683
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,480
do look at the permissions permissions

684
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,640
that are granted is a really important

685
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,440
aspect

686
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,120
for instance a covert knighting tracking

687
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,480
app does not have to send

688
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,080
sms messages or to make calls

689
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,760
so they do need access to your

690
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,279
microphone either

691
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,200
sorry they do not need to have access to

692
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,400
your microphone either

693
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,720
or your contacts so just paying close

694
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,240
attention to permissions

695
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,279
can already be a big help but the

696
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,080
tracking apps

697
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,480
actually is only one one part

698
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,960
the mobile danger arena is much larger

699
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,919
oh yes mobile dangers well talking about

700
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,679
mobile dangers we didn't talk about it

701
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:16,400
that much

702
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,640
except of the tracking apps of course

703
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,400
but we have other good examples

704
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,240
unfortunately

705
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,080
so these are actually also well

706
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,720
let us say contact tracing apps which

707
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,400
actually didn't do what they wanted to

708
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,559
do or where they shouldn't do

709
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,960
actually this was uh these are examples

710
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,799
of the servers banking trojan for

711
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:37,840
instance

712
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,320
so we saw also a lot of mobile malware

713
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,159
related to kovit 19.

714
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,039
and think about this one kobe locker run

715
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:45,760
somewhere

716
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,720
i can tell you if you want to get rid of

717
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,200
well

718
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,559
run somewhere on your phone

719
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,200
it's really terrible it's not that easy

720
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,880
no really

721
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,200
so think about it twice if you click on

722
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,159
some specific

723
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,799
link on your mobile phone or if you want

724
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:03,679
to install

725
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,120
something do you really need

726
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,679
that app well you should think twice i

727
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,400
think

728
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,159
but we have a lot of other kind of um um

729
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,799
yeah well this kind of sort apps but

730
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,880
also related to even a fake website

731
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,120
there was even a fake website which was

732
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,240
impersonating the government of spain

733
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,600
and you could actually download an uh

734
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,880
an app from that website of course

735
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,960
a fake app or a malicious app of course

736
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,400
because it was actually an android

737
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,760
banking trojan

738
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,799
so be very very carefully if you

739
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,919
want to install some kind of

740
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,880
well kovid 19 related app because it

741
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,440
could be

742
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,120
doing something completely different

743
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,880
but let's first of all or let's finally

744
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,080
go to the conclusion

745
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,240
yes of course every presentation needs

746
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,919
to have a conclusion

747
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,320
as does this presentation we have seen a

748
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,000
lot of examples and a lot of things that

749
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,720
happened

750
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,480
side effects or business as usual

751
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,559
people already did weird things and made

752
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,679
many mistakes

753
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,840
not only in security but also in real

754
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,880
life but

755
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,840
did covet 19 change that did we start to

756
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,600
secure our i.t networks

757
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,559
did we lose privacy that we well to be

758
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,159
honest nothing really changed from an

759
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,679
i.t security point of view it was

760
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:26,960
business as usual

761
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,720
at least for those that were paying

762
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,039
attention it's just for those that were

763
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,320
prompted to act

764
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,559
that were that had some real side

765
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,960
effects

766
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,679
now luckily there are still people that

767
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:40,799
have humor

768
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,760
that is also important you never should

769
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,799
lose your humor but do pay attention

770
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,440
that all said eddie uh what do you think

771
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,640
is a good conclusion to end with

772
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,679
i think the best solution is don't

773
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,640
panic and that's a very good solution

774
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,919
always isn't it

775
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,960
but also you know well

776
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,600
you know it was really business as usual

777
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,520
of course we saw

778
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,480
much more phishing attacks and of course

779
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,200
we saw

780
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,080
much more ransomware attacks and of

781
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,279
course we saw

782
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,760
a lot of well kovit 19 related attacks

783
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,640
but isn't that normal because if there

784
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,440
is a big

785
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,320
kind of thing an event happening it's

786
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,760
always been the case

787
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,440
in history so well this is business as

788
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,080
usual in my opinion

789
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,120
i fully agree

790
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,520
well that all said eddie i want to thank

791
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,000
everyone for watching our presentation

792
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,919
sadly we couldn't do this in person but

793
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,279
gladly we still have a virtual

794
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,320
conference

795
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,240
we are looking forward to a next

796
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,840
in-person first conference

797
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,679
for which we actually have a really

798
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,279
great idea to present

799
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,640
but it will have to be on the stage

800
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,640
otherwise it will not work

801
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,480
in the meantime feel free to send us any

802
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,919
questions you have the email addresses

803
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,039
are up here

words

well let's say it in two words stay

807
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,559
educated

808
