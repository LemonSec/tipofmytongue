1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,000
presentation about my session

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
around insights and forecasts from the

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,440
2020 dbir my name is alex pinto

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,480
and i am the dpir team lead uh

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,560
in verizon right so basically i work

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,680
with the team i

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,320
am the the team manager so to speak

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,800
right

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,720
and uh i make sure that we get this

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,080
report through

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,119
um year after year right so

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,599
i want to talk to you a little bit about

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,840
what we have on the report this year but

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,399
i also want to talk about

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,880
how can we use tools right the vir to

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,640
better understand

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,440
what the high level scenery looks like

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,239
what the high

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,559
level structure of the threat landscape

20
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,920
looks like right

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,399
and it's very important this is one of

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,680
those see the

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,000
see the forest and not the trees right

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,800
and how

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,160
um having such a consistent uh

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,160
database over the years can potentially

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,199
help us

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,520
right kind of prepare and understand a

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,399
little bit better

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,840
right so before we get

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,240
to the meat of it right i really want to

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,760
spend some time talking about

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,960
what is the ddir right so the dbir

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,439
is the data breach investigations report

35
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,400
and it is

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,200
a report that verizon puts together

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,479
every single year

38
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,640
it has been around for 14 years and

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,080
i guess in a nutshell right what we do

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,720
is we collect data from several

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,240
different data contributors

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,159
right and don't get we're very very

43
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,280
thankful to

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,320
uh each and every one of them where

45
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,400
they provide us information about

46
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,640
breaches and instant that have happened

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,920
right so and then we go through a lot of

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,600
work in order to categorize those

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,159
breaches

50
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,280
and then perform analytics and try to

51
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,360
and and put together the report showing

52
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,200
the results of those analytics in a way

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,759
that could

54
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,880
help people understand what they

55
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,560
should or shouldn't do or how to

56
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,840
shape uh their strategy as far as

57
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,799
security

58
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,080
according to what's happening in

59
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,080
in the threat landscape right and um

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,120
we we have

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,160
uh we've had over 5000 breaches analyzed

62
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,040
right almost

63
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,160
80 000 incidents right

64
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,840
and um we're gonna be talking about

65
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,319
again about some some of these results

66
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,840
in the specific framing that we've been

67
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,599
talking about so i just want to

68
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,920
address the the movie distracting thing

69
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,720
on the screen

70
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,280
right every year we put together

71
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,000
something that

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,879
uh a cover that has some significance to

73
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,440
the data

74
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,280
right and this year we've been working

75
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,440
with double pendulums

76
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,280
right each one of these pendulums

77
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,560
represents

78
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,040
a type of breach right we have something

79
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,280
we call the patterns in the dbir

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,840
which means oh these are i mean it's

81
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,239
like easy simple ways to categorize

82
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,040
uh the data right and uh each one of

83
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,200
those pendulums they have different

84
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
weights and lengths based on how

85
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,280
representative they were on the data set

86
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,480
right and really and this is what this

87
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,120
both the cover and the inside covers and

88
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,120
and of course the animation

89
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,040
is meant to represent right if you're

90
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,159
curious about it i'm going to be

91
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,920
repeating those links at the end but

92
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,760
the report is i mean it's very easy to

93
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,959
remember the url

94
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,360
right you can find it there and you can

95
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,799
read more about it

96
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,280
okay but what did we talk about this

97
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,040
year right

98
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,040
so i guess i mean um

99
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,920
the the 2021 report and actually any

100
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,640
report

101
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,239
it's always about the previous year

102
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,159
right and uh

103
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,959
this was a report that we approached

104
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,239
very carefully

105
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,560
given on how different and how

106
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,840
potentially impactful 2020 is right and

107
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,720
i i'm pretty sure uh none of you want to

108
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,879
necessarily revisit 2020 right we're

109
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,680
only going to be

110
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,319
talking on a breach perspective here

111
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,200
right

112
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,480
but uh we were very curious

113
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,760
at the time right and we even put

114
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,799
together

115
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,480
a sort of uh a forecast document

116
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,279
right about august of 2020 where okay

117
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,759
how

118
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,040
could the pandemic and the lockdown

119
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,400
and the acceleration of digital

120
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,560
transformation and

121
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,680
moving forward with the

122
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,400
the moving people to the cloud really

123
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,680
working from home

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,880
right um how how did that

125
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,320
could potentially affect the the overall

126
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,280
threat landscape

127
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,360
and we found some very interesting

128
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,440
things looking at the data right

129
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,120
and this is uh this is a

130
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,320
parallel coordinates chart we i very uh

131
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,919
i used to call this the subway chart

132
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,919
because kind of looks like the tube map

133
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,680
but really the idea here is to

134
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,000
understand what was on top in 2020

135
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,560
on this 20-31 report here right which

136
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,479
ones were the ones

137
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,680
which were the most pervasive right and

138
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,840
fishing has been in the lead for a while

139
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,440
and use of solar gradations has been

140
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,199
going with it

141
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,039
uh and the second spot for a while you

142
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,199
can see ever since 2019

143
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,520
this has been uh what has been on top

144
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,560
right but

145
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,919
i think it's we're going to be talking

146
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,840
about all those things here on the right

147
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,960
side

148
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,639
really the fact that fishing went up 11

149
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,960
is something very significant as far as

150
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,320
uh what 2020

151
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,479
right credentials we're not going to be

152
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,160
talking so much about this increase but

153
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,759
the pervasiveness of it

154
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,720
right i mean we cannot not talk about

155
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,800
ransomware i think it's pretty clear i

156
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,520
assure you this is not going to be the

157
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,960
the only talk you're going to see in

158
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,840
this conference

159
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,759
speaking about ransomware or even the

160
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,759
colonial pipeline thing or any other

161
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,120
high profile

162
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,720
incidents that may have happened why

163
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
between me recording this

164
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,600
right and you folks actually seeing it

165
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,240
right

166
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,160
but it's import it's interesting to see

167
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,360
how much

168
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,039
phishing use of stolen credentials

169
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,400
and ransomware right uh played a

170
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
significant part as far as the top three

171
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,039
here

172
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,680
on different causes of breaches right

173
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,160
and

174
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,240
uh i mean before we dig into the meat

175
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,280
here right

176
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,720
i really want to emphasize um

177
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,199
that those were the top ones right this

178
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,479
is a different way of looking at the

179
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,360
same data

180
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,880
i mentioned the patterns in the

181
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,800
beginning of this presentation right

182
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,039
and this is how the patterns they they

183
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,639
represent themselves right

184
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,080
so in breaches you're going to see

185
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,000
social engineering which is pretty much

186
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,880
anything

187
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,680
with a kind of a social outcome not only

188
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,440
phishing but this is the mail compromise

189
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,400
will fall here

190
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,800
right basic web application attacks

191
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,440
which is

192
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,960
uh i mean by and large income passes

193
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,720
use of stolen credentials and

194
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,280
um against web applications of course

195
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,199
but everything is a web application now

196
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,400
right that's kind of the

197
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,520
the tagline here and uh things like

198
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,599
cloud-based emails right they became

199
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,120
very successful to

200
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
credential abuse and credential stuffing

201
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,080
right it's one of the things we're going

202
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,680
to be talking about

203
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,400
and finally system intrusion where um

204
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,039
where we see things like ransomware what

205
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,080
we were just talking about

206
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,199
this is where our more um

207
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,240
how can i put it advanced right as

208
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,039
people would

209
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,280
would say attacks live right um

210
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,720
also i think one thing that's important

211
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,240
to point out here right we're not going

212
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,599
to be talking about errors in this

213
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,319
presentation

214
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,880
right we're really looking at around

215
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,880
external attackers right and errors

216
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,319
really the essence of errors is that

217
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,000
someone in organization

218
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,840
they did something and and left some

219
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,440
data hanging around and there was a

220
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,319
problem but

221
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,680
it's important to put this in

222
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,360
perspective that the amount of breaches

223
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,560
that happen

224
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,800
uh with errors right because of errors

225
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,120
is almost as big as the amount of

226
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,000
breaches that happen

227
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,759
because of something like a system

228
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,840
intrusion and compromises

229
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,000
compromises with malware and specific

230
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,240
hands up hands behind keyboard hacking

231
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,599
right so it's good to have this

232
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,599
perspective but yeah we're pretty much

233
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,639
going to be focusing

234
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,680
um on the stock trade right and we're

235
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,199
not only going to be focusing on the

236
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,000
stock tree

237
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,840
right we're going to be focusing around

238
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,599
the fact of what

239
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,000
works right because we were talking

240
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,840
about the growth before of fishing

241
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,960
and ransomware right and it's really

242
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,440
much

243
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,080
again it's pretty much a game about

244
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,360
return on investment

245
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,719
right uh one of the things that um

246
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,839
we cannot cannot be emphasized enough as

247
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,599
we're doing this work right

248
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,479
and i'm pretty sure that anybody here he

249
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,080
has that has a background

250
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,279
on law enforcement right or has done or

251
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:47,680
does

252
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,199
work with uh

253
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,560
a nation's cert right they will

254
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,880
clearly understand that there is a very

255
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,320
very much a clear focus

256
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,920
on um finding the shortest path

257
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,440
to to profit so to speak right and uh

258
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,080
this is absolutely 100 percent

259
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,920
represented on the data as we see it

260
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,880
right and i really want to point out

261
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,720
um from here on the next

262
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,160
slide which i'm pulling up right

263
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,440
that it is

264
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,920
a financial gain right so we're going to

265
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,519
be focusing on

266
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,519
specific breaches which have a financial

267
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,519
outcome as i was talking about

268
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,680
and also that came from external like i

269
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,640
mentioned which is

270
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,320
by and large the vast majority

271
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,720
of types of breaches that we see on the

272
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,519
report

273
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,720
right and not only the report but also

274
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,600
i mean this is obviously represented on

275
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,800
uh

276
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,519
with the uh by the data that we get from

277
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,560
our partners

278
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,560
right and uh you were seeing sorry

279
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,360
you were seeing the the the movement

280
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,120
right and really the movement on this

281
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,320
charts are going to see some of these

282
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,600
charts wiggling here

283
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,079
it's just to represent our uncertainty

284
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:10,880
right

285
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,920
and uh i mean everything if anything if

286
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,079
folks have read the dbir before or are

287
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:16,720
interested in

288
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,519
the var we're very much statistic nerves

289
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,000
right

290
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,760
and we like to be very clear about our

291
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,519
biases and statistical errors and things

292
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,079
like that

293
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,560
but even with statistical error even

294
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,079
with all this reading here i mean it's

295
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,320
quite uncontroversial to say that

296
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,480
quite correct even that external and

297
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,600
financial

298
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,959
are gonna win uh the ticket here right

299
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,040
so how do you increase your return on

300
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,680
investment

301
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,519
if you are an attacker and please this

302
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,079
is not please do not take this advice

303
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,160
literally and become an attacker and use

304
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,519
this learnings for

305
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,200
for your or your benefit right but uh

306
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,600
there is there are two main trends which

307
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,519
i mean in retrospect they seem obvious

308
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,959
but it's interesting to see how they

309
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,079
manifest right

310
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,360
you're either going to improve the

311
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,519
processes that you have so you have some

312
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,880
attacks which are simple which are

313
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,800
effective which work very well

314
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,320
that you're going to keep trying to

315
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,920
optimize right

316
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
or the attackers are going to try to

317
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,279
discover some sort of

318
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,399
new type of attack a new methodology

319
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,760
with a high

320
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,040
uh return on investment right and uh i

321
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,760
i don't necessarily mean that something

322
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,560
came up

323
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,360
that something happened right so we we

324
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,480
could talk about

325
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,360
um supply chain breaches but they they

326
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,200
have been happening for a while

327
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,839
that they most of them are still on very

328
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:36,720
much the

329
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,839
espionage bucket i would say right

330
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,279
but um and um it's not so much of the

331
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,320
financial but

332
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,000
we haven't even analyzed those right

333
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,360
this these are going to come up in the

334
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,160
2022 report about the 2021 data

335
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,320
right but um what does an unknown attack

336
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,440
look like what just

337
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,079
what does really shift in the landscape

338
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,959
looks like

339
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,959
and did the landscape shift with kovet

340
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,920
right so one of the things i want to

341
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,560
point out

342
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,200
is that uh one of the ways that

343
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,360
attackers can be more effective

344
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,680
and they are they are trying very much

345
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,880
to be more effective

346
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,160
right is within the the concept of

347
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,880
short attacks right so the shorter the

348
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,240
attack and this is research from the

349
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,160
2020 issue of the ddir

350
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,440
the shorter the attack uh it's cheaper

351
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,560
it's simpler uh for them to

352
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,040
get to their outcome because the less

353
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
the less points where they're visible

354
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,600
right there's less chance for a defender

355
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,399
to find them

356
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,040
right so this is pretty much how many

357
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
steps do you need to be successful

358
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,680
right and and how much

359
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,040
uh how to get to the outcome faster you

360
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,760
see how

361
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,279
they very much concentrate on the

362
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,519
beginning of the number of steps here

363
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,720
per breach right and you don't get that

364
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,519
maybe to

365
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,720
30 or 20 steps right which i mean the

366
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,320
successful ones of course

367
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,399
right so as we talk about those things

368
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,800
which are very known very understand

369
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,320
very understandable and very common

370
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,240
right we really have to talk about this

371
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,360
fishing increase

372
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,399
right and again 11 is nothing to to

373
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,680
sneeze at

374
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,160
so more than a third of all the breaches

375
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,440
that we saw

376
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,639
uh uh that were analyzed on the report

377
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,000
right they were um

378
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,399
they they had a breaching component in

379
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,000
it doesn't mean reaching was the whole

380
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,240
thing right but at least it was a part

381
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,600
of it right

382
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,320
as a bigger role 85 percent of

383
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,639
involve some sort of human element right

384
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,480
and this is a little bit beside the

385
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,839
point i'm trying to make here but it's

386
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,040
important to understand this also

387
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,680
includes

388
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,600
clicking your malware and things like

389
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,040
that right so

390
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,480
the point i want to address here is

391
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
really okay 11

392
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,000
increase this clearly um this clearly

393
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,079
was an impact this clearly was a shift

394
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,079
right and i think you can argue there's

395
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,079
a correlation we can't really

396
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,839
talk about causation right we don't have

397
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,440
another world where the pandemic doesn't

398
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,160
happen

399
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,199
and we cannot measure the changing uh of

400
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,959
of the fishing efficiency there

401
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,680
right but um the the point i'm trying to

402
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,079
argue

403
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,440
here that this was at most

404
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,320
an incremental improvement from the side

405
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,360
of the attacker

406
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,720
right so um i mean specifically in the

407
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,480
beginning of lockdown of course right

408
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,560
there were a lot of fishing lures about

409
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,120
the virus right and about the disease

410
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,160
and about

411
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,320
i mean anything you can imagine right

412
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,000
which had the word scovid or

413
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,800
cure or vaccine and things like that

414
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,519
right

415
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,720
however even those lures right when you

416
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,399
see here in this comparison that we did

417
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,199
and this is from the

418
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,680
that august 2020 uh research that i i

419
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,880
told you guys about

420
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,279
right if something was unrelated at the

421
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,000
time it had a 3.1 success rate

422
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,680
akovid had success rate okay it was

423
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,160
better but it was not

424
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,760
groundbreakingly better right and the

425
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,199
fact of the matter here is that

426
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,760
trends in fishing lures is very much

427
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,800
business as usual

428
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,560
right they will be talking about they

429
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,199
will be discussing whatever

430
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,320
um i mean whatever's trending right they

431
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,000
want people to click so they have to be

432
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,880
topical

433
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,880
uh first and foremost and of course um

434
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,639
back there at the beginning right there

435
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,880
was nothing more topical than this right

436
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,399
i could argue that the increase

437
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,399
of and again this is speculation this is

438
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,079
not something we have data

439
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,959
right and we're definitely not trained

440
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,160
psychologists

441
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,759
right but um it's a it's very

442
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,560
uh possible that uh the increase in

443
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,120
fishing

444
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,360
success had to do with not something

445
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,880
that the attackers did

446
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,040
but more of the the people who were

447
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,000
attacked they had

448
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
so much in their minds right the term

449
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,920
for this would be cognitive overload

450
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,399
right that they were just more likely to

451
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,240
click and start right and of course

452
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,279
this is uh i mean

453
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,680
the pandemic and everything of course

454
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,279
touched everybody's life

455
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,639
right in in a way it equalized everyone

456
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,440
in in a way that i i don't remember in

457
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,880
my lifetime happening

458
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,959
right so it's very easy to understand

459
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,880
why people would be curious why people

460
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,240
would be more distracted

461
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,360
right to use a very understated word um

462
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,399
and of course fail on those tests that

463
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,240
maybe they could have passed right maybe

464
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,600
they wouldn't have clicked

465
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,160
uh on different situations but the point

466
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,079
here is

467
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,600
there was no fundamental change here

468
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,920
this was a honing this was an

469
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,000
improvement right which is the kind of

470
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,079
thing we can we can see

471
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,360
right and we saw here in this specific

472
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,000
uh

473
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,079
case right another one i want to touch

474
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,360
this is of course

475
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,480
uh it has very much to do with phishing

476
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,399
is a credential abuse right and by abuse

477
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,680
it could really be anything

478
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,559
right we don't quite know uh sometimes

479
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,319
we don't quite know if the thing that

480
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:06,880
happened

481
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,880
that happened in a breach was a brute

482
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,720
force attack

483
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,039
or credential stuffing right sometimes

484
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,160
it's clear

485
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,240
uh the the forensic partner who did the

486
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,079
investigation they will draw kill a

487
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,199
clear line to oh there was a phishing

488
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,720
and then the employee entered the

489
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,480
credential and then that credential was

490
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,760
used against

491
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,480
uh the environment right the the

492
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,400
organization right but sometimes it

493
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,440
starts with the

494
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,360
the credential years so nobody really

495
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,080
knows where it came from right but

496
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,600
the point is that 61 is a lot right

497
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,320
61 of all breaches more than half of all

498
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,960
breaches

499
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,799
involved some sort of credential abuse

500
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,480
so think about that on the other way

501
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,919
if we had a perfect record

502
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,559
of creeping keeping credentials safe

503
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:52,960
right

504
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,080
no password reuse 2fa everywhere

505
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,120
right we could potentially have had

506
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,320
61 percent less breaches it's insane

507
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,480
to say that out loud right and

508
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,600
understand how much of an

509
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,559
impact this thing is happening and in

510
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,280
fact

511
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,679
our perception here is really that

512
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,080
this is kind of saturated right there's

513
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,120
no more

514
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,320
nowhere else for credentials to go

515
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,360
right the vast majority of course social

516
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,000
has a lot of credentials are are stolen

517
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,679
all the time right or they potentially

518
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,280
could be reused later

519
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,640
right and uh most of the the

520
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,000
the top two is showing there on

521
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,960
on the pattern slide right uh basic

522
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,400
publication attacks and

523
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,039
and the system into uh intrusion they

524
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,080
use credentials

525
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,919
there's not a lot more that credentials

526
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,400
can go right and in fact

527
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,039
when you do kind of an analysis on how

528
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,480
pervasive these things are

529
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,520
right when you look at exactly the

530
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,000
how many attempts are being made about

531
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,880
companies right

532
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,039
the data we have is just staggering

533
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,960
right to think that

534
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,440
uh 95 this is a and this is a kind of a

535
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,480
uh density chart right but it's it's

536
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,600
called the dot plot

537
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,280
the dots are usually easier to

538
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,960
understand if you think like you're

539
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,520
piling them up like a connect four thing

540
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,000
right

541
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,840
and the colors i meant to be the ones in

542
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
the middle here the the oranges and the

543
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,440
yellows they're more the more common

544
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,480
ones of course

545
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,080
this is i think 75 confidence

546
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,440
right and the the the greens are the

547
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,039
our 25 uh our 95 confidence right so

548
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,799
90 this is not the statistical

549
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,400
definition but the way to understand is

550
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,120
that

551
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,280
95 of everything that happens would fall

552
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,160
between

553
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,559
600 and 3.3 billion but think about that

554
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,720
number 3.3 billion

555
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,960
malicious logins attempts against a

556
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,480
single organization

557
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,120
through a specific year that's 105

558
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,640
attempts per second

559
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,240
right obviously this should be

560
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,840
controlled this is not controlled for

561
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,720
size

562
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,120
but gives you a sense on how pervasive

563
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,320
and how

564
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,640
and how those uh those different things

565
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,159
happen right

566
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,559
so i guess okay if this is incremental

567
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,000
if this is saturation

568
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,200
if this is okay this seems like it's far

569
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,640
uh for the course as business as usual

570
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,720
what does a change look like right what

571
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,960
does an unknown attack what does a new

572
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,240
kind of attack

573
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,799
uh looks like in the environment right

574
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,760
and

575
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,200
this is the part where we talk about

576
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,799
ransomware right

577
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,760
and uh remember crypto mining yeah i

578
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,000
don't

579
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,200
think you do right uh way back when

580
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,240
crypto mining

581
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,840
uh came uh came of age or started

582
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,480
happening

583
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,919
there was a lot of furor uh in the

584
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,360
in the whatever media

585
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,200
thought leadership bubble whatever you

586
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,960
want to call it that this was the next

587
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,679
thing

588
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,159
it was the next ransomware right it was

589
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,840
the next thing that was going to happen

590
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,120
and uh crypto mining definitely didn't

591
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,600
work

592
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,640
quite as well as ransomware or business

593
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,919
email compromise

594
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,039
right the bc acronym there and you can

595
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,320
see over the years

596
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,679
how much they become a part of incidents

597
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,240
right now

598
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,679
ten percentage of all instances are

599
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,840
have some uh business email compromise

600
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,720
like component

601
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,120
or they have a ransomware like component

602
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,080
on it

603
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,159
it's a lot right these numbers are very

604
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,679
very big and i do want to touch that

605
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,280
on the end right we're gonna be talking

606
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,000
about the why 10 percent is so big

607
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,360
um but they

608
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,159
at the end of the day right you have to

609
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,880
understand that

610
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
the trait that businesses may compromise

611
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,960
and ransomware

612
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,080
share is that they make it very easy for

613
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,360
you to monetize

614
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,600
a breach right so if you have enough

615
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,720
information about

616
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,080
an organization or the way an

617
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,840
organization is set up you know who the

618
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,880
cfo is

619
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,880
you know who the ceo is right you know

620
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,320
who an account person or

621
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,720
or a penis person is right you couldn't

622
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,840
weaponize that

623
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,400
with a very well crafted email which

624
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,960
look

625
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,159
it may sound like and this is something

626
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,520
i think we have to be very careful with

627
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,840
right you're like oh who's gonna believe

628
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,000
uh in someone sending an email to pay um

629
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,400
to give money to someone else a lot of

630
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,520
people do

631
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,120
right and most of these people are

632
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,880
afraid for their jobs or something like

633
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,080
that because the ceo

634
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,360
told them they need to wire money

635
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,120
somewhere right we have to understand

636
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,720
with a little bit of empathy

637
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,760
right that somehow the defense and the

638
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,280
understanding here is failing and this

639
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,640
is working very well

640
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,440
right and ransomware it actually uh

641
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,240
makes a different change where

642
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,360
uh breaches getting into the breaches

643
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,000
sometimes

644
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,679
is mostly it's a mostly automated

645
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,600
endeavor right if you have

646
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,760
if you are a honeypot person right if

647
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,760
you have access to a honeypot or

648
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
you you you buy data from some sort of

649
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,760
report or some sort of sharing

650
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,600
i mean everybody will tell you that okay

651
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
everyone at all times is scanning the

652
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,880
whole internet for potential

653
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,840
vulnerabilities

654
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,080
and trying to get into companies right

655
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,840
and there's no one behind a keyboard

656
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,880
they're just like

657
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,520
that they have uh uh the ipv4

658
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,320
they have uh fishing poles on all of the

659
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,440
ipv4

660
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,360
right and someone's gonna buy and then

661
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,559
they're gonna look at that

662
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,799
specific fishing pole that pull and see

663
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,840
what they're going to do

664
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,039
right and before they had to think okay

665
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,799
what is valuable here what would we have

666
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,640
to steal here that could potentially be

667
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,320
sold reused so we could get that

668
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,600
financial gain

669
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,080
now you don't need to think right now

670
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,120
all you need to do

671
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,520
is just press the button and encrypt

672
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,480
everything

673
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,400
right and then you're asking for the

674
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,000
ransom right

675
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,360
in fact you can see this happening

676
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,440
clearly also when you look at the data

677
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,039
from a different direction right

678
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,679
and this is uh uh we're specifically

679
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,240
talking about

680
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,880
outcomes of attributes right so what

681
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,720
exactly was hurt

682
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,760
when uh a breach happened right

683
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,640
and you can see how payment data so the

684
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,320
breach of confidentiality on payment

685
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,159
data here the orange one

686
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,039
was king in 2016 right it was 75

687
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,320
percentage

688
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,799
of outcomes of attributes and breaches

689
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:17,600
had

690
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,760
payment data leakage and it now it lost

691
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,679
uh its its prevalence not only to

692
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:24,960
credentials

693
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,520
right uh reaching another way of getting

694
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,400
into companies

695
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,279
right but also obscuration which is

696
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:31,679
again

697
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,000
an if availability problem which is

698
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,600
pretty much encrypting the data and

699
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,559
making it

700
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,919
unusable right it's clearly

701
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,440
it clearly shows why it has been it has

702
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,440
been successful it's showing the growth

703
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,480
it's easy

704
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,480
right and there's even another way of

705
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,840
looking at it right

706
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,799
is the outcomes right so this is data

707
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,440
from the fbi ic3 that we also analyzed

708
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,960
this year on the dbir

709
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,000
right so let's ignore forensics and

710
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,520
legal guidance here right

711
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,440
this was spot this is part of a bigger

712
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,559
argument but

713
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,840
if you look at ransomware here uh cdb is

714
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,000
computer data breaches the second one

715
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,480
right this is a catch-all that the fbi

716
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,159
has for your traditional

717
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,360
oh someone broke in and stole data or

718
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,039
compromised something right

719
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,640
and this is the mail compromise here on

720
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,559
the top right and

721
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,200
those this chart it represents loss

722
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,919
right so

723
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,080
this is money that has been so

724
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,200
ransomware here that

725
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,799
this is money that has been handed off

726
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,960
to the attacker right

727
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,200
and very likely this is ransom that has

728
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,159
been paid

729
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,120
right and and computer data breaches of

730
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,600
course

731
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,720
um there's some sort of outcome there

732
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,240
and this is a mere compromise as you

733
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,080
would expect someone wired money

734
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,039
somewhere

735
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,279
look they are i mean a million five

736
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,480
1.5 million on the top scale here

737
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,960
on on on computer data breach it's not

738
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,760
so different from

739
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,200
almost a medium in business mayo

740
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,320
compromise and 1.1 million on ransomware

741
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,480
as the worst case scenario for the

742
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,679
the 95 percentile right

743
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,320
and those are easier right those are

744
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:10,799
clearly

745
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,320
simpler uh to get to right

746
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,080
and um and this is where we see

747
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,760
this is this is what changing the

748
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,279
landscape look like right

749
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,240
ransomware wasn't a thing or something

750
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,360
that nobody had

751
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,679
heard of or or hadn't really spent time

752
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:28,720
thinking about

753
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,000
until it was right and here we are but

754
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,679
we can't necessarily tell you what's

755
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,440
going to be the next thing

756
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,600
right but we can clearly understand that

757
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,919
when it hits those marks as in

758
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,080
the outcomes are comparable right it's

759
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,520
actually easier

760
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,080
right to to execute right that's pretty

761
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,840
much where everybody's gonna go

762
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,000
right again everybody has a boss

763
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,760
everybody has a budget they want to get

764
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,720
to the most

765
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,400
potentially um effective way of of

766
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,520
resolving this

767
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,039
right so i'm going to gloss over the

768
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,400
the stock price thing you're going to

769
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,840
have to read the report for that because

770
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,840
that really doesn't help

771
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,960
doesn't have anything to do with this

772
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,880
presentation so i mean enjoy reading the

773
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,640
report and finding that part

774
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,159
so anyway this is the part

775
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,080
no i i am very sorry but this is not the

776
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,880
part

777
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,799
where i tell you how to fix this right

778
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,799
if i knew how to fix this right

779
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,279
we it would be a very different i would

780
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,480
be in a very different place where

781
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,080
potentially all of us would be in a very

782
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,960
different place

783
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,559
right and we would be in a we would be

784
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,039
having to do an understanding a better

785
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:37,840
understanding

786
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,640
of what needs to be done right but i can

787
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,360
provide you

788
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,279
some guidance right which i think is

789
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,640
important and i think that

790
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,840
some of the things that our data

791
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,320
elucidates right

792
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,240
so the first important thing when you're

793
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,679
looking at data breaches and the

794
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,440
potential

795
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,080
outcomes right is understand that nobody

796
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,480
can

797
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,559
do everything no organization can do

798
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,320
everything and this do

799
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,600
is in quotes for a reason right uh in

800
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
the sense that

801
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,200
um you're gonna have to engineer

802
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,840
controls right you cannot engineer

803
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,200
controls for everything

804
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,399
right but if you this one

805
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,000
what this chart represents here right is

806
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,159
one of the kinds of different misuses

807
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,279
that can

808
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,840
happened this past year right and you

809
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,640
can see there's

810
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,399
two main winners here

811
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,399
right which is privilege abuse which by

812
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,159
the way

813
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,760
apparently not a felony anymore

814
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,159
according to the cfaa which is

815
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,360
interesting uh but anyway this is a us

816
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,559
west centric comment or data mishandling

817
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,000
right and then there's a lot of like

818
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,039
five one percents here illicit content

819
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,039
the naomi's use right

820
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,760
and kind of the point here is that look

821
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,600
those things are likely to happen to you

822
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,000
right you're probably want to if you

823
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,279
want to build

824
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,480
something against them right uh in

825
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,320
in specific we're talking about business

826
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,679
here right this is a very this is a

827
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,039
specific example you probably want to

828
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:07,919
look at those two

829
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,080
right the other ones ah they're not

830
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,080
gonna happen right i mean what are the

831
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,200
odds of one percent

832
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,600
i can i can handle those odds right but

833
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,360
when you collapse this

834
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,360
you understand thinking about our top

835
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,640
two right

836
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,960
the chance of something else happening

837
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,919
to you

838
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,760
right the other here which is again the

839
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,600
sum of all of the other ones and and

840
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,840
some others that are hidden

841
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,559
it's the same as this is actually

842
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,320
statistically the same as the second one

843
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,520
here

844
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,720
right so now what right if this becomes

845
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
the most likely one or the second most

846
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,559
likely one how do i handle

847
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,840
against other right and

848
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,600
the the bad news is that

849
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,080
everything is like this on our data set

850
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,000
right we spent some time

851
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,279
uh uh calculating the gini coefficient

852
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,919
right and some of you folks who are like

853
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,080
economic buffs might recognize it from

854
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,799
like

855
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,679
income inequality analysis right and

856
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,520
really trying to understand how much of

857
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,240
this

858
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,159
how much of breaches are concentrated on

859
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,440
specific

860
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,399
actions or specific things right those

861
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,360
numbers are very

862
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,559
high right those numbers they sit

863
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,159
um between i mean i believe 75

864
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,279
um 74 to 85 right

865
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,559
where 100 would be uh everything

866
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,600
is very unequal right so one one

867
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,640
variety has everything and where zero

868
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,360
would be

869
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,440
all the varieties everything has the

870
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,039
same chance of happening across the

871
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:39,600
board

872
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,919
right so this is not just a misuse

873
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,200
problem which is the one i used to

874
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,000
illustrate this

875
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,240
this is a problem everywhere right so i

876
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,000
mean do your best

877
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,960
uh bernie sanders or jeremy corbyn voice

878
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,640
right and read that the top three

879
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,600
percent of our rights

880
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,159
are responsible for 87 of the breaches

881
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:56,720
right

882
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,000
so you may think oh yeah

883
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,399
so that kind of gives me a pass right

884
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:03,279
because

885
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,519
uh i mean maybe if i focus on the top

886
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,360
three percent of varieties and

887
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,640
the truth that's not true either right

888
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,880
something is going to happen right we

889
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,080
were talking before

890
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,640
about specific focuses on ransomware and

891
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,000
specific focuses

892
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,039
on business email compromise right

893
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,679
um this is an analysis across the whole

894
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:24,480
data set

895
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,320
every single possible outcome we had on

896
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,519
the dbir

897
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,240
using simulated cost simulated total

898
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,600
costs for breaches

899
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,039
right you're looking at at again the 95

900
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:35,919
percentile

901
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,960
something between um eight um

902
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,080
800 and 65 000

903
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,039
as your potential outcome you're gonna

904
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,000
get owned

905
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,159
right and it doesn't matter it's not

906
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,919
gonna be just by those things

907
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,960
right so it becomes really a problem of

908
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,960
how to handle how to handle those

909
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,200
specific things and the

910
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,559
the helpful and helpful guidance

911
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,559
that we may provide here that i may

912
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,640
provide here is really that the way you

913
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,840
should think about this

914
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,120
is that there is a norm right there is

915
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,840
something that

916
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,039
happens there's something that is

917
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,120
expected to happen right and this is

918
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,799
kind of the work that we try to do in

919
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,760
the dbir

920
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,840
show you what's more likely to happen

921
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,000
right these are 100

922
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,880
the ones you should engineer for right

923
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,440
so

924
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,200
i have a specific amount of budget

925
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,559
there's something

926
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,440
i can only do this much right to build

927
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,039
specific defenses right

928
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,360
you should be looking at your industry

929
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,120
uh your industry vertical you should be

930
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,320
looking at the

931
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,399
maybe regions as well as the dbr has

932
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,159
that breakdown right and say okay

933
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,200
these are the things that shoot

934
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,440
engineering from those three i mentioned

935
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,880
credentials

936
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,159
uh phishing and ransomware are 100

937
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,320
what you should be building against the

938
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,000
better the better possible way right

939
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,919
these are across the board

940
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,039
uh very popular in the worst terrible

941
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,240
sense of the word

942
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,519
right and they just happen a lot but

943
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,200
uh there's all the other things and you

944
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,559
cannot you cannot

945
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,399
train for those you cannot engineer for

946
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,320
those right you have to have people who

947
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,880
are versatile have have some sort of ops

948
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,440
right uh that will be able to some sort

949
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,279
of uh response team that would be able

950
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,880
to handle those things right

951
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,679
they won't be as frequent as the other

952
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:20,159
ones

953
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,760
but when they happen you're gonna need

954
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,919
some sort of like quick thinking

955
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,840
thinking on your feet

956
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,039
in order to be able to handle them right

957
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,640
so anyway let me just go back to the

958
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,279
slides here

959
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,200
what and while we're talking about

960
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,279
engineering right i just want to again

961
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,960
hone in on to some of the

962
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,799
recommendations we put on the report

963
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,960
right and again we kept it very short

964
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,399
this year because we want to really

965
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,840
really focus on the things that were

966
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,200
really really bad

967
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,440
right and we're really talking here

968
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,399
about

969
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,159
although there are four controls the two

970
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,519
in the middle

971
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,519
are very much impacting credential

972
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,120
stuffing and credential reuse

973
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,720
right so these should kind of address

974
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,240
the credential problem

975
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,760
secure configuration of enterprise

976
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,679
assets and softwares can mitigate not

977
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,719
only against

978
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,280
malware but also against errors right

979
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,040
and of course security awareness is

980
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,719
skill training could potentially help

981
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,199
with the the fishing the fishing

982
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:21,119
outcomes right and it's something that

983
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,879
i'm not gonna say it's forgotten i think

984
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,800
everybody has been doing a good work

985
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,320
on i mean there's fishing simulation

986
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,679
companies all those sorts of different

987
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,639
things right this is

988
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,079
very much at the forefront of what

989
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,679
people do but

990
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,440
um this is clearly a problem this is

991
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,800
really something that needs to be

992
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,239
continuously

993
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,760
uh improved and uh continuously finding

994
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,280
new ways to do better

995
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,480
against this so anyway that's kind of

996
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,639
the presentation uh before i close off i

997
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,000
just want to give a shout out

998
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,320
to the dbir authors it's actually a team

999
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,280
of five people

1000
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,639
who you may or may not know i'm very

1001
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,960
very thankful and honored to be a part

1002
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,079
of the team here

1003
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,000
right and um i i'm gonna leave you with

1004
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,880
this resource page right which kind of

1005
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,880
links you to the report links you to the

1006
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,720
the data breach landscape for code 19

1007
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,599
would you publish

1008
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,440
on august right you guys might be

1009
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,960
interested in looking at that as well

1010
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,400
right um if you're interested in

1011
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,119
oh but this data looks neat what what do

1012
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,480
they call hacking what is this thing

1013
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,440
privilege abuse right the standard we

1014
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,320
use for

1015
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,320
bridge classification is called varus

1016
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,240
right you can follow that link there as

1017
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,160
well to learn a little bit more about it

1018
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,560
