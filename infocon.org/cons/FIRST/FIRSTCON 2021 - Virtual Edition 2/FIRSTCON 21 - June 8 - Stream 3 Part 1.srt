um recommend to join the q a

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,439
and the social spaces in work adventure

27
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,200
that was a lot of fun yesterday um

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,960
and now i'd like to introduce

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,799
kuniko yoshimura he is a cyber security

30
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,159
researcher from

31
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,360
fujitsu system integration laboratories

32
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,280
and he has many years of experience as a

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,280
security analyst and researcher

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,439
he spoke at first the first conference

35
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,960
in 2018

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,280
about multi-dimensional malware

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,200
similarities

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,040
s4 and in this talk how to apply

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,880
machine learning the appropriate way for

40
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,560
our security operation

41
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,200
he will present the best practice on how

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,040
machine learning should be applied

43
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,040
using this sample similarity scoring

44
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,799
system improvements

45
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,960
as an example um and apply those methods

46
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,079
in in your environment

47
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,799
to improve operations so this should be

48
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,799
very interesting

49
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,160
uh so go ahead thank you yeah

50
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,200
thank you margaret hi there

51
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,239
i am a kunichiko yoshimura from 52

52
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,120
system integration laboratories

53
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,000
i'm happy to be speaking at this

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,440
conference

55
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,959
today i will be giving a talk titled

56
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,120
how to apply machine learning

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,599
appropriate way for security operation

58
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,319
this page is about me i have been

59
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:36,959
working

60
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,239
in the security field for 10 years

61
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,720
i have been doing security operations

62
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,519
for four

63
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,560
years and security research for

64
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,319
six years so i have a good understanding

65
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,519
of both the operations and the research

66
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,280
cultures

67
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,120
as a result of my research i gave a talk

68
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,720
at the first settings annual conference

69
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,840
three years ago i'll talk about it later

70
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,680
based on my experience in

71
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,400
in security operation

72
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,599
uh under knowledge from research

73
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,879
institute

74
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,599
i would like to introduce a recommended

75
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,319
method

76
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,280
that also can be easily used in your

77
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,159
field

78
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,120
okay number one is uh introduction

79
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,040
in the security operation field security

80
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,760
operations

81
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,959
center suck has some missions

82
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,480
for defending organization one of them

83
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,840
is to monitor errors and events

84
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,360
and to alert the incident for ir

85
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,040
team or customers

86
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,640
another one is manage security operation

87
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,439
seats

88
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,799
like firewalls suck

89
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,040
is the front line in the security

90
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,080
defense

91
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,360
and like a star player in managed

92
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,560
security services

93
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,120
soc also has implemented

94
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,560
important tasks to complete

95
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,240
these missions one of them

96
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,440
is to maintain signature rules

97
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,199
of sensors or seams

98
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,880
purposes are to ignore false positive

99
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,520
removable order vulnerability rules that

100
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,800
didn't

101
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,840
exist in the period and

102
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,919
at the signature route that are

103
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,759
appropriate for operations

104
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,040
sock team is always busy

105
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,160
with monitoring and managing

106
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,199
however they should spend more time for

107
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,400
maintaining

108
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,479
maintaining the rules otherwise

109
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,440
unanimous cannot response alerts

110
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,960
effectively

111
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,160
as a result he will not be able to keep

112
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,039
up with it

113
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,440
this diagram is a structural system

114
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,039
in my presentation at three years ago

115
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,759
i developed sample similarity scoring

116
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,400
system

117
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,919
s4 which determine most

118
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,560
similar known malware pieces for new

119
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,120
malware

120
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,039
this tool divides the 17 similarity

121
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,479
truth into three categories

122
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,880
surface dynamic and geometric

123
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,199
integrates the similarity square using

124
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,199
square transformation in each category

125
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,960
and output a result

126
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,240
in a ranking format

127
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,960
i talked about the effectiveness of a

128
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,280
multi-dimensional evaluation by

129
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,440
integrating mario similarity through

130
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,240
scrolls

131
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,680
s4 succeeded clustering pieces of

132
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,600
mario as mario permeates effectively

133
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,600
and support mario analyst by reducing

134
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,960
analysis time

135
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,080
the expo is a useful too but

136
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,199
had the different difficult uh

137
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,479
difficult to tune problem

138
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,960
it is necessary to spend a time for

139
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,000
maintenance tuning

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,520
parameter that used in the

141
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,720
square transformation when i

142
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,919
integrated 17 two

143
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,960
squares for three dimensions

144
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,319
i set parameter of piecewise linear

145
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,720
transformation

146
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,720
plt for all of the tools

147
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,880
prt is flexible for human thinking

148
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,919
but it is complex

149
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,479
it needs much time for setting the

150
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,440
appropriate

151
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,840
parameter in short this tool gave

152
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,280
an analyst time reduction

153
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,720
but also time increase

154
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,160
that is a fatal program

155
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,639
in this chapter i'll talk my approach

156
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,919
that i try to apply machine learning for

157
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,800
maintaining

158
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,400
automatically tuning parameters in

159
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,919
each step i will talk about basic stance

160
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:48,240
for

161
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,759
applying machine learning and examples

162
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,560
i experienced in s4 case

163
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,840
first step also most

164
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,440
important step we should pick a set

165
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,479
of goods for machine learning

166
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,280
in other words it is a planning for

167
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,840
machine learning

168
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,840
at first we decide type of machine

169
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,039
learning

170
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,160
in general there are three types that

171
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,199
be known well supervised running

172
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:28,800
unsupervised running and reinforced

173
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,400
riding

174
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,440
there are three important points

175
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,799
first it's the defining

176
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,599
a cost function for machine learning

177
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,360
of course the status that cannot be

178
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,480
judged by human being it's

179
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,399
neither by a machine

180
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,200
secondly what is the data you can

181
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,920
prepare

182
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,199
in the learning

183
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,720
you must prepare the data you refer

184
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,760
in the operation and

185
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,680
to discriminate the types of

186
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,720
the data that is

187
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,920
explained next slide

188
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,839
okay sadly is of explain

189
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,360
explanation recently

190
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,959
advanced algorithms like deep learning

191
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,000
is coming in the world

192
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,440
however in the secret operation i don't

193
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,560
recommend that techniques is too

194
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,040
advanced to control by a human

195
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,279
because it often looks at critical

196
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,519
responsibility

197
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,279
in our operation so you should choose

198
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,240
simpler algorithm like regression

199
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,959
analysis

200
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,040
there are two main categories of data

201
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,320
quantitative is a data that changes in

202
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,320
a gradient such as days

203
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,600
or event counts

204
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,720
qualitative is digital such as

205
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,760
on and off

206
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,320
or one and zero

207
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,680
it is important to be aware of which

208
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,240
category the data to be trained

209
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,600
will be

210
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,680
in the expo case squads from several

211
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,920
tours can be prepared

212
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,800
to create an integrated school

213
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,240
this are quantitative data

214
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,680
yes however without pld

215
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,200
we should not prepare integrated scores

216
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,360
for learning in advance

217
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,079
we need to change our thinking

218
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,680
what could i use to prepare the data for

219
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,160
running

220
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,519
the answer is as two pieces of

221
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,200
malware that scores that

222
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,800
same family or different

223
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,600
this is qualitative data because there

224
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,560
are two

225
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,920
are only two ports same and different

226
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,480
in the supervised learning we choose

227
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,519
predicting in a single variable

228
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,279
from module multiple variables

229
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,200
in called multivariable analysis

230
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,160
select the appropriate algorithm by

231
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,040
applying

232
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,160
it to the type of the data

233
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,760
we have just organized

234
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,240
yes this is a case of ether

235
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,000
i chose to use logistic regression

236
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,760
i identified the tools that score

237
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,600
high only for the same family

238
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,279
and then finds a coefficient

239
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,800
that minimizes the distance between them

240
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,399
and the logistic function i mean

241
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,160
i changed square transformation logic

242
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,519
from plt to logistic function

243
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,560
the logistical regression feature is

244
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,560
that the data that was qualitative

245
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,600
at training will be between

246
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,480
1 and 0 in the prediction phase

247
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,600
that is quantitative data

248
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,320
this algorithm is highly recommended

249
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,120
because of

250
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,800
its personality this is because

251
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,639
in the field of secret operation

252
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,480
situations sometimes occur such as

253
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,600
the past data is clearly malicious

254
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,279
and benign however in the projection

255
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,000
stage

256
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,160
we want to predict the priority metric

257
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,839
for responding first

258
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,160
okay step three uh let's code it

259
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,360
i chose to use python uh

260
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,480
because of uh it's versatility

261
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,760
but i think you can use any language

262
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,519
that suits your environment

263
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,440
the code in python is very simple to put

264
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,240
together

265
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,440
just do a fit and predict

266
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,760
two lines of coding under you are done

267
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,760
congratulations

268
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,120
however merely implementing

269
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,639
machine learning is not the goal

270
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,639
rather this is just a starting point

271
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,399
i will explain the actual hurdles

272
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,600
i encountered when applying it

273
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,000
and how i jumped over then

274
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,680
okay chapter three is trial

275
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,239
and errors these huddles

276
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,760
huddle number one is a low winning rate

277
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,040
first i used data from

278
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,279
a test i did three years ago to see if

279
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,720
i could successfully group them

280
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,079
as a result uh while maria farmi didn't

281
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,880
did not recognize many samples correctly

282
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,199
uh we will look at the output data

283
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,560
to find the codes

284
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,519
that the red text on the screen shows

285
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,320
that

286
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,079
the coefficient of one source

287
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,120
is a negative number

288
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,320
uh this means that

289
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,759
the higher the score the more different

290
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,759
the family we examine

291
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,959
the correlation value between the target

292
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,839
variable

293
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,720
and the explanatory variables of the two

294
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,720
correlation bar is an indicator of

295
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,600
how much these two variables are related

296
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,399
and the correlation value is 0.49

297
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,680
a positive number uh which means that

298
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,720
as the one increases that the

299
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,560
other also tends to increase

300
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,839
why is this when

301
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,160
we look at other explanatory variables

302
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,839
we found that there was a very strong

303
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,480
correlation with another explanatory

304
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,399
variable

305
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,759
this problem is called marginal

306
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,040
linearity

307
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,399
and it is one of the problems that must

308
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,440
be avoided

309
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,839
in various machine learning

310
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,800
there are several countermeasures a

311
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,839
simple solution

312
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,440
is to disable one of the correct data

313
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,079
created data but in this case

314
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,600
it could be extreme data so

315
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,959
we try to solve this problem by

316
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,199
dimensional compression

317
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,959
in pca principle of component

318
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,480
analysis a theory of

319
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,000
efficient dimensional remake

320
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,839
there is a metric called the explanation

321
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
ratio mainly try to

322
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,880
represent three uh just three

323
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,000
tools in three dimensions and

324
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,520
put those demand dimensions together

325
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,799
efficient

326
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,880
effect efficiently in pca

327
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,360
we are able to represent 97

328
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,559
of the original data in the

329
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,840
two-dimensional states

330
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,600
we thought that if we could truncate

331
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,120
the remaining percentage and perform

332
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,000
regulation

333
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,280
analysis to restore the original

334
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,400
dimensions

335
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,600
we would be able to obtain results

336
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,480
that you are not affected by multiple

337
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,200
linearity

338
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,679
okay huddle number three in further

339
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,280
testing

340
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,320
i increased the number of families to be

341
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:16,960
trained

342
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,640
to 10. this seems

343
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,919
to work fine but

344
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,960
then i run the calculation with

345
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,559
these parameters i only got

346
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,400
42 points even if i got a perfect

347
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,240
score with all the tools

348
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,320
assuming that there are two samples in

349
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,559
each of the 10 families

350
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,280
the number of combinations with

351
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,480
different family

352
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,679
is 4500

353
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,760
and the same families is 450.

354
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,559
if the data you want to train is

355
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,280
extremely skewed

356
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,280
the results will have to

357
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,679
be skewed to that side

358
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,760
this is called imbalanced data

359
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,000
the solution is simple adjust the amount

360
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,520
of correct rate

361
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,720
increasing the amount of correct data is

362
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,080
all called over sampling and

363
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,360
decreasing the amount of incorrect

364
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,280
data is called under sampling

365
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,720
python already has a variety of

366
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,640
logic modules like saktra available

367
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,559
for this purpose you can choose the

368
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,640
appropriate logic based on the nature

369
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,600
of your data and sometimes by

370
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,760
benchmarking

371
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,799
each of them

372
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,440
next hurdle on the left side of the

373
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,080
screen

374
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,000
is the ranking result of the one of the

375
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,679
three trick box

376
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,520
samples normally we would like to

377
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,520
see trick board at the top of the list

378
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,720
but there are many different types of

379
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,960
mario in the mix in case like

380
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,640
this we examine the

381
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,840
squares of each tool on the sample

382
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,039
visual visualization is useful

383
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,480
for examining the characteristic

384
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,120
of data we if we examine the

385
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,880
distribution of squares

386
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,919
output by one of the tools

387
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,520
on the right side of the screen

388
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,280
we can see that squares for different

389
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,159
combinations have a single mountain

390
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:02,799
saturn

391
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,880
at 40 percent and the squares

392
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,440
for the same combination have two

393
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,640
mountains

394
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,480
uh one saturn at 80 percent

395
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,320
and the other at the 20 percent

396
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,600
uh if we focus on this 80 percent

397
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,480
mountain

398
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,520
we can do machine learning that clearly

399
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,280
captures

400
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,400
the futures but

401
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,360
machine learning evaluates both mountain

402
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,480
equally

403
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,679
and judges them as

404
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,880
features this problem

405
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,480
is not a general hub

406
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,480
general name i called this program

407
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,600
data overlap

408
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,039
as other countermeasure processing

409
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,400
is performed define something

410
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,240
like what data should be ignored

411
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,120
and in this case ignore the same

412
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,240
combination of

413
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,760
data that is less than

414
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,200
the average of a different combination

415
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,760
of data

416
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,600
this way each of them will become one

417
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,640
mountain

418
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,480
and the two will identify them as a

419
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,120
feature group

420
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,440
now we'll verify that that

421
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,080
the machine learning system we've worked

422
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,880
so hard

423
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,400
to create work properly

424
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,880
first step is the select target tomorrow

425
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,840
families and

426
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,440
retrieve sample randomly we identified

427
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,360
some valuable families

428
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,559
that were popular at that

429
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,200
at the time from the monthly reports

430
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,880
prepared by

431
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,240
the center for internet security

432
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,320
and security uh cis

433
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,880
obtained malware has value from the

434
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,440
information provided by

435
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,440
the cti vendor and downloaded

436
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,440
the samples from virustotal

437
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,840
next compare samples between different

438
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,400
monsters average them arrange

439
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,240
them in chronological order learn

440
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,600
from the past malware and predict

441
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,880
from the future malware finally

442
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,080
evaluation outputs verify uh

443
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,200
that clustering is working uh

444
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,240
by the correct rate and another node

445
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,559
graph

446
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,240
to determine the target marijuana

447
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,240
families i referred to

448
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,320
the monthly reports published by cgis

449
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,360
i chose mario families that

450
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,760
had up appeared in the rankings at

451
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,279
least five times in the seven months

452
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,159
reports

453
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,039
at that time

454
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,679
we randomly selected from a hash risk

455
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:16,840
based on the

456
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
cti of seven selected

457
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,120
mario families and downloaded the

458
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,480
samples

459
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,039
pre present in bios total

460
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,000
this page shows the correct thread from

461
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,120
each mario

462
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,440
which is a quantitative evaluation

463
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,720
result

464
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,679
for reference at the correct rate of a

465
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,440
commercial mario similarity

466
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,880
service is also shown

467
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,240
this service uh has not only

468
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,360
the sim uh similarity between samples

469
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,400
but also the master data of malware

470
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,440
families

471
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,840
and uh benign software like microsoft

472
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,080
binaries

473
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,679
so the value of the service cannot be

474
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,240
measured

475
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,279
by just this

476
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,840
the extra total correct rate is

477
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,200
76 percent which means

478
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,520
that the accuracy of escrow shimmy id

479
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,880
is compatible to that

480
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,159
of commercial services

481
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,520
uh this is a qualitative evaluation

482
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,279
with an autograph showing a relationship

483
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,559
of 19 19 plus

484
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,520
points or more f4 uh connected samples

485
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,640
of the same family successfully in the

486
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,520
most of

487
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,720
cases overall

488
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,080
we can say that the s4 tuning automation

489
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,559
was

490
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,840
a success

491
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,200
okay chapter five conclusion

492
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,799
as for uh which i have just introduced

493
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,279
has a pork ready to be provided

494
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,400
we are discussing the possibility of

495
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,840
making it open source carefully

496
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,080
because of the risk of uh

497
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,279
it's falling into the hands of malware

498
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,600
developers

499
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,880
if you are interested in s4

500
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,320
i can make it available to you

501
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,039
via github after signing on dna

502
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,720
please contact it

503
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,480
okay conclusion uh my takeaway

504
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,080
message is the procedures in

505
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,200
this talk uh should should

506
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
help you improve your security

507
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,720
oppression with

508
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,919
machine learning in the social

509
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:02,720
cooperation

510
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,000
and i need to spend a long time for

511
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,120
tasks like maintaining signature rules

512
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,720
otherwise you must respond to many

513
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,880
others including many unnecessary ones

514
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,159
i served s4 issues in the same

515
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,840
way as mentioned above

516
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,039
with machine learning

517
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,399
ok thank you for listening

518
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,600
right thank you very much that was uh

519
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,840
that was very interesting

520
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,039
um and to all of you

521
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,600
attending uh i'd like to remind you that

522
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,200
there will be a q a

523
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,440
immediately following this presentation

524
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,360
in work adventure

525
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,880
so there's a there's a

526
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,799
separate room where you can enter with

527
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,320
your avatar and

528

537
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,240
this session

538
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,640
uh there will be a q a immediately

539
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,159
following this presentation in work

540
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,200
adventure

541
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,640
uh the virtual social platform where you

542
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,159
also find the exhibitors

543
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,000
and social activities

544
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
um and it's my pleasure to

545
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,200
introduce simon cannon he is a

546
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,360
independent security researcher and

547
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,760
well-known in the security community

548
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,200
he has a broad experience in

549
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,760
vulnerability analysis malorial

550
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,720
analysis forensics analysis and

551
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,159
developing detection

552
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,559
logic as well as keeping track of the

553
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,440
exploit market and the work

554
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,279
world of web exploitation

555
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,399
um today we will learn

556
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,919
uh about what a carrier-grade nut is

557
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,399
what the risks and dangers are of being

558
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,159
part of such a nuts

559
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,840
especially during a pandemic

560
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,600
so um over to you simon

561
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,039
thank you um

562
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:51,840
just let me share my screen first

563
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:05,840
it's kind of hard with multiple screens

564
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,080
okay so hello everyone

565
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,679
i hope you are doing well during those

566
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,519
essential times

567
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,279
thank you for joining me today for my

568
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,120
talk about cgn

569
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,039
will not carry great problems

570
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,080
this is my main agenda for the talk i'll

571
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,360
start with some introduction

572
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,039
about some basic concepts of the

573
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:33,120
internet then i will explain what is cgm

574
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,519
later i will tell you why it is dead and

575
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,440
what we can do to minimize the problems

576
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,320
or even fix them

577
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,320
this is agenda for the introduction this

578
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,399
is not a very technical talk

579
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,760
but i do cover sorry but i do cover

580
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,880
many topics in order to get to my point

581
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,240
so i hope you will keep up and learn

582
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,120
some new things today

583
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,919
as mentioned my name is simon i am 34

584
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:00,799
years old

585
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,559
i do my lauren equity research for clear

586
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,880
skyber for clear sky cyber security in

587
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,919
israel

588
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,600
and this presentation has nothing to do

589
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,519
with this kind of work

590
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,440
i've been hacking and passionate about

591
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,120
information security since the age of

592
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,720
13.

593
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,000
i had a pv6 on my windows xp with 46

594
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,360
426 tunnel in 2007

595
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,120
and i allegedly did some interesting

596
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,918
things over the years

597
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,480
in this talk we are going way back to

598
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,760
the 80s when the pb4 became standard

599
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,399
we slowly progressed until today to see

600
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,039
what happened

601
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,919
and where we went wrong

602
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
the internet was built on the end-to-end

603
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,000
principle

604
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,360
which is simple data between two devices

605
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,200
should be sent as is without any

606
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,360
manipulation on the way

607
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,840
otherwise our connection is not private

608
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,760
and we can't rely on the data to be

609
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,360
secure and authentic

610
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,440
this is a diagram of how end-to-end

611
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,279
should look like

612
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,600
according to the principle the network

613
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,600
is only responsible for providing the

614
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,840
terminals with connections

615
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,399
any kind of intelligence should be

616
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,799
located at the terminals

617
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,279
an example for such intelligence is

618
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,039
modifying a packet area

619
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,240
like destination or source back in the

620
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,200
80s

621
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,840
computers were big and expensive and not

622
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,039
a common commodity like today

623
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,679
even at a later point each house didn't

624
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,840
have more than one computer

625
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,840
this computer wasn't necessarily

626
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,679
connected to the internet

627
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,840
and if it was it wasn't 24 7.

628
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,720
at some point people had more than one

629
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,480
computer at the house

630
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,559
but they had only one telephone or cable

631
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,919
line

632
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,679
there was the need to connect multiple

633
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,840
computers to the same external line

634
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,960
in order to do so natto is created

635
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,200
it maps multiple addresses to a single

636
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,519
point by modifying the headers of the

637
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,919
packets

638
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,159
this behavior breaks the end-to-end

639
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,120
principle

640
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,839
because it plays intelligence but we

641
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,359
control the nut device

642
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,199
so it should be okay as long as we

643
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,759
control it

644
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,199
in this diagram we can see a home

645
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,199
computer which is part of a local

646
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,320
network

647
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,239
trying to communicate with the server on

648
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,399
the public internet

649
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,000
the nut changes the addresses

650
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
accordingly so the router

651
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,079
could draw the packets back and forth to

652
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,199
the right destination

653
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,319
inside the local network

654
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,679
at some point the internet becomes so

655
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,639
popular

656
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,918
there was a fear it will be

657
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,520
overpopulated by subscribers

658
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,599
this is because each subscriber should

659
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,918
have a unique ipv for others

660
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,159
and the ipv4 pool size wasn't big enough

661
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,159
in the days of the dialogue moderns

662
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,359
those did the funky noises on dialing

663
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,079
isps started to give dynamic ids to

664
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,920
subscribers

665
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,839
this allowed isps to have more

666
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,079
subscribers than it is

667
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,760
because not everyone were connected at

668
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,839
the same time

669
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,760
but if there was no free ip address you

670
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,119
simply could dial in

671
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,440
and use the internet and then someone

672
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,560
will disconnect

673
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,640
or the sp would purchase more ap

674
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,118
addresses

675
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,160
the depletion was anticipated since the

676
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,520
80s

677
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,079
today there are great markets to buy or

678
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,400
release ipv4 addresses

679
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,480
because all ipv4 space has been

680
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,920
allocated and issued already

681
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,160
let's go back to our timer in 94

682
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,720
nut was proposed and we all use not

683
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,119
nowadays one way or another

684
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,480
only two years later in 96 ipv6 was

685
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,760
proposed

686
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,359
in order to overcome the issues with

687
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,800
ipv4 and to eliminate the need for not

688
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,160
so we could restore the android

689
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,800
principle of the internet

690
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,240
unfortunately we are now in 2021

691
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,160
and we didn't fully adopt ipv6 instead

692
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,839
cgn was created and it is widely adopted

693
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,839
today

694
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,440
cgn is basically a large scale knot

695
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,520
that's a sp control

696
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,720
ejp in this line belong to a subscriber

697
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,400
which also might have their own

698
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,960
controlled knot

699
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,599
cgi was created because at some point

700
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,839
people not only had personal computers

701
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,480
they had to connect to the internet they

702
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,280
had mobile phones with data plans

703
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,520
those phones will dial in when internet

704
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,119
was needed

705
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,119
but later on we started to have

706
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,400
smartphones

707
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,119
that are 24 7 connected all those

708
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:49,920
devices

709
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,640
need ap addresses which mobile carriers

710
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,720
couldn't provide

711
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,839
if you didn't know 95 percent of mobile

712
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:58,800
traffic in the world

713
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,079
is behind cgm if you have a smartphone

714
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:08,320
congratulations you most likely cgn

715
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,280
in this diagram of cgn we can see the

716
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,400
subscribers

717
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,160
have full control over the private

718
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,760
employee space

719
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,839
until it leaves their home equipment and

720
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,200
goes to the private ep space of the asp

721
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,920
we don't control the carrier not at all

722
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,720
therefore

723
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,480
this might be risky you can compare

724
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,240
isp to a bank all customers

725
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,560
hope the bank will keep their money safe

726
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,880
their rules and regulations for the

727
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,040
most of the countries but this is not

728
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,000
the case with cgn

729
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,440
so what do we do is there are no ipv4

730
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,720
addresses left

731
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,640
and cgn doesn't seem like a good

732
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,040
solution

733
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,480
if you've forgotten already in 96 ipv6

734
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,000
was proposed

735
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,119
in 98 it became a draft standard it was

736
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,280
meant to fix all this nonsense

737
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,240
ipv6 can provide a unique external ipv6

738
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:08,880
address

739
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,280
to all your internet connected devices

740
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,079
and restore

741
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,040
the android principle of the internet

742
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,000
four years ago

743
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,040
in 2017 ipv6

744
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,280
finally becomes standard official

745
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,960
standard by the internet engineering

746
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,599
task force

747
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,760
if ipv6 is so great you would expect it

748
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,440
to be widely adapted after four years

749
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,880
unfortunately we are in 2021

750
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,599
we have no internet connected cars yet

751
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,119
ipv6 adaptation

752
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,400
is still low according to google

753
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,280
only third of google users have ipv6

754
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,079
assigned a site named ynoipv6.com

755
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,480
shows that less than half of alexa top

756
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,920
1000 sites

757
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,280
supported dv6 and that less than third

758
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,640
of alexa top 1 million

759
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,160
sites support ipv6

760
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,160
i will quote the site author and will

761
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,200
say that

762
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,800
this is a huge change i would like

763
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,800
to personally ask you at the end of this

764
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,160
presentation

765
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,920
to check whether your home network

766
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,440
support ipv6

767
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,880
and if it is actually enabled

768
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,160
cgn adaptation on the other hand is only

769
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,200
growing

770
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,200
and will continue to grow if you won't

771
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,240
switch to ipv6

772
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,160
except the obvious fact that it breaks

773
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,599
the end-to-end principle

774
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,119
there are different other issues in

775
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,560
different aspects since cgn introduced

776
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,480
i will elaborate on those new issues in

777
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,280
the next slides

778
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,280
now you can see how cgn deployment

779
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,160
should look like

780
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,440
in theory

781
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,880
it is meant to be deployed in dual stack

782
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,920
each subscriber has a cgn ipv4 address

783
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,119
and also a public external ipv6 address

784
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,000
enjoying both legacy support for a and

785
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,839
ipv6

786
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,880
sounds good but in reality

787
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,000
cgns are the wild west since we don't

788
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,720
have control

789
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,200
over the sp in that device we don't know

790
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,880
how it is configured

791
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,720
they can do whatever they want without

792
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,439
regulation

793
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,640
apparently some sps give only not ipv4

794
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,359
address

795
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,560
without any option for ipv6

796
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,240
it's a logical solution would be the

797
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,240
opposite

798
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,520
i haven't heard of ipv6 only sp yet

799
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,599
but there are some ipv6 on hosting

800
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,079
services

801
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,760
there are many posts on the internet of

802
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,599
people complaining they have issues with

803
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,160
running some services

804
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,560
most of these people either find out for

805
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,440
the first time

806
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,839
they are behind the cgn and people tell

807
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,599
them to enable ipv6

808
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,480
to solve all their problems small

809
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,200
portion

810
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,839
already knows that they are behind cgn

811
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,200
they also mentioned

812
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,400
that the isp doesn't have ipv6 support

813
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,800
and ask for advice how to overcome this

814
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,520
issue

815
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,839
but i have found this one particular

816
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,640
interesting post

817
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,760
one year ago a user on reddit

818
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,000
asked how cgn deployment impacts the

819
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,040
users

820
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,400
as we saw earlier it does

821
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,440
this user claims he works in isp and

822
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,119
they are currently planning to deploy

823
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,400
cgn without ipv6

824
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,680
this shows that also the cgn rfc clearly

825
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,560
mentioned

826
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,480
the deployment should be dual stack mode

827
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,200
with transition mechanisms to ipv6

828
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,119
this is not necessarily how it is done

829
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,119
in practice

830
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,920
on the other hand myasp does support

831
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,200
doorstep

832
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,839
but you need to explicitly ask for it

833
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,520
they will tell you they don't officially

834
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,720
support it

835
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,280
and the connection with the ipv6 enabled

836
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,480
for some reason

837
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,079
is not optimal and you get better

838
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:17,280
results with a physics disabled

839
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,400
unfortunately some people think that nut

840
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,040
is a security technique

841
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,760
you expose only the ports you need in

842
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,160
the land addresses you want

843
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,200
no no no no not is not a firewall

844
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,960
this is only a by-product from the

845
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,359
workaround for the brokenness of the

846
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,560
end-to-end principle

847
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,920
that nothing produced if you run

848
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,200
legacy os inside the knot ipv6

849
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,359
can open up a doorbox if you don't

850
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:48,800
configure your

851
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,920
gateway firewall correctly

852
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,520
sorry one passion zero can infect a

853
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,319
whole sp

854
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,359
with a worm we might see worms

855
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:03,839
returning big time inside cgi networks

856
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,160
because that breaks the end-to-end

857
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,839
principle some applications stop

858
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,280
working different techniques are

859
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,000
introduced

860
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,680
in order to overcome these issues

861
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,520
upnp is one of those

862
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,040
akamai has published a research in 2018

863
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,920
about a campaign that exposes mb ports

864
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,640
on machines

865
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,119
behind the nut to exploit the eternal

866
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,359
blue vulnerability

867
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,480
a subscriber inside the cgn can do the

868
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,079
same

869
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,000
except it won't expose the ports to the

870
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,760
public internet

871
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,160
he will expose them to the cgn private

872
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,880
ipv4 outdoor space

873
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,280
this kind of attacks are also called

874
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,160
hole punching attacks

875
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,319
cgn deployments might be vulnerable to

876
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,839
similar attacks

877
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,720
and with double punching the sports it

878
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,319
might be possible to expose those

879
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:00,960
machines

880
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:08,240
to the public internet adventure

881
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,800
as i mentioned cgn was supposed to be

882
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,160
deployed with dual stack

883
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,920
to enable smooth transition to ipv6

884
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,480
in practice cgn is deployed without any

885
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,440
regulation

886
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,560
and sometimes without ipv6

887
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,119
instead of adopting the real solution we

888
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,160
give life support

889
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,560
to ipv4 although it was doomed a long

890
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,040
time ago

891
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,520
on top of that we add new internet

892
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,880
connected devices

893
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,240
every day iot smart watches

894
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,079
even cars some of these new devices

895
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,440
most likely don't even support ipv6

896
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,000
ask yourself do you really want your car

897
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
to be connected to a pb4cgn

898
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,480
if you're not sure about your answer to

899
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,680
my previous question

900
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:04,079
take a look at this

901
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,079
europol already identified legal

902
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,440
problems with cgn

903
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,119
in 2017. before cgm

904
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,680
everything was simple if a security

905
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,520
agency would give an ip address and a

906
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,160
date

907
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,520
to the isp the asp would provide records

908
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,200
of the subscriber and their internet

909
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,359
activity

910
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,560
with cgn multiple subscribers share the

911
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,240
same ip

912
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,720
does the sp records or what's happening

913
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,118
inside the cgn if there is no regulation

914
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,680
the quick answer is no

915
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,280
here are some examples the europol gate

916
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,800
for cases being closed

917
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,800
because of missing records for cgn

918
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,359
activity

919
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,200
in one case with partial records 49

920
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,440
innocent people were questioned

921
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,920
the privacy was violated because of one

922
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,720
criminal

923
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,640
to share the same ip address with them

924
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,119
on cgn

925
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:05,440
what would happen if the cgn ip was

926
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,839
shared by 1 000 subscribers

927
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,800
would 999 people will be questioned

928
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,400
without doing anything if you think

929
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,119
about it

930
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,760
cyber criminal doesn't need a vpn he

931
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,040
just needs a cgn

932
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,000
to cover his tracks if he can combine

933
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,560
both

934
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,599
he can be bulletproof

935
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,000
as we saw in the previous slide your

936
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,560
privacy can be violated indirectly

937
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,200
because of the actions of a subscriber

938
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,640
sharing the same external p

939
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,480
address with other innocent subscribers

940
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,720
but your privacy can also be violated

941
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,760
directly by another subscriber

942
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,839
because all the subscribers are inside

943
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,359
the huge line

944
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,920
what stop someone from doing a port scan

945
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,839
and perform reconnaissance on other

946
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,839
subscribers

947
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,480
in some cases it is even possible to

948
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,480
determine the approximate geolocation of

949
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,520
another subscriber

950
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,119
as mentioned much earlier the end-to-end

951
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,960
principle is broken

952
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,920
the cgn is a black box controlled by the

953
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,119
sp

954
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:16,560
but what do they do actually with our

955
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,640
packets

956
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,040
and finally for the conspiracy lovers

957
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,880
here's one for you

958
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,920
what if the nsa had backdoors in the cgn

959
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,559
equipment

960
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:31,040
to spawn on people think about it

961
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,480
the following text is taken from a

962
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,599
research

963
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,880
that was done in 2016. it says

964
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,559
there isn't sufficient guidelines and

965
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,040
regulations on cgn deployments

966
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,160
and call it a black art which leaves a

967
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:46,960
subscriber

968
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,119
with no other choice rather than to

969
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,880
believe that his isp

970
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,839
knows how to do it

971
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,440
now we approach the juicy part security

972
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,520
issues

973
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,079
some cgn equipment ships with default

974
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,760
passwords

975
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,280
that's the companies that sell these

976
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,440
devices do proper security checks for

977
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,240
these devices

978
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,040
as mentioned other subscribers can

979
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,119
actively or passively hack us

980
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,000
because we are on the same line actively

981
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,839
by port scanning and exposing some

982
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,359
vulnerability

983
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,799
or positively by a war

984
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,960
black hackers would want to gather a

985
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:31,760
foothold

986
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,119
inside the cgn those networks must

987
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:35,839
contain

988
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,960
easy targets some network

989
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,800
might be even full of specific

990
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,319
vulnerable devices

991
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,960
that are given by the sp to all of the

992
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,319
subscribers

993
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:49,839
massive jackpots

994
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,040
services that use ap address as

995
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:53,920
additional

996
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,079
security measure can be easily bypassed

997
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,400
if a hacker managed to get credentials

998
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,000
to such servers

999
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,400
and the credentials belong to a cgn

1000
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,839
resident

1001
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,839
the hacker simply needs to be connected

1002
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,200
to the same cgn

1003
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,599
as a resident and easily bypasses

1004
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,200
additional security check

1005
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,200
because both will have the same external

1006
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,839
ap address

1007
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,880
in theory to cause the ddos to cgn

1008
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,240
from outside of cgn should be easy

1009
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,800
with some effort it might be possible

1010
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,720
from inside as well

1011
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,480
you simply need to overload the nut

1012
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,280
table with open sessions

1013
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,400
myasp resets the subscriber connection

1014
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,599
each day at midnight probably to flash

1015
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,319
all the open sessions

1016
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,280
the ddos impact in both scenarios is

1017
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,359
ddos for all the cgn subscribers

1018
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,920
as they can't initiate new connections

1019
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,200
because the nut table is full

1020
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,079
from gluten perspective blocking a cgn

1021
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:58,800
ip

1022
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,559
will lead to a massive user block

1023
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,400
because of the actions of a single

1024
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,960
offender

1025
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,240
i mentioned default passwords on cgn

1026
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,000
devices i didn't make this

1027
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,240
up

1028
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,800
this is an a10 device exposed to the

1029
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,839
public internet

1030
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,720
we default password this is only the

1031
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,000
load balancer

1032
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,079
but this might happen with cgi equipment

1033
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,160
as well

1034
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,400
this device is ranked like that for over

1035
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,319
a year

1036
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,559
this might be still a huge problem as an

1037
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,240
issue with the load balancer

1038
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,160
most likely will affect the subscribers

1039
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,558
as well

1040
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,000
okay now let's see some real life

1041
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,240
examples of what actually happens inside

1042
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,799
the cgm

1043
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,359
we can see the same subscriber receives

1044
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,119
a different cjnip address

1045
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,079
and is connected to different gateways

1046
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:00,960
this happens

1047
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,920
each time he reconnects once again the

1048
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,720
legal issue

1049
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,040
comes to mind does it speed up

1050
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,960
everything or it's just random

1051
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,440
assignment

1052
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,200
the same thing happens with ipv6 a

1053
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,440
dynamic appear location is made

1054
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,520
once more the issue of logging user

1055
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,640
activity is being questioned

1056
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,359
most likely ipv6 logging is insufficient

1057
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:26,000
at the sp

1058
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,520
level and needs to be regulated

1059
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,119
as i mentioned a subscriber can scan the

1060
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,680
cgn subscribers

1061
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,559
but he also can scan the cgn equipment

1062
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,160
to potentially hack it

1063
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,200
there is no network oscillation

1064
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,520
this is a potential that only cgn

1065
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,960
resident have

1066
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,040
as those devices are not accessible

1067
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,440
directly from the public ipv4 space

1068
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,000
you might think how bad this can be

1069
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,760
obviously there will be devices with

1070
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,119
different passwords and security

1071
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,720
vulnerabilities

1072
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,880
but this can happen on public ipv4 as

1073
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,880
well

1074
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:11,119
however cgn exposes some old risks

1075
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:13,040
probably because someone thought that

1076
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,520
nat is a security technique

1077
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,280
we can find externally open file shares

1078
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,960
it's like we're back to the early days

1079
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,319
of this millennium

1080
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,559
when computers were connected directly

1081
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:25,680
without nut

1082
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,800
with the file shells exposed

1083
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,240
today if a hacker will find such a

1084
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,079
he will most likely leverage into some

1085
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,200
sort of ransomware attack

1086
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,680
now we can see an interesting case i

1087
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,400
will call it

1088
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,520
a voodoo we see a printer that has

1089
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,119
internal landmarking

1090
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,240
an external ipv6 address as well

1091
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,720
but it is also somehow exposed to the

1092
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,839
private ipv4 space of the cgn

1093
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,319
although this ap is not listed anywhere

1094
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,880
on this page

1095
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,079
this is most likely due to some sort of

1096
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,280
sort of misconfiguration but you can

1097
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:07,599
find

1098
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:12,480
similar cases in cgn networks in high

1099
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:14,880
numbers

1100
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,599
at this point i hope you understand that

1101
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,839
cgn can be problematic

1102
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:23,839
but the solution is actually very simple

1103
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,839
upgrade to ipv6 restore entwine

1104
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:28,640
principle

1105
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,880
upgrade to ipv6 solved by pv4 exhaustion

1106
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,720
upgrade to ipv6 solve crime attribution

1107
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,280
upgrade to ipv6 install full control

1108
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,440
over your network

1109
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,000
great pb6 experience the full power of

1110
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,520
the internet

1111
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,559
upgrade to ipv6 it's 2021 it's time to

1112
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:49,839
upgrade

1113
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:53,119
and yes i wrote upgrade to ipv6 six

1114
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:53,680
times

1115
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,119
on purpose

1116
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,359
okay we have learned that you all use

1117
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:00,319
cgn

1118
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:04,160
in one way or another unfortunately

1119
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,920
some of the cgn deployments are broken

1120
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,119
cgn is basically the insider threat

1121
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,559
for residential networks

1122
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,960
due to coffee 19 many people work from

1123
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,079
home

1124
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:25,280
some of you might have a cjn at home

1125
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,599
as i showed earlier there are security

1126
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,680
issues with cgn

1127
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,119
this should be considered as an

1128
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,119
additional risk factor to working from

1129
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,280
home

1130
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,920
there is no real benefit from cgn to a

1131
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,119
subscriber

1132
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,160
maybe to the asp but remember

1133
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,200
ccgm is not a permanent solution it was

1134
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,000
intended

1135
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,640
as to be a transitional technology until

1136
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,119
we fully switch to ipv6

1137
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,480
so let's embrace the tv6

1138
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:59,839
uh thank you for your time and

1139
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,359
you're welcome to ask question work

1140
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:03,680
adventure or find me on twitter

1141
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,839
hope you enjoyed my talk thank you

1142
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,359
wow um thank you it was very interesting

1143
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:14,799
to hear about the

1144
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:18,000
wild west of cgn and

1145
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,319
for instance how criminals may just hide

1146
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,160
in the crowd

1147
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,040
uh again i'd really like to thank you

1148
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,240
although you paint a bleak picture

1149
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,480
um to all of you listening there will be

1150
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,559
i'd like to remind you about the q a

1151
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:35,520
immediately

1152
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,960
following this presentation

1153
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:43,680
uh in work adventure and

1154
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,480
we also have some extra time now because

1155
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,400
we have a 15 minute break

1156
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,040
until a quarter after so i guess 20

1157
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,319
minutes

1158
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,960
um i'd like here to invite you all to

1159
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,599
join us

1160
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,400
in session one for the featured panel

1161
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,400
life and security practitioners

1162
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,599
in the wild will with uh nazir

1163
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,799
