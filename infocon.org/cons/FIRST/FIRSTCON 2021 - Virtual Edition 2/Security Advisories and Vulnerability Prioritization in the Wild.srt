1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,040
welcome on our talk

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,960
about our research into security

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,720
advisories and vulnerability

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,680
privatization

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,719
in the wild which is a research we

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:11,759
conducted

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,639
for national cyber security center for

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,880
the netherlands and ccnl

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,840
and we are stephanie the smaller and

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,000
great van dyke were both researchers at

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,720
ncc and we conducted this research in

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,840
collaboration with

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,119
michelle van eter from delft university

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,720
of technology

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,520
so over this research we looked into

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,520
what happens when organizations

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,520
receive information about possible

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,879
vulnerabilities

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,480
and given that these organizations have

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,879
a finite capacity to conduct security

21
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,399
updates

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,640
we asked how do they prioritize the vast

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,440
amount

24
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,200
of vulnerability information and

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,640
advisories which is published every day

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,920
to start at the yearly

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,719
number of cves we see a strong increase

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,480
every year

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,280
as a graph shows here from cve details

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,319
we started

31
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,960
with around

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,040
more than four thousand in 2010 and 10

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,000
years later

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,600
we see there are almost nineteen

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,840
thousand uh cves published

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,880
every year every year which isn't

37
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,600
um even the total amount of

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,880
vulnerabilities

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,920
found in hardware and software every

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,200
year

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,240
but this indicates the growing stream of

42
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,439
information and the

43
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,640
growing need for organizations asserts

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,360
to analyze and assess and communicate

45
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,119
about these vulnerabilities which takes

46
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,560
a growing

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,920
capacity for organizations and

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,960
ourselves so

49
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,560
our main question was how do

50
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,399
organizations process vulnerability

51
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,040
information

52
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,240
and prioritize vulnerabilities to start

53
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:54,720
off

54
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,399
one of the tasks of the ncc is to inform

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,759
our target groups on

56
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,680
current vulnerabilities and

57
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,560
analyze and assess them and communicate

58
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,679
our assessments

59
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,200
to them we do that in the form of

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,480
security advisories

61
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,239
so the ncc now has a risk score

62
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,000
matrix not not unlike the cvs escort

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,560
to assess the vulnerability on basis of

64
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,680
one likelihood

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,120
and be possible damage and

66
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,480
we published this these security

67
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,560
advisories about recent vulnerabilities

68
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,080
or threats in specific

69
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,760
software or hardware we publish around

70
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,640
a thousand security advisors each year

71
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,319
and here you see as well the steady

72
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,200
increase

73
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,040
from 2012 when there was 650

74
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,120
published so um here's you see the

75
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,920
growth

76
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,720
in security advisories and the

77
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,680
information

78
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,959
we uh put out each year

79
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,400
and approximately every year hour in

80
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,840
2020

81
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,000
approximately 40 advisories

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,400
are categorized as high high these are

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,280
relatable to

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,959
critical advisories critical

85
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,680
vulnerabilities and

86
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,920
we communicate these both through our

87
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,440
security advisories and also

88
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,120
through calls indicating that they're

89
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,280
both they receive special attention from

90
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,640
both

91
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,120
us as wealth or as well as of our target

92
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,159
audiences so looking at the

93
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,400
vulnerability management field

94
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,319
we see that early research has found

95
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,440
that users do not

96
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,879
interpret it to see these escort

97
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,959
consistently and that the formula

98
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,959
has been used not always just is

99
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,159
sufficiently justified

100
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,840
or validated um adding to that is that

101
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,879
prescriptive prescriptive models

102
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,159
that exist for organizations to organize

103
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,000
vulnerability management and capacity

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,560
for

105
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,200
for example suns or gardner do not

106
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,000
always have

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,519
a much empirical grounding

108
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,879
moreover they present a clear-cut

109
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,000
path from immature to a mature posture

110
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,080
for vulnerability management based on

111
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,200
the use of tools

112
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,478
thresholds and policies while

113
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,680
these current maturity models assume

114
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,000
a perfect capacity and a perfect

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
information position

116
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,479
of these organizations which is not

117
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,720
always the case

118
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,560
as seen by research from

119
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,360
frankly is that decisions are mostly

120
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
influenced by organizational factors and

121
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,400
processes

122
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,720
for example as he has shown us that the

123
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,120
staggered deployment of updates

124
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,960
implicitly trades on security for

125
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,840
reliability

126
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,360
so for our research we did 22

127
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,720
semi-structured interviews

128
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,080
our goal or our population

129
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,720
target population was the constitution's

130
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,240
constituencies

131
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,280
of ncc now which is a mix

132
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,560
of small and large organizations mix of

133
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,080
central government organizations

134
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,000
critical infrastructure and the common

135
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,960
denominators

136
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,639
all these respondents receive ncc

137
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,759
security advisories

138
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,840
so looking at the organization's size of

139
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,400
our respondents

140
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,240
we interviewed both very large

141
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,520
organizations with more than

142
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,960
10 000 employees smaller ones with

143
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,759
less than 50 employees and you see also

144
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,800
that there is a large diversity between

145
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,039
the size of the instant respawn teams or

146
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:41,840
teams

147
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,280
some some are very small some have

148
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,360
multiple instant response incident

149
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,120
response teams

150
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,759
interestingly is that the size of the

151
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,120
organization not all

152
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,520
always correlates one-on-one with the

153
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,440
size of the incident response team

154
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,520
so when we talk about large organization

155
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,560
in this context

156
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,960
we don't necessarily mean the total size

157
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,240
of employees but we mean

158
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,759
that these organizations have either a

159
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,919
large security team or a large incident

160
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,280
response team

161
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,520
and we see a lot of small organizations

162
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,479
with a big it

163
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,840
focus a more complex it

164
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,520
infrastructure and a larger security

165
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,160
team than

166
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,120
large organizations with a less i.t

167
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
focused

168
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,759
organization

169
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,680
who were the recipients of affordability

170
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,440
information that we interviewed

171
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,680
the largest group we interviewed were

172
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,800
security analysts

173
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,080
followed by csos

174
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,400
and interestingly is that some of the

175
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,919
small organizations we interviewed

176
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,080
is that they combine both the role

177
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,360
security officer

178
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,240
and system admin which means that these

179
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,919
organizations have

180
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,080
people that both look at the inflow of

181
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,680
organizations and assessment

182
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,120
but also are responsible for the

183
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,199
remediation of

184
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,120
these vulnerabilities whereas large

185
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,120
organizations with for example

186
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,120
security operations centers have

187
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,880
dedicated analysts

188
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,800
who only analyze and assess the

189
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,560
information then pass it on

190
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,840
through to the people responsible for

191
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,280
remediations my colleague will talk a

192
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,479
little bit more about

193
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,599
our research into that

194
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,880
so one more interview topics

195
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,800
we looked at the inflow of security

196
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,560
advisories and other forms of

197
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,120
vulnerability information we looked at

198
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,080
how this information

199
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,319
is processed by organizations how they

200
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,360
assess the information

201
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,000
and how to prioritize the received

202
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,639
information

203
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,440
and vulnerabilities we also looked at

204
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,360
the remediation process

205
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,120
of vulnerabilities so now my colleague

206
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,919
stephanie will dive into our research

207
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,919
results

208
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,680
okay so i will take it from here and

209
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,639
provide more details about the results

210
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,319
of our study

211
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,280
uh so back to the main question how do

212
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,960
organizations

213
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,240
uh process and prioritize vulnerability

214
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,440
information

215
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,400
we've created a simplified workflow as

216
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,080
you see here and this is

217
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,120
by no means a management model so what

218
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,800
we intended to do is

219
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,240
look at how vulnerability

220
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,360
information is processed in practice so

221
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,160
in real

222
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,800
life in organizations because

223
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,080
there is no perfect information uh

224
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,159
there's limited capacity so how do

225
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,839
organizations deal with these

226
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,760
uh limitations so what are the coping

227
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,320
mechanism

228
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,760
mechanisms and bringing back

229
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,200
the uh the workflow into

230
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,080
four categories so the inflow how

231
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,240
information is received

232
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,160
where it is received who see who

233
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,680
receives the information has

234
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,640
looked upon uh how is the information

235
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,279
assessed

236
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,160
and by whom uh what is the uh house

237
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,519
urgency and relevance

238
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,160
of a specific uh vulnerability

239
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,480
determined

240
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,600
then how is a potential uh

241
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,279
vulnerability remediated how is it

242
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,680
prioritized and

243
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,839
mitigated and the last

244
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,320
step uh how is a vulnerability

245
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,360
media remediated vulnerability evaluated

246
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:29,839
and

247
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,920
is feedback provided if a reporting

248
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,560
process

249
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,760
is in place

250
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,600
so what are the key observations

251
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,040
of of the study we will go

252
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,600
into detail in the next slide so i will

253
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,640
dissect them

254
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,959
one by one but the key observations are

255
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,800
that the majority of respondents

256
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,920
learn about vulnerabilities

257
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,279
reactively whilst a minority

258
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,519
proactively searches for vulnerabilities

259
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,560
and i will go back into these uh

260
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,079
remarks in more detail in the next

261
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,800
slides the second the formalization of

262
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,440
vulnerability assessment depends on the

263
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,200
triage capacity of the organization

264
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,240
third the security advisories sent by

265
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,560
authorities aid in creating urgency and

266
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,640
necessity for mitigation

267
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,279
and lastly vulnerability reporting

268
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,279
depends on organization

269
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,120
uh the organization of uh

270
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,160
triage and the specific type of

271
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,320
vulnerability

272
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,760
now looking uh diving into the first key

273
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,560
observation

274
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,880
reactive learning versus proactive

275
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,480
searching we found that the mailbox

276
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,959
unsurprisingly is a central note for the

277
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:51,600
inflow

278
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,040
of vulnerability information

279
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,279
it is where individuals receive

280
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,440
newsletters and also secure security

281
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,800
advisories about

282
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,279
uh vulnerabilities also but also mail

283
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,160
from vendors

284
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,880
about specific um relevant

285
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,240
vulnerabilities but it's

286
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,720
it's also a form of a reactive

287
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,519
a reactive form of receiving information

288
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,200
and the majority of these for all

289
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,079
organizations

290
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,120
the the mailbox was the central node

291
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,120
another form of

292
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,000
how individuals reactively learn about

293
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,600
vulnerabilities is that

294
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,880
the majority of respondents relied on

295
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,959
trusted third parties to provide

296
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,839
information on relevant vulnerabilities

297
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:46,640
and this is one

298
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,680
form of a coping mechanism where

299
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,120
if there is limited capacity to to

300
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,160
look for vulnerabilities to to make

301
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,560
sense of the high

302
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,720
of the amount of vulnerabilities then

303
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,760
organizations

304
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,880
tend to rely on those organizations that

305
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,560
provide that filtering

306
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,639
process for uh them

307
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,040
is is one of them but others uh

308
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,079
specifically

309
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,600
uh the example used here i see assert

310
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,800
if uh or uh organizations

311
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,000
with ot security tend to rely on third

312
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,680
parties such as ics

313
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,000
cert to filter relevant vulnerabilities

314
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,480
for them so

315
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,680
and if we look at sources used by

316
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,880
organizations to look for

317
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,320
vulnerabilities then we see that

318
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,000
vendors are

319
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,399
our source used most frequently and

320
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,480
what i forgot to mention here is that

321
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,600
ncsc is

322
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,240
left out in this graph but it's it's a

323
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,040
given that ncsc is the source used

324
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,279
because all the uh we all the

325
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,079
respondents

326
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,120
already receive security advisories by

327
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,040
the ncc that's why we left it out in the

328
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,920
graph

329
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,800
other sources often used are security

330
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,720
websites so a variety of

331
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,200
of national and international websites

332
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,920
are

333
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,519
used but also vulnerability scanners

334
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,880
and so what we see is that

335
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,440
as opposed to other sources which are

336
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,320
more based on the personal interest of

337
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,040
specific

338
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,320
uh security analysts there are um

339
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,160
scanners have a special place in that

340
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,760
that they're more of a proactive form of

341
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,839
seeking out vulnerability information

342
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,519
which brings us to the the last

343
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,240
point is that specifically medium to

344
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,399
large organizations are more inclined to

345
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,800
use

346
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,920
vulnerability scanners to actively

347
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,760
search for vulnerabilities

348
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,920
and are regarded as an important source

349
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,079
in asking respondents the question which

350
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,560
type of information is most important

351
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,440
for you

352
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,079
then we see that scanners are as

353
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:18,800
important

354
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,320
as information received

355
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,839
by trusted third parties and

356
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,160
such as the national cyber security

357
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,279
center

358
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,079
or vendors

359
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,800
going into the second category

360
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,760
assessment

361
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,800
we see that the risk assessment in

362
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,240
security advisories

363
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,399
plays an important role in the

364
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,760
prioritization and assessment

365
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,480
of the organization and particularly

366
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
this is not exclusively for small

367
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,240
organizations but it is a coping

368
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,839
mechanism that

369
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,880
um uh

370
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,360
that smaller organizations tend to rely

371
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,880
more on

372
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,839
the risk assessment done by um

373
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,720
authorities

374
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,760
and vendors because they don't often

375
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,880
have the capacity

376
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,240
to to do all the assessments themselves

377
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,040
and secondly the small organizations

378
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,120
the assessment is done by the receiver

379
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,199
of information

380
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,720
uh and also

381
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,800
the remediation is done by the receiver

382
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,399
of the information and that's because

383
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,440
many of the respondents have had a dual

384
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,279
role so they were both

385
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,360
system admin and a security officer

386
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,639
so it would make sense that

387
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,000
this individual runs through the entire

388
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,680
process workflow of uh from the inflow

389
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,600
to the assessment to the remediation as

390
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,639
opposed to

391
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,880
large organizations which have different

392
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,040
roles different teams for each part of

393
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,639
the workflow

394
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,079
uh and there you see that

395
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,440
the the rules are much more

396
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,480
spread out and far apart from each other

397
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,000
and lastly the received

398
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,920
information is checked against public

399
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,360
social sources

400
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,959
and here we see a difference

401
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,240
in again between smaller and larger

402
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,040
organizations

403
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,160
that larger organizations have automated

404
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,360
and formalized these

405
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,680
checks checks on third parties and again

406
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,839
this is a capacity issue

407
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,399
um if you have a large incident response

408
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:44,880
team

409
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,399
and if you have a

410
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,759
devops capacity in your in your team

411
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,360
then it's much more easy to automate

412
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,199
these things than if you have

413
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,959
if you are operating solo which

414
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,079
makes it uh harder

415
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,639
to to proactively

416
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,500
formalize these uh

417
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,549
[Music]

418
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,640
these checks

419
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,199
going into third category security

420
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,799
advisories

421
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,959
uh uh what we saw

422
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,000
organizations uh appoint roles or teams

423
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,919
to track and lead remediation

424
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,640
processes effectively and this here

425
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,720
there's a difference between

426
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,960
organizations that have highly

427
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,720
formalized processes

428
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,760
and organizations that have more um

429
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,919
ad hoc processes so we saw on one hand

430
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,160
organization with formalized processes

431
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,360
have

432
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,399
will have

433
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,480
a crisis manual which say

434
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,039
in event of this and this vulnerability

435
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,000
will scale up

436
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,640
and we have this specific team as

437
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,600
opposed to

438
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
an ad hoc organization that much more

439
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,360
takes a case-by-case

440
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,120
view and looks at the specific

441
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,960
vulnerability and then

442
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,280
assembles a team

443
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,320
and a second point is that security

444
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,200
advisories

445
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,200
are used um as by the majority of resist

446
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,320
recipients to advocate um

447
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,640
mitigating measures and there was this

448
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,919
was an interesting find

449
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,679
that advisories sent by the ncsc

450
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,080
had a higher author have authority in

451
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,039
higher management

452
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,400
actually actually uh were used as a

453
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,559
measure for persuading management to

454
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,879
to mitigate specific vulnerabilities

455
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,039
and lastly what we saw here

456
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,840
in in the remediation process that

457
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,600
internal socks

458
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,760
were much more involved in the whole

459
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,200
process than external

460
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,400
so what we saw is that

461
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
if you look at the whole cycle from

462
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,919
inflow to assessment

463
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,200
to remediation to reporting external

464
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,799
socks were only were very active in the

465
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:15,360
inflow

466
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,280
and sending information to the

467
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,960
organizations but

468
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,120
not much involved in the whole

469
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,080
assessment and

470
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,480
remediation processes as opposed to

471
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,080
internal socks

472
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,640
who took a more active stance were part

473
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,919
of the

474
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,360
crisis structure and involved in

475
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,840
also the remediation and reporting

476
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,320
process

477
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,960
so lastly if we look at the reporting

478
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,440
phase

479
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,919
this was highly dependent on the type of

480
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:44,799
organization

481
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,640
however in in

482
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,799
in case of a critical vulnerability the

483
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,080
reporting phase became

484
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,559
particular became important in all

485
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,160
organizations so

486
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,600
uh all organizations wanted to know

487
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,960
what were the measures uh when was it uh

488
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,240
when when was it patched and is the

489
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,799
vulnerability remediated yes or no

490
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,799
and here there's a difference between

491
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,000
ad-hoc

492
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,039
organizations who have

493
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,840
where reporting is less of a structured

494
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,799
less structural and for highly

495
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,559
formalized organizations which have

496
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,280
a reporting phase built into their whole

497
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,760
cycle

498
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,200
secondly uh here we saw yeah smaller

499
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,400
organizations

500
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,720
have less formalized reporting processes

501
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,799
this makes sense because

502
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,280
uh as i mentioned earlier as

503
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,159
particularly

504
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,919
those that have individuals

505
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,760
which have a dual role um

506
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,760
have um less

507
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,640
less use of a reporting process because

508
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:00,960
the

509
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,840
the groups are so small

510
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,320
and uh what we

511
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,320
what we saw in uh an interesting

512
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,720
way to formalize these processes is that

513
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,000
ticketing systems play

514
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,200
a central role in reporting and tracking

515
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,240
the vulnerability to the ash process

516
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,400
because they can be they can be

517
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,080
assigned and tracked and

518
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,280
around the ticketing system uh a process

519
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,000
is

520
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,880
is formalized

521
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,919
so what are the key takeaways from these

522
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,159
these insights is that organizations

523
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,159
have coping mechanisms to process

524
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,799
vulnerability information

525
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,240
think for instance of

526
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,880
about using trusted third parties to

527
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,480
filter information

528
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,440
secondly risk assessments of trusted

529
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,400
third parties

530
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,120
uh kickstarts uh own vulnerability

531
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,039
triage processes

532
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,159
uh what we saw particularly

533
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,880
relevant here is the risk assessment

534
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,799
done by the ncsc which you

535
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,720
which was used in this third security

536
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,960
advisory sent by authorities aid in

537
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,400
creating

538
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,520
urgency and necessity for mitigation

539
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,320
so using advisories

540
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,000
for higher management and lastly the

541
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,240
reporting evaluation phase particu

542
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,840
is particularly relevant for critical

543
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,320
vulnerabilities

544
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,520
and here we see a uh

545
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,240
difference between organizations which

546
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,720
have

547
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,200
uh adult processes and organizations

548
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,919
which

549
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,400
have highly formalized processes in how

550
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
important this reporting and evaluation

551
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:52,880
phase

552
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,480
is so here are

553
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,840
some of the works that we cited and

554
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,039
this was our presentation and this was a

555
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,360
pilot study and we're looking to

556
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,159
collaborate

557
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,240
to conduct a comparative study

558
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,159
affordability triage and other

559
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,799
search so if you are interested please

560
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:13,440
contact

561
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,280
us you can email us at research at

562
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,760
ncsc.inl

563
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,919
and we're we're starting we've just

564
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,840
started up this research so if you're

565
