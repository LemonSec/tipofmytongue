1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,160
hi everyone i'm mark from tx1 networks

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,480
today we are honored to have opportunity

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,320
to share with you about our

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,280
hunt for major league iot ics list a

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,880
deep diving to iot street

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,200
ring in this talk we will share in

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,880
detail how we build

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,439
automatically large-scale hunting system

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,400
and give a

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,519
deep look into the overall situation as

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,080
well as

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,279
chance we observe it over the past years

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,160
and longest with

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,880
six example to demonstrate low strength

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,920
trends

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,160
and we will share the benefit from our

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,320
research as well as the response

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,040
to study we find and finally the next

19
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,399
step

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,239
for our third hunting system project

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,800
and who is this one just want to join

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,960
the eventual company by trimecrimosa and

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,879
we focus on providing cyber defense and

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,960
visibility for opportunity knowledge

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,920
and currently i'm a 3 researcher for tx1

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,640
networks

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,440
i'm focusing on iot ics and scada

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,120
security research

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,840
and also i have um ensure many um

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,520
research security research

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,920
at a major league security conference

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,040
such as hikongs

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,799
tour hacking the box braha and others

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,080
and i i'm also the general coordinator

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,960
of hacks in england taiwan conference

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,400
like he come 201 and practically my

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:24,960
college

38
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,040
and he's our indeed engineer

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,520
and today's online is basically divided

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,960
into three parts

41
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,079
first we will describe why we want to do

42
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,799
to build an automatic hunting system and

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,000
what benefits for

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,280
it and second we will um

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,479
enter today's focus the enemy

46
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,119
of um our hunting systems it will not

47
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,240
easy to build a

48
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,040
automatic hunting system and english

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,840
part we will fully share the fundamental

50
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,399
of

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,439
its constraint construction in this

52
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,960
third part we will share

53
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,280
how we use the elite system by sharing

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,119
six hunting sample

55
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,959
of discoverings um from our hunting

56
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,599
trip hunting and finally and based on

57
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,720
our observations

58
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,920
we will outline the next step steps

59
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,120
for the future of our iiot hunting

60
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,800
systems

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,239
the first one and so why we

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,480
why did we decide to create a domestic

63
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,080
surrounding systems

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,720
and first we noticed a little increasing

65
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,760
of iot street and ddos attack

66
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,840
and as well as the red represent iot

67
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,760
bonnet and male wage

68
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,560
and back and back we started i'm going

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,239
to have just predicted

70
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,400
last 25 percent of attacks in 2020

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,160
are related to iot and also

72
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,840
also predictably the size of iot market

73
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,120
and there will be 75 billion

74
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,640
iot devices by 2025 and also

75
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,959
um we know the manual hunting is no

76
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,159
longer possible

77
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,599
on such a large scale so looking at all

78
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,640
this

79
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,920
developer automatically hunting season

80
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,640
things like

81
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,840
opposite are obviously a next step

82
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,959
so so many devices

83
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,000
and one on the benefit of automatically

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,040
hunting

85
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,440
and offers one automatic detection and

86
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,040
real-time blocking

87
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,239
of various threats and

88
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,519
located various threat trends

89
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,920
quickly and threatened analysts can

90
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,879
quickly focus on specific threats

91
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,120
and the cost of human maintenance is

92
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,480
extremely low

93
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,480
so we will show conceptually later of

94
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,360
this part later

95
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,400
and next let's take a look our three

96
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,239
hunting systems

97
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,879
and to clear clearly i'm sure how we

98
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,760
created

99
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,480
the architecture of our iot ics hunter

100
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,680
hunting systems

101
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,799
we use the data flow as a starting point

102
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,280
and our hunting engines are responsible

103
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,519
for interacting with the attack

104
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,640
recoating all the traffic received and

105
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,840
then send it to the hunting

106
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,880
and how the agent may mainly aggregate

107
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,839
aggregate the traffic captured by

108
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,560
multiple

109
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,000
engines with the militia file divided

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,160
land into the mailways or suspicious

111
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,759
fire and kpcap after ensuring their

112
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,880
integrity is in in unity of hours and

113
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,520
log

114
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,520
logs are transferred to the hunting

115
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,440
student cloud

116
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,639
and in steps too the cloud surprise plus

117
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,000
across and

118
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,759
main way and keep peak heavy before

119
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,479
uploading land to aws s3

120
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,080
and in step three we focus on analyze

121
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,120
peak tab and mainly content

122
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,880
as in its past past on the session close

123
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,520
again

124
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,800
and get the url and cnc service

125
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,600
and the mailway closer executed on

126
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,639
hunting

127
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,280
agent hourly and in step four

128
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,639
process mainly produced on a list

129
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,759
of male malicious ips and urls

130
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,320
and which is used to generate generate a

131
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,120
black list

132
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,639
and show a visual map of attacks

133
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,639
and actually list before and simplify to

134
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,960
drunk at the same time

135
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,919
they are showing and separated here to

136
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,120
collect

137
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,160
clearly and simple to say this step

138
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,240
is response for no one unknown

139
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,800
compassion of a male way

140
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,080
so step one to step five uh o hourly

141
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,960
automatic

142
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,280
process in other words a little process

143
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,880
basically do not need a human

144
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,639
interaction

145
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,560
and to wrongly

146
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,960
and from stem states streamless conduct

147
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,560
manual analysis of

148
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,639
various stress and land producer

149
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,520
corresponding to their intelligence

150
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,479
another step seven it is based on our

151
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,680
implementation of hunting

152
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,960
engines against various ammunities

153
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,680
some vulnerabilities it required us to

154
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,479
modify our

155
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,199
hunting engine and at this time we will

156
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,479
create a new amy

157
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,680
image and use some one-click deployment

158
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,880
and to to make sure our new r of

159
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,360
new engines is new list and we will show

160
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,479
a video demo

161
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,400
this later and we have

162
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,840
deployed more than 350 hunting engines

163
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,880
globally but

164
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,800
how does one decide and deploy hunting

165
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,360
engines so

166
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,759
when hack discover our engine the first

167
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,120
things they will do

168
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,080
is try to send attack traffic to our

169
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,680
hunting engines

170
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,759
and because we want to hunt the various

171
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,280
protocol banks attacks

172
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,479
through hunting engines we develop

173
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,880
and implement multiple iot ot server

174
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,319
hunting engines

175
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,319
traffic handler help us to assign

176
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,160
specific protocol panel to

177
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,800
correct hunting engines and after

178
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,479
interaction is complete

179
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,560
the hunting handler will get the attack

180
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,960
speed load from multiple hunting engines

181
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,840
the handler will use the mailway hunting

182
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,560
engine

183
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,160
to collect a mailway or other malicious

184
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,880
file

185
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,599
from the attacks pillow and finally

186
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,080
handle uploadless parallels and mailways

187
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,440
to hank agent

188
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,639
for data transforming here is the

189
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,440
process of

190
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,479
uploading the text payload and manage

191
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,800
and from hunting engines to the hunting

192
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,840
systems

193
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,720
and here is handler before uploading

194
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
attack payloads and male weight lagging

195
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,879
assistant hunting season the

196
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,919
handle transformer lower

197
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,319
agent and we are building some cures for

198
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,759
the hunting agent

199
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,479
they are firewall and some spirit tool

200
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,120
and to avoid a hunting system being

201
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,800
broken by ddos

202
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,919
attacks the fire is responsible to god

203
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,240
and monitor the assisted history of

204
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,599
hungary agent

205
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,919
and the firework the imminent keep

206
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,919
external attacks away from

207
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,720
hunting system and to avoid

208
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,879
large payload to impact performance out

209
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,400
of hunting systems

210
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,080
spiritual is a response to divided the

211
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,160
original parallel into multiple sections

212
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,360
like little figure

213
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,559
and a low balancer will help us to

214
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,399
kind of collect the section which brings

215
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,860
to to to do it

216
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,080
[Music]

217
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,039
well for hello's files are uploaded to

218
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,159
the s3

219
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,200
london will trigger and to perform with

220
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,279
small weather session closer procedures

221
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,160
and through deploying the malware and

222
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,399
session curves to ecs the hunting system

223
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,000
can handle larger data from

224
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,560
our hunting agent and each has allowed

225
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,200
us

226
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,480
to overcome a limited comp competition

227
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,480
results the memory crosser detected the

228
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,959
connection status of the cnc server and

229
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,399
download the sample

230
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,640
from the server it will always end live

231
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,680
streams

232
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,240
with the newest material and information

233
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,160
from cnc server

234
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,839
and the section cursor is responsible

235
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,720
for passing the content of pcapp

236
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,240
and whether it's attempt to find a

237
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,320
specific command injection urls and

238
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,440
anything else

239
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,200
that may be um considerably constrained

240
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,240
and after hunting system analyze the

241
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,040
pcap

242
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,320
and mail weight it list

243
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,120
of malicious ips ui laws at the last

244
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,920
night it will

245
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
also trigger longer to conduct a more

246
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,600
in-depth block list

247
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,040
production process and we will compare

248
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,680
it with a various stress to ensure that

249
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,600
our blacklist is able to block

250
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,120
real tackle body members the hunting

251
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,240
system will create

252
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,800
internal service to confirm if each ip

253
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,519
belongs to

254
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,720
the sheer ip or not if life belongs to

255
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,399
public or shared ip

256
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,320
naming the attack is hiding behind the

257
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,079
ip this ip

258
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,959
and the honesty will filter this ip to

259
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,880
avoid the ipv being instead into the

260
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,399
blacklist

261
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,600
in the end of the process we will update

262
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,160
the

263
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,399
final block list to s3 and to interface

264
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,040
with

265
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,000
related production surveys at the same

266
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,800
time we will

267
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,519
visualize the earth's attack on our

268
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,160
global

269
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,839
threat analyst

270
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,720
and our malware analyzer will create

271
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,560
every single data mail way

272
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,040
basically we compare the status of

273
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,720
mailway with virustotal

274
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
and varsolo can let us know how many

275
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,079
totally new

276
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,720
mailways we get from our hunting agent

277
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,120
at

278
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,000
each hour and such as automatic process

279
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,839
effectively reduce mail

280
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,680
investigation and analytics time spent

281
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,279
by our internal researchers

282
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,680
so let's show online mail ways or

283
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,600
receive every day

284
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,880
and after analysis on an integration

285
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,160
of related relevant information the

286
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,880
complete

287
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,120
information will be sent back to s3 as

288
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,040
signal for subsequent analysis

289
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,000
and also the analysis were more deep

290
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,720
automatic

291
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,959
on the content based on our signal like

292
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,240
they want to hunt to

293
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,480
analyze securely fine to facilitate

294
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,560
facilitate a timeless of enemies

295
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,320
so for example every day we monitor

296
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,160
international information secure

297
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,120
excellent

298
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,279
and the status of molenbeet notification

299
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,399
and released

300
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,560
we will conduct the predictor analysis

301
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,440
of

302
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,880
illustrate and determine whether or not

303
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,079
we need to update of our

304
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,959
engineer long war to ensure that we are

305
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:55,760
capable

306
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,920
we are capable to of detailing low

307
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,240
strength

308
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,639
and let's stop of um whole process this

309
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,720
is function set up to strengthen length

310
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,399
of our automatic process in responsible

311
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,360
to

312
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,639
constantly update it also is we often

313
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,360
need to deploy new hunting agents image

314
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,600
onto our hunting system so in order in

315
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,760
order to make list it clear

316
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,880
clean example we

317
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,279
have prepared one click deported light

318
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,000
on timeless

319
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,800
time video to for display and the video

320
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,720
stopped from one click deployment and

321
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,040
run step one to simplify automatically

322
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,440
so here's our one click deployment

323
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,120
automatic sample

324
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
and you already know the whole process

325
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
of our hanging 600 and

326
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,399
so the 100 engines and we will deploy

327
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,040
the new

328
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,800
10 uh hunting engines in the cloud

329
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,760
our hunting system ignore uh hunting

330
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,880
engine here

331
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,079
and use our one click and just save the

332
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,399
pro

333
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,240
call and deploy the

334
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,360
our hunting system engines so we stay up

335
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,760
10

336
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,240
instance so you will set you will see

337
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,040
here

338
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,160
we create a 10 instance

339
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,720
and an instance created and we'll

340
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,839
trigger

341
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,880
our every service and

342
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,040
so you will see the old instance is

343
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,240
running

344
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,360
now new new instance and

345
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,760
every data well well um integrate to our

346
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,480
agent so in our hunger agent welcome

347
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,040
lake uh

348
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,560
collect every data from the hunting

349
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,680
engines so the

350
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,279
data they have is very very big and big

351
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,079
size

352
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,720
and we need to load it and about one to

353
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,920
two hours process

354
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,480
in step one step one to step five that

355
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,120
will step

356
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,320
spend one to two hours to

357
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,199
to handle this

358
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,680
so here i'm just we just show and we'll

359
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,440
trigger to a little answer

360
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,720
and our our devices and um to trigger

361
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,079
load service

362
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,680
and to analyze the main weight and

363
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,000
section browser and here it's locally

364
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,040
installed

365
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,079
you see um every session and every and

366
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:18,880
main way

367
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,199
i'm closer we handle this english part

368
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,600
and this part is it's very in so many

369
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,040
data and

370
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,120
i'm sorry for need to because we need to

371
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,600
uh protect our internal surveys so

372
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,240
we should some we have some masks in

373
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,560
this video

374
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
so you will see so many a lot and we

375
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,440
will build a lot and to do like internal

376
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,120
analyzing in english part

377
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,160
so we we complete many many data

378
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,440
and and to analyze every by hourly to

379
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,240
analyze list

380
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,519
and at least already it's 10 laps video

381
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,240
so the whole process from this video

382
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,680
we instagram maybe one to two hours

383
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,599
so so we'll get the result

384
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,480
so here okay great and and then we will

385
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,079
build the um

386
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,279
the hourly data hourly data on

387
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,480
unboxings data here and also this

388
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,720
this data will trigger all the service

389
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,800
all the services to do uh analyze

390
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,560
and store the data and store the data

391
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,839
so you will see everything here

392
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,040
the hourly that's how we got

393
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,360
and we set up the stat we treated our um

394
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,680
back-end cervix because of the spam

395
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,800
survey is is by our loading every hours

396
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,720
because we know every hour is loading

397
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,639
every hour's traffic attack payload is

398
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,000
not different

399
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
it's different and the site is also

400
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,279
different so we will

401
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,240
by loading to trigger list service

402
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,160
so i also do too many many

403
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,440
here so and you will see after that

404
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,880
you will see this totally data

405
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,000
storage code file beta and the black

406
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,480
list here the ip address

407
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,079
and why we we think it is malicious

408
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,279
also we are well deported here and also

409
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:39,839
we can use

410
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,440
our signa to curl every data and we get

411
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,320
and here we lock the block block hat and

412
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,160
then for the sensor because we need

413
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,000
black hat sensor

414
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,480
and you will see the new top new 10 cent

415
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,759
instance sensor

416
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,519
on the engines and the data will show

417
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,040
here

418
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,920
so we use this monitor with this

419
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,399
magnesium to monitor the

420
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,319
thread around the world and also 75 we

421
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,160
will do a malware analyst

422
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,880
analyze and we will gather the main way

423
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,319
to store the s3

424
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,039
and also when when deployed to the s3 as

425
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,959
well trigger london and other services

426
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,480
to scan the mailway sample

427
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,640
and download our internal surveys on

428
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,439
download our own sound malicious file

429
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,480
and triggerland and wrongly on some

430
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,280
difference

431
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,559
and also after analyze it and

432
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,039
typically we'll say compare with the

433
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,799
virus total

434
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,840
you will see some and information

435
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,280
and if you're so long or little it means

436
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,200
um the wristlet cannot detect it and

437
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,280
also we will receive the

438
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,840
undefiled sharing and we will quickly to

439
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,039
do handle legs

440
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,840
we want to make sure our service is

441
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,400
newest

442
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,919
and we can detect every mailway attack

443
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,919
so here we want to highlight our

444
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,120
iot and isis 3 hunting system and our

445
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,360
hunting engine can hunt more than

446
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,039
30 protocols across iot and ics

447
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,320
and for dynamic adjustment the system

448
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,640
can automatically dynamically

449
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,280
adjust the system process based on the

450
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,720
hourly traffic size

451
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,679
and we don't need to discrete dedicate a

452
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,039
lot of power

453
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,160
for machine to do data processing

454
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,960
at least effectively um cut down low

455
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,240
cost

456
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,400
and also in deep analysis allowed us to

457
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
provide extremely

458
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,760
um uh practical and deep information

459
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,640
about cyberseries and one click

460
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,520
deployment

461
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,799
and we wish you already you know

462
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,280
just one click then you can delete and

463
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,640
finally we have um

464
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,600
classified a larger number of parallel

465
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,640
as soon as

466
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,360
um as classification magnesium and the

467
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,400
pair laws

468
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,919
of the same type of attack are

469
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,400
aggregated together to help us identify

470
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,280
no and well known

471
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,320
attack situation in a short height

472
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,840
and due to the timing constraints

473
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,240
we will not explain more about parallel

474
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,200
classification

475
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,480
at least height also um

476
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,320
cost rate um cost um reduction

477
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,720
uh radiation allowed us to continue to

478
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,760
improve the research we want to do

479
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,000
and then after introduce our hunting

480
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,960
seasons

481
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,559
let's quickly see the sex hunting

482
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,720
example to see what this intelligence

483
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,320
can do

484
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,039
first i will see hunting as a service

485
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,440
and from september 2019 to low

486
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,160
first week of october 2020 we analyzed

487
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,080
the 20 plus tv date out of three

488
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,080
of traffic and in fact we count

489
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,480
um all the way back to the beginning of

490
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,360
2019

491
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,679
our um analysis where is 6 um 45 tb data

492
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,640
and which also due to the postural

493
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,600
modulation

494
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,200
of our architecture and attack situation

495
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,720
and however we are major measures unless

496
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,640
from september yeah and from lost 20 db

497
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,600
data

498
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,400
and traffic and we are detected over 1.

499
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,840
billion attacks

500
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,919
from over 200 countries and um

501
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,120
we hung over from 70 million distinct

502
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,640
malicious ip

503
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,600
and 50 millions and distinct suspicious

504
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,080
demands

505
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,240
land after individual analysis of the

506
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,200
hunting system

507
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,919
we successfully blocked 37 plus million

508
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,520
malicious ips

509
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,880
and 2.1 plus of malicious

510
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,000
domains and find 1.4 police

511
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,960
plus malicious possible bonding devices

512
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,440
and 2.6 plus

513
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,840
a malicious piece of mailway

514
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,360
and also on an average about 3 millions

515
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,080
attack

516
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,600
are the 10 per day and more than 170

517
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,159
thousands malicious ip are detectable

518
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,960
date and we block more than 93 000

519
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,000
malicious ipp

520
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,720
every day so we believe we will provide

521
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,480
a good service

522
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,000
and useful and quickly and second and

523
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,240
global bond analysis is an alert and

524
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,799
this is a trend of bonnet

525
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,400
um measured by date and our definition

526
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,039
is

527
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,760
when attack was one to separate or in

528
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,679
fact

529
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:34,400
extremely and we define it as a part of

530
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,080
of a barnette it can be seen here unless

531
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,039
parallel

532
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,200
are trying to download speech script or

533
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,960
mail away from other

534
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,000
source is various forms so trying to

535
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,720
carry out

536
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,080
various policies or

537
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,760
control and behavior

538
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,240
and use real case we provide customer

539
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,240
straight a lot to public

540
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,159
for example when we detected some

541
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,159
attacks from taiwan government service

542
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:02,799
network

543
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,280
we preferred analyses and provide a

544
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,120
feedback to customers who had

545
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,640
reached out our um for

546
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,960
our for emergency um response

547
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,600
also here are some basics um and it's

548
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,360
like top 10 countries with

549
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,400
the most devices of onboardness or top

550
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,679
10 um attack source country

551
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,840
attacked countries here i'm just for

552
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,960
reference

553
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,120
and third one is um unknown mainly

554
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,240
playground

555
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,080
and here is we saw the total number of

556
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,919
unknown pieces of male weighted

557
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,799
um hunter per day on average we hunted

558
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,600
more than

559
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,720
1200 piece of mail waste in a day

560
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,640
and however from january to april 2020

561
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,480
the number of an hour mail weight was

562
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,760
much smaller

563
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,760
and we guess that at least may be

564
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,600
related to your global calling lighting

565
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,000
situation

566
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,520
but but if we look at the unknown

567
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,480
malware ratio

568
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,360
um every day we will find out the

569
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,159
difference

570
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,240
is not that big um which is lined

571
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,640
um with the overall trend with seeds

572
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,960
and also you will find that the number

573
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,799
of um normal ways

574
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,000
in the front of is is very scary but

575
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,720
after removing duplicate and leaving

576
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,400
only elf

577
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,440
um there will be about um eighteen

578
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,480
thousand um unique known male ways and

579
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,760
frankly speaking

580
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,880
this number is still very large but

581
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,640
in terms of architecture i3 86

582
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,440
on or maps and still a kind of about

583
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,679
build

584
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,880
of course and we also um conduct simple

585
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,000
automatic analysis

586
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,200
on normal way we find um

587
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,440
or manual analysis and sometimes you

588
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,440
will find a lot of interesting things

589
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,120
and fruit um let's take a look at one

590
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,320
day on normal way

591
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,360
i'm sorry i'm a monumental hunting um

592
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,520
we've lost so many vulnerabilities and

593
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,960
so many cv numbers

594
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,400
and how it do we know on the status of

595
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,679
one day

596
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,880
or um vulnerabilities and we will create

597
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,640
a signature and for various

598
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,520
vulnerabilities

599
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,960
and observes whether there is any change

600
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,240
in the change

601
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,640
so for example here's a chart showing an

602
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,960
increasing trend of wearable remote file

603
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,159
exploration

604
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,960
so here's the password and we'll

605
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,000
broadcap

606
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,720
and it's well known ability um to use

607
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,640
one and three years ago

608
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,880
and broken sure very high trend at the

609
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,159
end of um

610
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,960
2019 and it's decreased uh at the

611
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,600
beginning of

612
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,279
2020. and however for unknown attacker

613
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,320
vulnerability

614
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,320
or mobility we regularly classify

615
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,240
various parallels and automatically

616
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,679
send our mail and so let's three

617
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,320
analysts can quickly determine whether

618
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,158
they are a new attack or not

619
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,279
an attack chain ls is a early warning

620
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,320
system

621
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,360
let's let this send you um for different

622
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,080
protocols such as q show or telnet

623
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,840
or http so i'm such a string graphic

624
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,520
helps us quickly classify

625
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,159
and when we find later that amount of

626
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,120
attacks

627
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,480
on a particular protocol increasing

628
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,600
we can quickly coverage and conduct and

629
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,600
conduct active investigations

630
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,039
and regarding the next generation of

631
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,400
trades we have also

632
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,520
obsessed increasing chance of detection

633
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,080
or attack traffic against the ics and

634
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,360
scala protocols like

635
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,400
using ip siemens s7 mitsubishi

636
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,200
device 6 or amlong things and our

637
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,640
detachment handling

638
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,760
includes hunting based on the content of

639
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,840
the protocol for example the whale shark

640
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,120
screen and

641
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,440
on the right side is part of our hunt

642
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,279
it's a real motorbike protocol

643
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,360
and a tank one to use and that they're

644
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,360
using

645
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,880
and finally what are the next steps

646
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,320
for next generation iot hanging systems

647
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,320
so mostly focusing on iot and ics rates

648
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,159
and recording observation about

649
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,799
operations we expect to bring

650
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,159
the conflict indus we know 4.0

651
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,600
environment into

652
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,480
our hunting systems and of course stray

653
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,760
development

654
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,880
will never stop so for the short term we

655
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,640
plan to import

656
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,080
um azure access and scaling device and

657
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,799
system into our hunting engine and using

658
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,679
related

659
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,159
techniques to enable our hunting engines

660
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,840
around the world to interface

661
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,120
interface with real equipment

662
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,840
and in the long term the real devices is

663
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,000
sometimes difficult to maintain

664
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,039
so we expect to use a virtualized

665
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,039
virtualized high interaction hunting

666
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,200
engine in the future

667
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,559
so here we will share the video

668
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,559
of a high interaction on the engine

669
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,760
sample we built

670
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,240
another one was here and in this video

671
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,520
and you will see here on the first one

672
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,720
is a kang part and but it didn't meet

673
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,640
our need because it's very low

674
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,760
interaction

675
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,760
and the right side will suffer some

676
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,120
error and compile

677
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,000
seven can respond to scan from a map but

678
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,360
cannot conduct deep

679
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,399
interaction but our uncustomized honey

680
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,919
engine can do everything

681
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,120
and we provide highly interactive

682
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,520
interactive only engines that meet some

683
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,039
we need

684
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,880
and it's easy to integrate to our

685
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,039
hunting system

686
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,799
so you can use a map you can interact

687
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,720
with our ps memory

688
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,320
you can control the poc it's very easy

689
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,480
and also and what is the next step of

690
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,000
nature next generation

691
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,200
on my iot hunting systems i will believe

692
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,159
um the hunting system io honey engine

693
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,200
will roughly

694
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,399
uh fully coverage the scope of iot

695
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,600
and for traffic and malaysia's

696
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,320
main wave analysis we will in deep study

697
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,120
to

698
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,080
uh different applications like machine

699
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,080
learning traffic analysis or malware

700
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,279
analysis

701
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,559
yeah we will do to try to do those as an

702
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,279
automatic

703
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:34,080
analysis so we target and most of our

704
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,200
hunting more

705
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,720
precise and let's watch things closely

706
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,440
remarked

707
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,480
and about this talk uh i just really

708
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,320
want to highlight some parties

709
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,520
automatic 300 system is excellent tool

710
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,520
for some larger iot devices attacks

711
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,320
in the world and continuous expense

712
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:54,960
expansion

713
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,559
or of iot and iot threats and we also

714
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,360
take a 600 example

715
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,760
into a small part of the resource

716
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,600
available in the hunting systems we

717
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,000
believe

718
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,640
because there is still more treasure

719
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,360
waiting for us to discover

720
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,880
and the next generation of straight

721
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,880
ielts trading is coming

722
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,200
and early preparations is is the way to

723
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,240
deal with

724
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,840
it we believe we need it and then we

725
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,679
we we believe this is very high

726
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,440
valuables

727
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,000
