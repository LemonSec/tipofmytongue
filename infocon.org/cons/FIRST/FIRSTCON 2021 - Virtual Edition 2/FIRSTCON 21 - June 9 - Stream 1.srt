thank you thank you hello everyone

59
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,440
today our topic is on wearable ecosystem

60
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:29,920
and

61
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,239
bluetooth attacking the bluetooth low

62
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,000
low energy design and implementation on

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,440
mobile phones let's get started

64
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,519
uh before that quick introduction about

65
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,560
us uh

66
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,640
i am sunil working as principal security

67
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,160
analyst and d partner

68
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,800
before this i was in hola security team

69
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,480
and rsm technology

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,640
uh today i have uh with me nathan

71
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,400
lakshmanan he is also a principal

72
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,040
security analyst in the partner

73
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,040
uh before this he was in august networks

74
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,040
and ads and technology

75
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,720
regarding deep armor it's a security

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,560
consulting firm we do penetration

77
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,319
testing vulnerability assessments for

78
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,200
our client

79
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,519
and we also provide various security

80
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,720
trainings to

81
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,519
organizations

82
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,440
today's agenda is first we will explain

83
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,120
about the iot ecosystem

84
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,280
then we talk about challenging uh

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,200
challenges faced in securing these never

86
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,480
before gadgets

87
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,040
uh then we talk about bluetooth and ble

88
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,080
security

89
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,080
uh and nitin will be showing some cool

90
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,000
demos on how to synthetic

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,799
traffic and how to use drop on the data

92
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:33,440
finally

93
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,519
we conclude our presentation with

94
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,720
proposal

95
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,560
on securing these kind of gadgets

96
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,280
yeah this is how a iot ecosystem looks

97
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,760
like

98
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,400
it has mainly four components mobile

99
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,040
phones

100
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,720
cloud hardware devices and the protocols

101
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,760
let's take an example of home automation

102
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,920
in an home automation system there will

103
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,040
be

104
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,959
devices called as nodes which will be

105
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,560
having sensors will be

106
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,799
deployed across the house and this will

107
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,080
be collecting information

108
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,560
like uh temperature fire alarms home

109
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,640
security alarms and more

110
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,640
at regular intervals this node will be

111
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,080
sending information

112
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,560
to the gateway to the low power uh

113
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,358
consuming protocols like zigbee z-wave

114
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,479
gateway being the device which

115
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,960
computes the larger part it sends this

116
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,479
sensor information to the

117
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,560
backend services which will be deployed

118
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,560
on the cloud

119
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,639
this cloud can be private of public

120
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,880
cloud we know that well-known public

121
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,919
clouds like

122
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,960
amazon gcp and azure

123
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,199
user of the home automation can use the

124
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,160
mobile application

125
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,479
that you see on the right side to see

126
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,680
the um

127
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,560
or monitor the house at any given point

128
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
and this mobile phones can also be used

129
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,320
to configure the gateway through

130
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,759
bluetooth ble or wi-fi direct

131
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,880
some iot ecosystem these

132
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,360
mobile phones can be eliminated where

133
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,240
the

134
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,080
larger part of computations will be done

135
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,680
on the gateway

136
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,759
one more interesting factor is there can

137
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,080
be multiple nodes and multiple gateways

138
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,240
across the system it is not restricted

139
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,440
to one gateway or

140
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,520
one node based on the requirement of the

141
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,359
products these can be multiplied

142
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,199
yeah let's take and let's take a case

143
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,600
study of linear fitness coach

144
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,080
this is a head-on device which is mainly

145
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,120
used

146
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,600
for the athletics to the athletes to

147
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,400
improve their

148
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,800
athletics activities it can be owned

149
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,240
during the running it can be owned

150
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,080
during the cycling and it does a lot

151
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,320
more by taking instructions it's

152
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,560
available so it should be comfortable

153
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,080
and you should be smart enough to take

154
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,400
the user commands and respond back

155
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,560
and it should also be untethered because

156
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,560
most users like to

157
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,639
use their gadgets with wire dangling

158
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,759
around them

159
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,440
and it should have a feature like

160
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,199
continuous learning to

161
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,680
uh to see the activities of user and

162
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,400
provide

163
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
inputs based on the activities done by

164
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,520
the user

165
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,840
overall it should improve the quality of

166
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,720
life of a

167
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,919
user and one more interesting thing is

168
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,000
users like to see their activities in

169
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,759
pictorial representation

170
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,440
and not just in the plain text

171
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,120
there are quite challenges uh in

172
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,319
securing these kind of

173
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,960
gadgets because our traditional splc

174
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,880
frameworks are mainly applied for

175
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,280
uh products which are which run for long

176
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,639
time and with a constant

177
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,199
requirement but whereas in these type of

178
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,360
gadgets time to it to market will be

179
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,160
very less

180
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,639
and the requirements can be continuously

181
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,400
evolving

182
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,120
and when we see protocols for these kind

183
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,639
of gadgets you will be ending up with

184
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,479
around 30 to 40 different low power

185
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,160
consuming protocols

186
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,960
so choosing a proper protocol for your

187
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,080
product will be

188
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,360
one more difficult job and when we

189
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,039
choose a proper protocol

190
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,120
adoption of this protocol for that for

191
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,720
your device will be one more

192
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,000
big factor so we have a demo on this

193
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,720
on how a weak adoption of protocol can

194
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,440
lead to

195
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,479
uh data waste dropping another

196
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,360
uh a few factors are longitudinal iot

197
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,160
products

198
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,120
and privacy and there are there is a

199
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,919
there is not

200
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,479
much research on this iot security

201
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,120
section also

202
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,680
uh there are a few technical challenges

203
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,479
as well

204
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,199
uh as we know that these variables will

205
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,440
be collecting lot of information

206
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,319
like geolocation of user biometric data

207
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,360
sensor data

208
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,599
and even some wearable devices will

209
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,360
accept the payment as well

210
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,759
so securing these kind of gadgets is

211
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,879
merged

212
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,960
so these gadgets will be running with

213
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,479
limited software stack they will be

214
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,960
running

215
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,960
firmware with less kilobytes so

216
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,879
so implementing security features on

217
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,400
these type of device

218
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,479
will be little difficult and quite

219
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,759
challenging also

220
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,639
security requirements like dpl man uh

221
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,479
key exchange process pressure execution

222
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,680
environments are

223
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,800
a little bit challenging and along with

224
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,560
the hardware device we need to protect

225
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,360
our cloud

226
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,039
and the mobile applications as well

227
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,720
yeah let's jump into the ble part uh

228
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,639
this really is a subset of

229
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,639
bluetooth it will be used for short

230
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,919
range data exchange

231
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,360
thing it operates um

232
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,560
it operates at frequency 2.4 to 2.485

233
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,440
gigahertz

234
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,599
and its range varies from 10 to 600

235
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,719
meters

236
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,039
this bluetooth well is maintained and

237
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,080
organized

238
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,839
governed by the bluetooth sig group

239
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,120
the recent version of bluetooth is 5.0

240
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,399
uh we know that this bluetooth uh widely

241
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,040
used in

242
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,680
various sectors like wearable devices

243
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,720
healthcare systems

244
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,839
earphones and more

245
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,560
coming to the clearing mechanism there

246
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,800
are mainly four pairing mechanism

247
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,680
uh this secure simple pro pairing is

248
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,480
introduced

249
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,279
uh from bluetooth version 2.1 this

250
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,480
mainly uh

251
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,399
simplifies the pairing mechanism of

252
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,160
bluetooth device

253
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,240
as i told there are four mechanisms one

254
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,080
is just work where there is no user

255
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,600
interface and there will be no user

256
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,640
authentication

257
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,440
the temporary key will be all six zeros

258
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,279
whereas in the numeric comparison

259
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,399
there will be a button and a display a

260
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,279
user should

261
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,279
press f or not seeing the pin on the

262
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,560
display

263
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,760
the third one is pass key entry where

264
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,399
the

265
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,120
device will be having a display and a

266
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,360
keypad to enter the

267
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,560
pin the last one is out of band uh

268
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,959
signal

269
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,920
the user authentication will be done

270
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,760
based uh through the another protocols

271
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,000
like

272
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,320
nfc or wi-fi direct to exchange the

273
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,440
primary

274
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,480
temporary key after exchanging this

275
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,200
temporary keys and ending up with the

276
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,320
long-term key

277
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,839
the traffic will be encrypted using aes

278
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,160
128

279
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,959
algorithm the more about key will be

280
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:07,680
explained

281
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,279
in the later part of the presentation

282
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,480
there are few weaknesses in the

283
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,920
bluetooth or ble

284
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,240
protocol uh the security of the

285
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,000
communication mainly depends upon the

286
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,399
pairing algorithm that we just saw

287
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,200
uh just works as i said the temporary

288
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,760
key will be

289
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,959
triple zero triple zero so it is uh

290
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,200
mainly prone to a man in the middle kind

291
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,320
of attack

292
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,920
and if somebody sniffs all the packets

293
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,600
related to pairing they can extract the

294
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,640
or exfiltrate the long term key we have

295
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,160
a demo for this and we will be showing

296
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,959
that

297
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,920
and finally uh apps on the phone this is

298
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,279
one interesting part

299
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,519
that there are chances that malware

300
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,959
applications on the phone can

301
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,360
sniff your ble data i'm adding it to

302
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,160
it to nathan you'll be showing demos and

303
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,360
explaining the vulnerability

304
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,079
thank you sunit hello everyone so

305
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,320
for as soon i'll explain we are going to

306
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,279
get into a few

307
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,560
demos we have recorded demos with us

308
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,120
uh and you can see that these are the

309
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,480
two devices which are

310
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,279
in talk now uh for the demos so first

311
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,480
one the golden

312
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,360
colored one is the fossil fue dreamer

313
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,480
developed by intel

314
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,560
and second one is a popular fitness

315
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,680
tracker device

316
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,760
and these are fitness tracker device and

317
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,959
they give you

318
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,760
notifications calculate your steps

319
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,720
calories

320
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,760
and give the inputs to the mobile

321
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,800
devices

322
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,360
and we have discovered these problems in

323
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,680
the ecosys in this bluetooth ecosystem

324
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:45,920
and

325
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,160
we have responsibly disclosed these

326
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,040
vulnerabilities

327
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,959
so these are the tools which we are

328
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,800
going to use the first one is the uber

329
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,680
tooth one

330
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,880
which is a open source bluetooth

331
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,040
bluetooth tool and it is used for pen

332
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,560
testing and all other snipping

333
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,399
activities it is developed by

334
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,360
great squat gadgets and it works on the

335
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,160
2.4 gigahertz frequency and

336
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,320
the second one is wireshark as you many

337
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,920
of the people know it is a network

338
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,600
packet analyzing tool

339
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,279
and we are going to use another tool

340
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,279
called crackle which is developed by my

341
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:19,920
crayon

342
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,240
we will be seeing about this in the

343
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,360
later slides

344
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,639
so this is how the setup looks like so

345
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,519
we have the ubertooth one connected to

346
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,079
the

347
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,839
system which is displayed there on the

348
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,160
left side so that is the ubertooth1

349
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,399
and it is going to sniff the traffic

350
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,360
between

351
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,399
the mobile device and the devices

352
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,320
the smart devices wearable devices

353
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,959
so this is what we are expected

354
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,320
expectation is that

355
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,360
when this uh device fitness tracker

356
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,279
communicates with the mobile phone

357
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,680
we will be able to capture the activity

358
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,800
data like a

359
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
step count and calories in an

360
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,120
unencrypted environment

361
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,360
so we will be showing the steps to

362
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,519
capture uh on the other things in the

363
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,279
second part of the

364
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,760
exercise so the first part we have

365
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,120
already captured it

366
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,680
and we are going to display you the

367
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,760
packet captured using wireshark

368
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,079
so this is the this is how the packet

369
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,839
looked like when we captured it

370
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,160
between the device and the phone so you

371
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,200
can see that the

372
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,240
unencrypted ble attributes and other gap

373
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,000
characteristics are visible

374
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,120
in this packets and also you can as

375
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,560
we uh did some research to find the step

376
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,880
count and calories we found the offsets

377
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,120
and you can see at the bottom we have

378
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,040
highlighted these step content calories

379
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,120
which are being transferred from the

380
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,519
from the device to the mobile

381
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,040
so this brings to the concept of ltk

382
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,160
because

383
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,000
you can see that the in this

384
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,519
communication everything was

385
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,160
unencrypted so this brings to ltk which

386
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,279
is long term key

387
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,519
this key will be used for encrypting the

388
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,440
bluetooth communication

389
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,399
so the process is like when the phone

390
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,600
will send a request

391
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
for pairing and the device will respond

392
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,120
with the pairing response

393
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,600
and once it is exchanged there will be a

394
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,880
temporary key exchange

395
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,399
like one of the methods which was

396
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,160
previously explained by sunil

397
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,320
and using this temporary key we will be

398
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,519
generating a

399
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,680
slave random number or master random

400
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,000
number and using these three values

401
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,720
there will be a short-term key developed

402
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,120
so

403
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,519
this short-term key is used for

404
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,399
encrypting

405
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,360
the long-term key so a long-term key

406
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,959
will be generated and it will be

407
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,040
encrypted using the short-term key

408
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,560
and then send between the devices so now

409
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,800
this communication which is happening

410
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,480
between the device and the phone

411
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,360
will be encrypted using ltk that is the

412
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,959
long term view along with this many

413
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,079
other keys like

414
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,839
irk and csrk for identity resolving keys

415
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,320
and this

416
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,839
signature resolving case will be

417
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,720
transferred in this process

418
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,920
so this was how the connection for

419
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,839
agreement for ltk happened so the

420
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,120
pairing request

421
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,560
then the pairing response from the

422
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,279
mobile then establish the

423
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,279
short term key and the encrypt and send

424
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,639
the long term key

425
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,519
once it is agreed the connection will be

426
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,040
the communication between the device and

427
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,079
the phone will be

428
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,560
encrypted so now we are going to see how

429
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,639
it happens

430
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,720
so for this we are going to take the

431
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,160
puzzle queue dreamer

432
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
as previously explained this device has

433
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,959
no display it sends your

434
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,959
calories and step count and other

435
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,240
notifications

436
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,839
so this fossil q dreamer uses the ltk

437
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,000
key to encrypt the communication between

438
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,120
the device and the

439
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,160
phone so

440
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,079
so this is the expectation now so when

441
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,560
we calculate when we capture the

442
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,360
traffic between the device and the phone

443
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,040
we are expected to get the

444
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,600
encrypted step count and calories as

445
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,120
previously we saw in the

446
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,720
previous example we were getting

447
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
unencrypted

448
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,560
step content gallery we will be getting

449
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,440
encrypted packet here

450
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:22,240
so let's jump into the demo

451
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,000
so now what we are going to do is we are

452
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,959
going to start the ubertooth application

453
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,600
and we are going to use wireshark to

454
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,720
display the

455
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,199
captured packets from the ubertooth tool

456
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,040
so we have created a pipe and we are

457
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,320
going to listen

458
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,399
in the uber device so once the ubertooth

459
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,320
device is started you will be able to

460
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,720
see

461
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,000
lots of traffic being generated uh

462
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,759
because there will be lots of bluetooth

463
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,600
devices around you sending discovery

464
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,560
packets and

465
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,000
other packets

466
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,680
so now you can see lots of data is being

467
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,199
already

468
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,240
generator in the traffic and we are

469
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,559
interested in a particular packet which

470
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,000
is the connection packet

471
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,280
so now we are going to pair the possible

472
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,640
device to the phone

473
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,799
and while it is carrying we are going to

474
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,240
capture the

475
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,679
pairing request and response

476
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,679
so we have applied filters for that and

477
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:32,559
we are waiting for the pairing to happen

478
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,120
so once the pairing happens we will be

479
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,480
able to see the

480
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,440
uh l2 cap fragments we are able to see

481
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,880
the l2 cap fragments

482
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,520
and we are also able to see the ll

483
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,360
encryption request ll encryption

484
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,360
response and start encryption

485
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,320
so once this this is where the ltk key

486
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:50,720
is

487
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,280
transferred between the devices and once

488
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,559
it is transferred the entire

489
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,440
communication

490
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,200
is l2 cap fragments so

491
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
previously if you remember in the

492
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,280
screenshot which we showed for the

493
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,919
previous device it was able to display

494
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,200
the att

495
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,960
and other gap characteristics of

496
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,360
bluetooth but we are now having only the

497
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,840
encrypted communication

498
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,320
so does this mean that ldk is enough to

499
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,120
secure your

500
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,360
communication like between the devices

501
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,840
and the phone

502
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,200
now so what we can do is there is a tool

503
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,000
called crackle

504
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,640
developed by micriam which exploits this

505
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,200
flaw in ble pairing process and it will

506
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,000
be able to generate the temporary key

507
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,640
and also figure out the short-term key

508
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,919
which leads to the

509
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,640
long-term key so we will run the capture

510
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,280
pcap

511
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,799
the the traffic which we have captured

512
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,640
for this process and will send it to

513
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,840
this crackle

514
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,080
tool

515
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,720
so now we will be saving this packet and

516
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,520
we will be

517
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,240
showing how it can be used against the

518
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:08,840
tackle

519
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,160
tool so we are going to pass this

520
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,039
pcap to the crackle device and you will

521
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,640
be able to see that

522
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,840
crackle has already decoded and it has

523
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
decrypted and it has found the

524
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,600
ltk key as it is using just

525
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,000
just work mechanism like just works like

526
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,320
zero zero zero zero as the temporary key

527
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,000
crackle was able to crack it very

528
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,360
quickly on the first stem

529
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,919
and it was able to generate the ltk key

530
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:36,799
as well

531
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,840
so now it shows that uh having

532
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,520
uh ltk keys no ltk encryption is not

533
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,440
enough and we are able to

534
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,480
simply crack it using a tool and we will

535
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,360
be showing that

536
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,679
same pcap file decrypted in the

537
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,400
wireshark node

538
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,320
once the filter is applied

539
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,760
we will be able to see all the

540
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,240
communication so now you can see that

541
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,280
all the atp and the gap characteristics

542
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,799
and all the offsets which are

543
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,640
transferred between the

544
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,679
phone and the device are being captured

545
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,720
there is no encryption of l2p caps only

546
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,400
there are all other informations which

547
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,679
we are looking for in the packet

548
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,480
so what what had happened now is the

549
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,039
puzzle

550
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,000
device was trying to pair with the uh

551
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,120
mobile phone

552
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,520
and we are able to sniff the traffic

553
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,880
using ubertruth

554
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,360
and we are ended we have ended up with

555
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,799
the encrypted

556
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,440
packets and this encrypted packets when

557
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,159
passed

558
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,320
to the crackle we are able to get the

559
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,919
decrypted packet

560
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,200
so does this mean that crack fossil

561
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,880
is broken is it uh vulnerable to

562
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,840
any attacks before we get the conclusion

563
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,440
we will also see in

564
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,280
another form of vulnerability where how

565
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,960
another ecosystem challenge can

566
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,880
caused the problems in bluetooth

567
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,520
communication

568
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,159
yeah let's look into the another

569
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,840
challenge in the ecosystem

570
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,840
uh for this we will be mainly

571
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,000
concentrating on mobile application

572
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,559
and the device and we will be seeing the

573
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,240
bluetooth and ble traffic here

574
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,400
yeah this is how a communication happens

575
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
between device and phone

576
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,720
you can see there is there is a lot of

577
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,880
data exchanging between these two

578
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,440
uh mobile application sends comments

579
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,640
like firmware updates

580
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,799
change the ble name uh social app

581
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,000
notification

582
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,480
even some some variables are capable of

583
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,080
accessing a call and referring to the

584
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,039
test

585
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,360
whereas from the device to mobile uh it

586
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,200
will be mainly about the activities the

587
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,120
responses to the messages from

588
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,080
application social social uh app

589
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,960
notifications

590
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,159
and so as nathan explained this traffic

591
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:12,640
will be

592
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,400
encrypted or encrypted using the ltk key

593
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,520
so if attackers sniff this traffic you

594
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,799
will be ending up with the

595
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,919
garbage data that is encrypted so

596
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,480
the problem uh really comes when there

597
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,159
is a major application sitting on the

598
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,080
mobile itself

599
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,240
so what happens here is uh when the data

600
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,760
reaches the

601
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,159
bluetooth layer uh bluetooth layer

602
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,320
decrypts the encrypted dna data and

603
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,320
sends it to the application layer

604
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,799
so any app on the application layer with

605
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,919
bluetooth permissions

606
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,320
can access the unencrypted ble data and

607
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,880
snip all the data

608
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,840
in this case it can be otp it can be set

609
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,880
font or it can be

610
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,440
any personal data that exchanges between

611
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,799
these two

612
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,360
for uh the root cause of this problem is

613
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,240
because

614
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,400
in the really uh in the bluetooth spec

615
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,159
itself it is mentioned

616
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,280
any application with bluetooth or to the

617
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,240
admin permission

618
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,159
they can read the bia characteristic

619
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,159
just like the html tab

620
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,120
so in android a malware application

621
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,679
needs

622
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,880
bluetooth or bluetooth admin permission

623
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,120
whereas in the ios a code bluetooth

624
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,360
framework permissions are required

625
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,919
so here you can see the highlighted part

626
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,039
uh it says

627
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,000
in the bluetooth track admin bluetooth

628
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,280
admin permissions

629
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,880
which will be coming with other

630
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,559
capabilities also but

631
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,840
applications should not misuse it to

632
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,240
any other extent so uh now we have seen

633
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,480
atk can be crashed malware application

634
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,400
can read your daily data

635
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,440
does this mean uh puzzle device is

636
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,480
broken

637
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,919
the answer is no because

638
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,120
the files will uses one more extra

639
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,960
extra layer of protection that is

640
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,360
application level encryption

641
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,960
during the initial stages the possible

642
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,640
device and the possible application will

643
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,279
be exchanging application level secret

644
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,840
this secret will be used to encrypt all

645
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,000
the data extending between the device

646
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,440
and application

647
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,320
so if somebody over there can use

648
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,120
cracker and

649
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,279
crack the ldk but they will be ending up

650
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,799
with the encrypted packets

651
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,960
encrypted data through the application

652
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,000
secret

653
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,919
similarly malware application reading

654
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,919
the unencrypted data

655
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,080
unencrypted ble data will also be seeing

656
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,360
the encrypted

657
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,960
data that is done through the

658
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,279
application secret

659
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,480
so the puzzle uh is not broken because

660
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,120
it is using the application level secret

661
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,799
and this is the recommended way to

662
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,919
implement

663
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,400
ble security of bluetooth security and

664
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,440
the wearable devices

665
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,520
so uh the proposal for these kind of

666
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,240
devices is we need to use the tailored

667
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,240
splc procedure that

668
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,640
apps based on the requirements and the

669
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,919
time to hit

670
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,080
time to hit the market for these next

671
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,760
generation devices

672
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,880
and it is also a necessary to use the

673
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,640
shift left policy that is

674
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,919
to bring the security in the early

675
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,400
stages of the product itself

676
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,039
another important thing is we need to

677
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,559
include privacy

678
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,120
in the spfc procedure and also we should

679
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,760
adapt to industry standards like

680
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,200
osnes cwe and more

681
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
and we have seen that when these

682
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,120
different four components are coming

683
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,760
together there will be a lot of new

684
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,400
issues

685
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,520
arising in the ecosystem itself so it is

686
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,360
important to secure the components

687
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,559
individually and

688
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,000

uh i cannot agree more with the

738
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,480
statement in the abstract

739
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,440
you can't protect what you don't know so

740
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,399
uh

741
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,760

you

745
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,919
um my name is frank franson um and

746
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,600
welcome to the session in this session

747
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,480
we uh

748
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,640
eric grindel and missiles will present

749
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,080
on how easy

750
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,480
that attack uh defense crafts analysis

751
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,919
will support shock

752
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,120
c-sort operations and so

753
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,840
this is part of ongoing research uh in a

754
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,120
european project

755
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,760
2020 project as they are called called

756
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,039
socrates

757
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,919
and as you can see in the title of the

758
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,600
socrates name

759
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,879
attack defense crafts is

760
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,720
one of the founding components in there

761
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,600
we started in

762
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,720
september 2019

763
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,600
and uh so we are yeah more than halfway

764
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,159
uh

765
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,600
further we are doing this project with

766
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,520
10 partners and each partner

767
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,840
have a specific role and bring their own

768
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,880
expertise

769
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,120
um particularly relevant are two

770
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,840
partners that are

771
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,559
end users in our con concept and that is

772
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,360
memnonic which is an mssp in norway

773
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,399
and there and then photon fall which is

774
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,279
an uh

775
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,240
yeah an energy supplier in europe a big

776
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:14,880
one

777
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,440
and their security operations center in

778
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,799
poland which provides

779
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,960
the stock services to other business

780
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,399
units for the i.t

781
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,440
environment they will function as as

782
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,960
pilot environments for

783
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,360
for the project um and each of the other

784
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,960
partners bring technology probably you

785
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,039
know zero servers they will bring

786
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,000
um threat intel uh specific for uh for

787
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,880
the platform but

788
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,120
i will show you that a little bit later

789
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,799
but what is it what that we do and why

790
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,320
do we do that

791
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,799
so the why is best expressed with this

792
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,720
anissa threat landscape

793
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,240
statement from 2017 that said cyber

794
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,760
security community is still far

795
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,520
from striking the balance between the

796
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,520
defenders and attackers and

797
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,200
and then the last sentence where you see

798
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,200
the increase in the defense levels and

799
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,080
expenses

800
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,799
cannot successfully reduce the cyber

801
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,399
threat exposure so

802
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,640
so you can even increase the level of

803
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,679
funding um

804
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,440
but we are still having troubles here so

805
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,360
and this is not only caused by the

806
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,519
asymmetry between the defenders and the

807
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,600
attackers where the attackers

808
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,960
only have to succeed once and the

809
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,960
defenders have to always succeed

810
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,159
in protecting everything um but this has

811
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,039
to do with uh

812
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,919
a couple of elements also so so the ict

813
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:28,799
infrastructure is

814
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,279
increasingly complex and changing in

815
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,279
between all these components is making

816
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,200
it complex and if you don't know what

817
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,039
uh what it actually looks like since

818
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,720
it's changing all the time

819
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,640
then it is becoming harder and harder to

820
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,159
actually defend it

821
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,919
you can only defend what you know that

822
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,360
you can defend

823
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,880
um on the other hand we see that there

824
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,480
is an increase in the number of attacks

825
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,240
and the complexity of these attacks

826
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,720
and and that leads to an increase in the

827
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,840
number of events

828
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,039
uh that that the stock has to uh um

829
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,399
yeah get get to work on and uh and not

830
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,120
only the

831
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,799
the things that you can detect on the

832
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,880
log events but also on all the threat

833
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,039
information and vulnerability

834
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,039
information etc so all the

835
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,880
all the relevant information has to be

836
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,200
dealt with and considered in the context

837
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,360
of your own infrastructure

838
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,320
and then we also see that attacks get

839
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,600
more automated

840
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,320
and whereas the response from incident

841
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,440
response teams is typically

842
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,559
human-centered

843
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,080
so um it's actually machine speed versus

844
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,480
uh

845
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,200
human speed which is uh yeah not not the

846
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,080
greatest uh

847
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,600
situation and where in addition to that

848
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,200
you also see that there is a shortage of

849
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,880
skilled cyber security staff that

850
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,600
actually

851
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,159
is capable of doing this incident

852
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,760
response task so

853
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,000
giving this we had and the statement

854
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,919
above we think that there is a need for

855
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,919
change and we need to do

856
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,840
more automation and and support

857
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,760
the stocks and the sea search that that

858
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,000
protect our infrastructure

859
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,279
and so the project objective is develop

860
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,000
and implement

861
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,600
a security automation and decision

862
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,519
support platform that enhances the

863
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,039
effectiveness of the sox c-sort

864
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,960
operation and as you can see from the

865
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,039
picture it's not the intention

866
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,320
that we take the human out of the sock

867
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,360
but we want to add more automation

868
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,360
to enable them to make more informed

869
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,720
decisions

870
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,360
in decisions on what is going on but

871
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,960
also decisions on

872
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,399
what are the options for response

873
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,679
so we identified

874
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,919
five use cases for which we actually

875
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,519
want to

876
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,720
come up with analysis and and the

877
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,640
responses and that is ongoing attacks

878
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,720
so we detect an attack we assess what's

879
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,039
going on what is the threat what is the

880
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,080
impact

881
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,159
what are the ways to contain the

882
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,600
incident and then we

883
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,840
provide that to the uh the success

884
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,880
analysts

885
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,000
and then they can choose to activate

886
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,200
our suggested response um

887
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,559
the same is for new threat intel when we

888
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,359
learn of a new type of attack or a new

889
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,239
way that a particular apt group is doing

890
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,199
their attacks

891
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,280
and we can assess that in the context of

892
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,719
our infrastructure

893
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,079
and determine if we have to take

894
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,679
particular measures to be better

895
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,280
protected against those

896
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,560
threats uh the third use case is when we

897
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,399
discover a vulnerability in our assets

898
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,079
so we run a vulnerability scanner and

899
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,199
some assets our

900
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,639
software is new vulnerabilities in there

901
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,280
we assess what that means for that host

902
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,040
but we can also assess it

903
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,280
what it means for other assets and if

904
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,760
those assets are compromised more easily

905
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,639
due to the bug in some other system and

906
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,399
the same is for use case four and five

907
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,159
which is a system configuration for your

908
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,560
skate four and new systems being added

909
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,879
and each of these are just events that

910
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,599
we automatically want to assess

911
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,119
what that means for the exposure of

912
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,560
certain critical assets in our

913
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,560
infrastructure and if we have to take

914
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,160
certain precautions so there is

915
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,320
a big difference between use case one

916
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,680
and the other use cases

917
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,839
so this is actually an incident response

918
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,760
case we have an active adversary in our

919
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,720
midst and

920
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,520
yeah we you have to be careful how to

921
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,160
actually

922
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,359
go about it so this is a a bit of a

923
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,200
difference than these ones

924
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,200
the other ones are more focused on

925
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,640
increasing the resilience of the

926
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,200
infrastructure before the excel

927
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
adversary comes along and tried to

928
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,759
exploit it

929
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,520
so based on these use cases we

930
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,520
identified capabilities and

931
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,240
those that that were the basis for

932
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,119
building this

933
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,920
socrates component architecture uh we

934
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,520
don't have time to actually go into all

935
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,400
the details

936
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,800
of it but you can see that at the bottom

937
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,440
there's

938
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,280
the typical things like detection here

939
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,119
this is a seam which is

940
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,400
um existing that's why we made it light

941
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,599
blue

942
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,040
but we have several components that

943
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,599
interact or collect data from the

944
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,240
infrastructure we have thread intel up

945
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,119
here and

946
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,400
shadow server is up here collecting

947
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,079
malicious data and and then um analyzing

948
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:14,640
it and

949
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,040
providing that as threat intel and on

950
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,079
the top row

951
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,839
uh we have analysis tools and in the

952
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,680
middle you see is an orchestration

953
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,960
integration engine

954
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,920
we use activity that's a workflow tool

955
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,040
to make

956
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,280
the workflow for these for the the use

957
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,960
cases that we have

958
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,359
and uh as an integration engine to

959
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,720
communicate to all these

960
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,760
these tools we use the cortex platform

961
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,160
from

962
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,680
the hive project and that enables us

963
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,800
also to easily

964
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,520
add other tools um because the hive

965
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,720
project has already

966
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,440
provided several interactions uh cortex

967
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,000
analyzers and responders for

968
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,200
for integration in that so that um

969
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,599
is what what um the platform looks like

970
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,520
but in this talk we focus on the

971
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,720
infrastructure modeling

972
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,720
component and on the adg analyzer

973
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,880
and the question is why do we actually

974
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,040
need this then we have to explain a bit

975
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,160
about

976
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,119
what adg analyzer actually is and that

977
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,400
is easily explained by

978
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,560
saying well you have a model of the ict

979
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,320
infrastructure

980
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,960
then you have models of an attack step

981
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
and how the attacker goes about

982
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,599
you place an attacker on the model

983
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,480
probably on a

984
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,400
firewall connected to the internet but

985
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,599
you can also place it

986
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,680
if you know there's an asset compromised

987
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,440
you can place it on that asset and then

988
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,480
see how

989
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,640
he will maybe go further in your

990
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,920
infrastructure

991
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,160
but if you have this done these two

992
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,920
components then you can calculate the

993
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,119
attack path

994
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,359
of the attacker how you can compromise a

995
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,560
particular asset

996
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,720
in your infrastructure and all these

997
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,960
steps eric will present this and also

998
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,240
demonstrate this

999
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,800
but yeah we need a model of our

1000
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,720
infrastructure and that

1001
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,960
infrastructure changes so we need a tool

1002
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,760
that can

1003
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,200
automatically provide this model for

1004
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,680
every time we want to analyze it for a

1005
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,520
new type of event for each of these new

1006
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,640
use cases

1007
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,599
we do analysis based using these type of

1008
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,880
tools

1009
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,280
so we looked around for an

1010
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,720
infrastructure modeling component that

1011
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,880
could provide it in some environments

1012
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,599
that can perform typical enterprise

1013
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,560
ict environment we couldn't find such a

1014
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,320
tool so we

1015
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,760
had to build our own this is kind of

1016
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,160
what

1017
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,760
how it looks like so we have existing

1018
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,280
scanning tools or data sources that can

1019
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,000
be used

1020
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,240
we have adapters to collect that and we

1021
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,598
want to automatically

1022
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,880
scan the infrastructure continuously

1023
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,520
update

1024
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,000
the the data we want to normalize the

1025
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,560
data so that we can understand in

1026
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,240
for these applications what it actually

1027
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,680
means that we don't have different

1028
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,400
languages time dimension is important so

1029
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,680
that we can say what is the

1030
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,520
infrastructure look like now but we can

1031
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,520
also ask the question what did does the

1032
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,320
infrastructure look like a month ago for

1033
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,760
and that can be beneficial for threat

1034
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,119
hunting

1035
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,280
and it has to be multi-organization

1036
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,280
because

1037
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,960
mssps have to also be able to use it so

1038
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,359
the concept of an organization a

1039
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,000
customer

1040
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,920
has to be in there so when we started to

1041
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,079
build this we identified that these

1042
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,280
components

1043
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,760
were actually similar to what memnonic

1044
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,560
has built

1045
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,280
uh or for their egg platform act

1046
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,119
platform is a threat intel platform it's

1047
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,520
open source and we use it also in the

1048
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,000
um socrates platform as a threat intel

1049
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,920
platform and it's

1050
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,040
you can get it at this address i think

1051
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,880
that that

1052
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,200
it has been presented at first in

1053
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,800
previous sessions before so

1054
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,880
it's a existing component um

1055
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,599
we have to change the data model in here

1056
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,040
so that we don't have the thread intel

1057
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,480
so we changed it a bit for

1058
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,240
for our own and the data model that

1059
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,280
is actually used it looks like now this

1060
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,640
so we have a host which is assigned an

1061
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,200
ip address the ip address is a member of

1062
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,920
a network segment

1063
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,760
you have routes you can have viable

1064
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,440
rules assigned if this host is a

1065
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,480
firewall

1066
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,119
and there is software that runs on the

1067
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:21,680
host

1068
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,240
with potentially vulnerabilities and we

1069
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,520
have the cve identifier there

1070
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,440
it has to be extendable in a way so that

1071
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,880
that we can add it and

1072
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,160
one of the things that we are currently

1073
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,160
working on is adding active directory

1074
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,200
with it so we

1075
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,119
had a talk today already but we have to

1076
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,040
extend this model also a bit

1077
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,800
but this helps us also to analyze

1078
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,920
the use of policies and

1079
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,079
net flow data and this is particularly

1080
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,680
for the impact assessment

1081
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,319
relevant from which assets uh have a

1082
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:52,880
community

1083
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,200
relationship with other assets and how

1084
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,720
much traffic do they

1085
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,680
obtain and that can say something a bit

1086
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,160
about

1087
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,880
impact uh there so this is the data

1088
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,839
model that we have

1089
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:08,640
currently and this is how it looks like

1090
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,960
at the moment this is the test network

1091
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,760
so you have network segments here with

1092
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,119
issued ip addresses

1093
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,359
this is the host we don't have to fully

1094
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,200
qualify domain name here but

1095
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,280
the ip address the running software on

1096
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,040
it and the cve

1097
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,880
this is a test network it's very basic

1098
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,880
but

1099
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:35,839
and this is where i hand over to eric

1100
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:48,319
thank you friends stop sharing yeah

1101
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,720
thank you so yeah i'm eric i work for

1102
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,560
for city and i want to talk about

1103
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,760
what we do uh in the adg so the attack

1104
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,359
defense graph analyzer

1105
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,640
in in the socrates project so the main

1106
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,680
purpose behind the adg is to

1107
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,319
perform attack simulations to be able to

1108
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,960
predict how an attacker might

1109
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,920
move through your infrastructure and how

1110
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,640
risks

1111
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,680
might propagate and with this we will

1112
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,800
also

1113
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,000
quantify uh how

1114
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,920
likely it is that these attacks are

1115
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,160
successful and also find the most

1116
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,800
critical attack paths to your to your

1117
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,040
high value assets

1118
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,040
and we can do this in a few different

1119
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,880
types of scenarios so looking at the

1120
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,000
current infrastructure

1121
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,760
and how it looks now and with the

1122
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,359
security configuration

1123
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,800
you have um we can run simulations

1124
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,880
once you make changes to this

1125
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,400
architecture

1126
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,400
and when there are new vulnerabilities

1127
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,079
or when you have added security

1128
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,800
controls for example we can also tailor

1129
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,400
this simulation to

1130
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,640
new threat intelligence so how the

1131
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,800
attacker behaves is dependent on

1132
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,280
new threat intelligence um

1133
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,400
[Music]

1134
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,599
also changing how um how the attacker

1135
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,680
behaves based on what type of actor

1136
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,200
threat actor we expect in in our

1137
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,640
infrastructure

1138
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,040
and also we can look at probable causes

1139
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,359
and effects of indications of compromise

1140
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:15,680
which

1141
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,440
i'm gonna demo uh for for you today and

1142
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,960
the the high level architecture

1143
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,079
is so these simulations

1144
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,119
in in socrates are triggered by a cortex

1145
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,319
analyzer so it's a it's a

1146
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,560
part of um all the framework called

1147
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,640
cortex by by the hype project

1148
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,880
and we use that to integrate with the

1149
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,280
different components

1150
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,400
so the analyzer will collect data from

1151
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,119
the imc

1152
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,960
so the infrastructure modeling component

1153
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,920
so collect data about the environment

1154
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,520
and also threat intelligence so about

1155
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,680
threat actors and yeah threat

1156
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,720
intelligence and then

1157
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,040
we have the orchestrator that is um

1158
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,800
integrating all of the components and

1159
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,839
triggering

1160
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,200
the simulation based on on specific

1161
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,480
types of scenarios or use cases

1162
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,800
so so and the functionality the adg

1163
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,520
provides

1164
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,280
is provided by a tool by us called

1165
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,040
securecad which is based on um

1166
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,440
on an open source framework called the

1167
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,280
meta attack language

1168
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,319
where you can define the logic of these

1169
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,599
types of attack simulations

1170
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,920
but the main concept is that we we

1171
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,599
create a model of the infrastructure

1172
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:35,520
we run attack simulations on that to

1173
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,760
then

1174
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,480
to then analyze our environment and find

1175
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,240
suggested mitigations the critical

1176
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,119
attack paths

1177
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,079
and also quantify how much effort is

1178
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,079
required for attacker to

1179
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,520
to succeed

1180
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,599
so these models are automatically

1181
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:54,880
generated based

1182
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,000
on data from the infrastructure modeling

1183
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:58,720
component

1184
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,319
but it can also be generated from

1185
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,720
from data sources such as your cloud

1186
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,680
infrastructure

1187
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,119
or data sources that that you have in

1188
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:09,920
your environment

1189
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,520
already so these models contains then

1190
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,119
information about your environment

1191
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,680
so the hosts and the firewalls and the

1192
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,079
users and their permissions

1193
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,920
um and and but it also

1194
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,480
contains information about soft values

1195
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,920
like um

1196
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,160
the user security awareness and if you

1197
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,480
have processes supplied

1198
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,200
for for for certain security controls

1199
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,400
and and so on

1200
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,480
and all of these all of this logic and

1201
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,640
this specification is defined in this

1202
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,119
meta attack language framework

1203
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,640
we can also account for uncertainty so

1204
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,800
you might not have data about everything

1205
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,839
in your environment

1206
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:55,359
uh or about how your users behaves on

1207
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,920
on their free time and and so on but we

1208
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,000
can account for that

1209
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,640
on uncertainty in by by using these

1210
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,520
models

1211
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,960
and also by using um

1212
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,079
monte carlo simulations uh in our in

1213
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,040
our simulation engine so what happens

1214
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,000
when we

1215
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,599
run these simulations is that we

1216
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,920
we generate these huge graphs of all

1217
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,280
possible

1218
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,800
paths of an attacker through the

1219
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,440
environment so how can an attacker move

1220
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,359
through our environment based on the

1221
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,280
data we have

1222
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,000
um and we use then monte carlo

1223
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,160
simulations to sample this graph

1224
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,240
and also do shortest path calculations

1225
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,760
to find the

1226
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,000
the shortest path or the the most likely

1227
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,599
path through this

1228
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,800
through this complex attack graph

1229
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,440
so all of the security expertise and the

1230
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,359
logic of the attacks is built into the

1231
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:49,920
tool

1232
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,040
so you don't have to have that expertise

1233
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,760
but the tool does that for you and by

1234
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,359
doing this we can also quantify the

1235
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:58,319
results

1236
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,319
and the metric that we use is called

1237
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,160
time to compromise

1238
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,480
and that's basically the probability

1239
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,200
over time

1240
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,520
that an attacker will succeed and you

1241
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,280
can see it as

1242
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,079
like effort required for an attacker so

1243
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,640
low timed compromise means that

1244
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,240
it is very certain that attacker will

1245
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,880
succeed and it requires no effort at all

1246
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,480
a high time to compromise means that

1247
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,240
it's really complicated and it might

1248
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,520
require some complex types of attacks or

1249
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,200
there is a lot of uncertainty

1250
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,240
in in this in the simulation and then

1251
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,599
based on the simulation

1252
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,520
uh the tool would then generate reports

1253
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,119
on your risk exposure

1254
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,800
um the

1255
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,319
the threats and weaknesses that you

1256
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,880
might have uh and the impact to your

1257
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,640
high value assets and also these

1258
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,240
critical paths to

1259
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,400
to these high value assets and this path

1260
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,680
will then expose

1261
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,079
how an attacker would be able to move

1262
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,359
through your environment

1263
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,599
but also how we can stop that accuracy

1264
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:56,960
as soon as possible

1265
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,040
what we call suggested security controls

1266
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,880
or suggested mitigations

1267
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,559
so how can we stop the attacker from

1268
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,920
succeeding as

1269
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,599
soon as possible so i'm going to show

1270
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:08,640
you how this

1271
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,920
this works in in in a brief demo

1272
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,960
and i'm going to show you uh in an aws

1273
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,000
environment a

1274
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,160
testbed that we have set up in aws

1275
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,000
i don't have access to the socrates

1276
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,240
platform at the moment we will use

1277
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,960
guard duty as the threat detection in in

1278
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,200
this case for aws

1279
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,359
uh but that's a great thing about socret

1280
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:32,880
is the platform as well that it's

1281
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,240
modular and you can

1282
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,280
change out components um

1283
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,520
as as you deploy it so in this case we

1284
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,319
will look at

1285
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:44,559
aws and we will use card duty to

1286
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,280
to detect the threat in our environment

1287
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,079
so

1288
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,160
the aws environment that we have is a

1289
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,119
small simple

1290
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:54,720
multi-vpc environment we have a few

1291
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,720
virtual machines

1292
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,640
some networking and pairing and load

1293
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,480
balancing

1294
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,680
and we have some sensitive data here

1295
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,319
uh we have some customer records in an

1296
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,839
s3 bucket so a

1297
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,720
storage service in aws and we also have

1298
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,760
some customer data

1299
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,400
in in a database so that's our our high

1300
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,440
value assets in this case

1301
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,880
and now guard duty has detected um

1302
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,040
or had raised an alarm because we have

1303
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,200
some command and control activity direct

1304
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:25,599
uh

1305
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,800
detected on on a bastion host in in

1306
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,760
our environment so that is our starting

1307
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,200
point when when i run this

1308
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,760
when i run this demo and we're going to

1309
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,559
look at

1310
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,720
the impact the possible impact of this

1311
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,599
command and control activity

1312
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,960
also look at the root cause so we can

1313
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,960
see how was the attacker able to reach

1314
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,040
this bastion host

1315
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,400
and we're going to look at some top

1316
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,880
threats and suggested mitigations for

1317
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,240
for this environment so

1318
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,359
i'm going to jump over to um to

1319
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:00,880
securecad

1320
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,520
and what we see here now is a is a list

1321
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,760
of collected data from our environment

1322
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,319
which is aws in this case so

1323
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,559
so the tool will automatically generate

1324
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:13,359
a model

1325
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,480
of your environment and we can take a

1326
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,520
look at that

1327
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,559
here so what we see now

1328
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,920
is a visualization of our our aws

1329
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,200
environment

1330
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,400
we can zoom in a bit here to see

1331
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,440
our customer database for example

1332
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,599
a virtual machine called our web server

1333
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,280
and we also have our bastion host here

1334
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,000
and i can just show you quickly here in

1335
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,839
in aws

1336
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,200
so um this is the aws console and this

1337
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,040
is the virtual machines that is running

1338
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,160
in our in our demo environment so what

1339
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,119
we see here is

1340
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,760
a representation of that data that we

1341
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,800
have actually in

1342
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,400
aws right now so it's all your

1343
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,800
network configuration the im set up all

1344
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,480
the users and their permissions

1345
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,359
and and so on and all of that is is

1346
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:10,319
represented in this model

1347
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,559
what we can also see here is our

1348
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:13,599
attacker

1349
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,599
coming from the internet in this case

1350
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,079
but it is also connected directly to

1351
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:21,119
our bastion host so

1352
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,240
um so we had this uh

1353
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,839
command and control activity in our

1354
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,520
environment

1355
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,200
so that hacker will start from that

1356
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,280
bastion host and we will then see how

1357
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:31,839
that

1358
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,960
could affect our our environment

1359
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,800
so this is the like the attack scenario

1360
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,880
that we that we are gonna

1361
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,839
gonna simulate um

1362
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,680
so let's go back and look at

1363
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,760
the report for that simulation so we

1364
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,160
have based on

1365
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,240
the threat detected by guard duty in

1366
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,200
this case

1367
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,319
we started a scenario and got

1368
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:01,839
a simulation of of that scenario and we

1369
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:04,240
are now looking at the report for

1370
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,280
for for that specific case

1371
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,400
so we get some high high level

1372
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,680
risk exposure values

1373
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,880
and we also get get detailed information

1374
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,079
about our high value

1375
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,760
assets so if you remember we had the

1376
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,319
customer database and an s3 bucket with

1377
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:27,599
some sensitive customer data

1378
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,760
and we can see based on our simulations

1379
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,839
that from the bastion host attacker is

1380
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:32,800
able to

1381
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,040
yeah basically read all of our customer

1382
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,000
data

1383
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,040
also delete and write uh the

1384
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,480
customer data in our in our database

1385
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,319
here

1386
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,240
and the time to compromise as mentioned

1387
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,160
earlier is really low which means the

1388
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,760
attacker is succeeding

1389
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,680
very easily and with a very high

1390
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,520
probability

1391
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,599
and we can look at why that is now so

1392
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,119
so now we're looking at one of these

1393
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,760
critical paths so how is the attacker

1394
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,319
able

1395
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:06,800
to impact our high value assets based on

1396
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,280
based on the threat detection that we

1397
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,800
got

1398
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,559
so the attacker is starting on our

1399
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,319
bastion host because that's where we got

1400
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:15,040
the alarm

1401
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,720
we know there is some suspicious

1402
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,400
activity here

1403
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,599
and then based on our our aws

1404
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,160
configuration in this case the attacker

1405
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,119
is able to

1406
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,160
exfiltrate credentials to a database

1407
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,839
management role which is attached to

1408
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,359
this virtual machine

1409
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:34,559
which then lets the attacker

1410
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,960
basically change the master password to

1411
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,760
the database

1412
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,040
and then compromise it completely

1413
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,480
and in this case read the database

1414
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,319
so that is how the attacker succeeded

1415
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:47,520
with our database

1416
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:52,800
if we look at the s3 bucket

1417
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,800
we can we get some other paths um

1418
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,960
and here we can actually see that

1419
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,800
there's also a vulnerability

1420
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,319
in our our environment here because

1421
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:07,280
with the with the integration with other

1422
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,359
components we can also take data from

1423
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,200
for example a vulnerability scanner and

1424
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,480
see how these vulnerabilities could

1425
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,040
could affect us in the context of our

1426
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,880
environment

1427
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,200
so as we see here the attacker is also

1428
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,720
able to reach our

1429
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,880
s3 bucket based on this vulnerability

1430
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,440
but there are also other paths so if you

1431
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,880
remember these are monte carlo

1432
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,559
simulations like a

1433
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,720
statistical method so there are other

1434
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,079
paths that are possible

1435
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,079
but they are less likely and will

1436
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,799
produce a higher time to compromise

1437
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:44,000
uh which uh so so they are less likely

1438
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,359
to to succeed

1439
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,280
but they are still possible given the

1440
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,559
the configuration

1441
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,960
and the attacker profile so the type of

1442
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,760
attacker we

1443
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,880
are we are simulating

1444
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,640
um and we also get some

1445
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,960
some information about common

1446
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,720
denominators between these attacks

1447
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,760
risk exposure and risk factors

1448
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,880
um so threat summaries so what types of

1449
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,240
threats are we

1450
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,280
experiencing so these these

1451
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,400
types of these risk values and the

1452
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,319
threats and so on are communicated

1453
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,960
to other components in in the socrates

1454
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,000
platform

1455
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,839
so other components will use this data

1456
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:27,599
to perform other

1457
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:30,640
other types of of analysis

1458
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,440
so for example these threats are also

1459
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,400
mapped to

1460
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,400
like stride and mitral attack which can

1461
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,000
be used in other

1462
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,799
reporting features in in the platform as

1463
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,480
well

1464
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,720
and also the suggested mitigations so

1465
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,160
what should we

1466
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,280
what should we do about this so in the

1467
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,599
socrates platform we also have component

1468
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:52,640
called

1469
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,160
course of action generator so this gives

1470
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,880
information to the sock operator what

1471
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,000
you can do to

1472
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,680
to fix this or to lower the risk

1473
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,480
exposure and also

1474
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,680
um come up with strategies so

1475
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,079
how in what order should we apply these

1476
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,240
mitigations and when should we do them

1477
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,359
to to lower the risk exposure but also

1478
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,200
to make sure that we have

1479
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,960
um a good uptime and don't disrupt

1480
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,359
anything and so on

1481
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:26,480
three minutes so yeah eric

1482
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,520
yeah so

1483
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,160
just last thing i want to to say um we

1484
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,520
can also have different types of

1485
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,559
attacker profiles

1486
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,640
like how abt-28 would behave or how

1487
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,119
some other types of apt would would

1488
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,839
behave based on the threat intelligence

1489
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:44,720
that we

1490
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,760
that we get um

1491
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,200
yeah and i think frank has some

1492
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,680
concluding remarks in

1493
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,000
30 seconds yeah so so we've seen that

1494
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,520
what we think is that this can be

1495
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,440
beneficial for shock season operations

1496
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,960
to increase speed of operations and

1497
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,680
facilitate

1498
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,240
informed decision making socrates

1499
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,720
platform will

1500
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,440
pilot the platform in the first half of

1501
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,680
2022

1502
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,960
and at the end of that we will have a

1503
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,640
demo pilot where we have an event

1504
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,200
problem

1505
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,640
so that that's the plan um another thing

1506
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,319
is that most of the components

1507
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:22,720
will be open sourced some of them are

1508
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,760
already open source

1509
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,040
and and yeah you can follow us at on uh

1510
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,640
on the website of the socrates and we

1511
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,799
are on twitter and linkedin um

1512
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:35,040
so hopefully next year we have a

1513
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,799
demo where we can show the whole uh

1514
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:40,000
platform

1515
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
thank you and we are going to uh the

1516
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,040
the work uh adventure for uh additional

1517
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,040
questions

1518
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,400
thank you thank you

1519
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,240
okay thank you uh frank and eric um

1520
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,359
very interesting talk and uh and uh

1521
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:00,000
please

1522
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,480
uh give them a virtual run of approach

1523
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,319
it's uh okay so uh and uh

1524
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:11,200
also thank you for the participants and

1525
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:11,839
uh

1526
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:15,200
you should find them in and uh

1527
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,559
kind of the q and a room

1528
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:21,599
uh on the first floor of our work

1529
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,880
adventure so uh if you have any

session is uh

1619
01:15:32,199 --> 01:15:36,840
csaf 2.0 and use start to automate

1620
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,320
advisories this rising number of the

1621
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:43,360
uh discovered vulnerabilities

1622
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,640
uh today is a make a

1623
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,679
huge amount of the coordinate disclosure

1624
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:50,000
and

1625
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,480
advisories that is uh too many to manage

1626
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,560
and process by each product users to

1627
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:55,199
keep their

1628
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:58,080
cyber risk level low this process is

1629
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,159
very time consuming from the issuers to

1630
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:02,080
user especially if the user is

1631
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,159
in the business that is having not only

1632
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:05,199
id but ot

1633
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:08,480
inside of their industry so this talk

1634
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,640
presents a way to reduce that resource

1635
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:11,760
by using the

1636
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,120
common security advisories uh framework

1637
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,640
or csaf

1638
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,199
that will automate the process on both

1639
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:20,320
advisories

1640
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,199
issues and asset users especially when

1641
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:25,040
users which are vendors

1642
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,960
this that is happening supplies i need

1643
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,360
to look into the supply chain issues

1644
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:32,719
and ca csaf provides these checks

1645
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:35,280
through its automation so let's welcome

1646
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,080

1697
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:00,320
since that's

1698
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:03,760
actually one of the the key parts

1699
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:07,760
here um if you have one or two vendors

1700
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,840
that's fairly easy to handle to to look

1701
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,520
out for their advisories

1702
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:15,760
but if you have maybe 20 to 50

1703
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,159
it might get a little bit more complex

1704
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:19,440
to do that

1705
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,480
um if you have

1706
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:27,600
hundreds of vendors um it might be

1707
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,360
mostly undoable um so

1708
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,760
but um there might also be a be a case

1709
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,199
where you don't really know how many

1710
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:37,040
vendors do we actually have

1711
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,550
in in our companies um

1712
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:41,120
[Music]

1713
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:44,159
so i'm not looking for a

1714
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:47,600
correct number i'm just looking for a

1715
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,719
rough guest

1716
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:53,840
so and i think we give it one more

1717
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,040
minute

1718
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:58,080
so please join and and

1719
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:01,360
put in your results i'm gonna try

1720
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:02,960
something real quick and see if i can

1721
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,360
show the results in real time as well

1722
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:10,799
there we go oh perfect sorry guys

1723
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,040
the workings of my desktop

1724
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,960
that's quite an interesting result um

1725
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:23,040
most of you don't know um

1726
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,639
and twenty percent i'm saying they have

1727
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:29,760
less than ten um so i'm

1728
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,520
i'm really thrilled to speak to those

1729
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:32,960
people in the q and a

1730
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:38,080
afterwards um so

1731
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,040
all right oh still moving thomas you

1732
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,040
just you just tell me when you want

1733
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:46,159
you want control of your slides back

1734
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:49,520
um i think we we take that um

1735
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,239
okay that's the first one and please

1736
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:53,440
join also

1737
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:56,639
our next question um which will be there

1738
01:20:56,639 --> 01:21:00,719
in just a few seconds so

1739
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:04,000
let me share my slides

1740
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,639
you will exactly tell to the audience

1741
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:08,239
about the what is the purpose of

1742
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:12,000
this poll right thomas

1743
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,320
so i'll come to that in just a second

1744
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,440
okay thank you so when we look at the

1745
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,920
coordination time frame it is

1746
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,639
mostly a vendor becomes aware of

1747
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:25,600
vulnerability

1748
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,760
and he analyzes the vulnerability so

1749
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,120
that's that's normal

1750
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,800
coordinated vulnerability disclosure

1751
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,440
stuff and at some point he releases a

1752
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,679
patch and advisory

1753
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:38,159
and at some later point in time the

1754
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:40,000
asset owner does something and

1755
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,520
this does something could be patch or

1756
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:47,120
motivate risk or actively actively

1757
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,400
accept the risk and what we're looking

1758
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:50,960
at

1759
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:54,639
is so our time frame of concern is

1760
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:56,960
from the point where the vendor releases

1761
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,120
the patch or advisory

1762
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,199
until the asset owner does something

1763
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:02,719
since that's under the control of the

1764
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:03,520
asset owner

1765
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:06,800
and we think this this time frame is way

1766
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,199
too long

1767
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:13,360
so um that brings me

1768
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:16,400
to my second question um

1769
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,560
which is basically do you automate

1770
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,320
advisory handling

1771
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:24,960
um tracy please go ahead sure thing

1772
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,719
one sec here all right it looks like

1773
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:30,320
uh people have already been skipping

1774
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:33,440
ahead yes so you can join selito here

1775
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,239
you can uh point your phone and go use

1776
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:38,000
the qr code or you can go to

1777
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,800
sleeto.com and punch in this number and

1778
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,960
you should be able to once you get into

1779
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:43,600
the event

1780
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:46,960
be able to see thomas's questions here

1781
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:49,280
as well

1782
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,960
so the interesting question here is if

1783
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,239
i have so many vendors

1784
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:59,280
and i know it's a time consuming process

1785
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:02,320
do i actually already have some

1786
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,159
automation here do i

1787
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:07,840
have methods and procedures in place

1788
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:11,600
which help me to to automate

1789
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:15,120
these advisories and automate that

1790
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:19,199
against my asset database as well as

1791
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:21,840
have that automatically retrieved from

1792
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,560
the vendors

1793
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:30,320
and we're still seeing some changes here

1794
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:30,639
so

1795
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:34,000
i'm i'm really interested in since it's

1796
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,760
it's changing so quickly um

1797
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:40,639
but most of you at the moment at least

1798
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:41,280
think

1799
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,840
you wish there was some automation and

1800
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:44,480
that's

1801
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:47,520
actually the need csef addresses

1802
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,960
um and i'll go over

1803
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:54,560
that in just a minute

1804
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:57,840
to to show what we have found um what

1805
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,280
could be

1806
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:02,719
helped in here

1807
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:06,480
and i'm i'm really interested in

1808
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:09,040
the people who are saying yes and it's

1809
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,000
great

1810
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,440
um since i don't know um

1811
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,440
such tools which are already available

1812
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,480
so

1813
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,120
please come to talk to me in the q a

1814
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,440
session

1815
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,800
all right um we

1816
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,040
have one more question later on so

1817
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:28,719
please be ready for that

1818
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:32,080
and we just go ahead in

1819
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:36,639
the presentation

1820
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,360
and look into the process how it's

1821
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:40,880
usually done

1822
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:43,199
so if you have a manually advisory

1823
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:45,199
handling process

1824
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:47,360
that's mostly there is a vendor out

1825
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:50,159
there puts out human readable advisories

1826
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:54,000
for example 15 advisories with

1827
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,960
different kinds of severity and you can

1828
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,480
think of the severity

1829
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,600
maybe like a cvs escort and then you go

1830
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,400
ahead

1831
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,960
you search on the websites are there any

1832
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,199
new or updated advisories you download

1833
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:08,159
them all

1834
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:11,520
you prioritize them um

1835
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:13,040
by the criticality of the

1836
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,960
vulnerabilities and you might have

1837
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:18,560
you're you're very critical up front and

1838
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:19,040
then

1839
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,920
it it goes back until you deal with the

1840
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:22,880
low critical

1841
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,000
key ones and then you do for each

1842
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,600
advisory

1843
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,000
one kind of a cycle which is basically

1844
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:30,719
do i have

1845
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:33,520
effective devices if no i don't care

1846
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,440
about the advisory just

1847
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:38,159
scrub it off the list and then do a risk

1848
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:40,480
assessment as a second step um

1849
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,400
what's actually the risk involved with

1850
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,600
this

1851
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,560
is this deep down in my network where i

1852
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,440
have

1853
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,840
plenty of of defense and depth layers

1854
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:50,719
before that

1855
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:53,520
or is it an internet-facing device and

1856
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:54,239
then

1857
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:56,480
you have to decide which actions you

1858
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:59,678
want to take

1859
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:03,440
and that's actually

1860
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,880
quite a lot of a process as it's not

1861
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,600
a one-day job we're saying oh i do this

1862
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:10,880
once a week or

1863
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:14,239
once a month but vendors are constantly

1864
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:17,840
putting out such advisories

1865
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,520
and you have to repeat this process

1866
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:21,440
constantly

1867
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,480
so the first step was finding these

1868
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,560
it is basically a mess you go through

1869
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,159
all these websites and i

1870
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:31,920
just listed a few of them here and then

1871
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,400
you have to analyze this stuff and it's

1872
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,719
all different formats html

1873
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:39,920
pdf text files

1874
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:42,960
signed unsigned and it

1875
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:47,120
has all the different structure um

1876
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:50,159
but then the interesting question is if

1877
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:53,360
i have to do this with free advisories

1878
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:56,719
i don't care um how many advisories

1879
01:26:56,719 --> 01:26:58,719
do we have actually to deal with and

1880
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:00,800
that's a question which i would like to

1881
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,679
to put on to you and tracy please go

1882
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:04,000
ahead

1883
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,440
share slide three

1884
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,719
all right looks like we have some folks

1885
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:12,159
who've already answered it

1886
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:14,239
so again if you're just joining us you

1887
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:15,199
can point your

1888
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:17,600
mobile device at the qr code or you can

1889
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,679
head over to sleedo.com

1890
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:22,880
and punch in the 446-725 to join the

1891
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,120
poll

1892
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:27,840
and we're really looking for

1893
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,880
participation here

1894
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,840
come on

1895
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,880
so that's that's quite an interesting

1896
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:37,520
question

1897
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:41,760
um since if you do that for

1898
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,840
say on one advisory a

1899
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:48,400
that's probably not too bad i can handle

1900
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:49,040
that

1901
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:52,880
it's probably half an hour work for an

1902
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,800
advisory goes through all the different

1903
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:55,679
steps

1904
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:57,600
but then still the question is how do

1905
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,440
you get informed about

1906
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,960
the advisories um

1907
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,280
how do you get notified about them do

1908
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,199
you re do i really have to

1909
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:11,280
to look into um

1910
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,880
all the websites every day so

1911
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,800
that i don't miss an advisory which

1912
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,400
might be critical or

1913
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,360
is there any notification by the vendor

1914
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:22,000
which

1915
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,360
which gives me some intel that there is

1916
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:27,280
a new advisory

1917
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:30,239
and how do i find it is it behind a

1918
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:30,800
portal

1919
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,000
or is it somewhere um where i can

1920
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,960
easily access that and that's quite

1921
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:37,760
interesting

1922
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:41,600
nobody have 30 to 75

1923
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:45,440
advisories um

1924
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:50,400
having said that just one joint

1925
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:54,880
um yeah so

1926
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:58,159
if you're if you're around zero to

1927
01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:01,360
30 advisories i probably think you

1928
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:03,199
either have

1929
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:05,120
advisory handling isn't is not really

1930
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,960
your business

1931
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,679
or um you don't have that many vendors

1932
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:10,560
to watch

1933
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:13,600
that's perfect congratulations

1934
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:16,400
um but really when you come to to in the

1935
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:18,800
industrial space it's it's

1936
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:22,000
huge there are huge um installations and

1937
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,760
they have all these different vendors in

1938
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:24,400
them

1939
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:28,080
and you have to to look into

1940
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:30,400
how many vendors do i have there how

1941
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,239
many assets do i have there

1942
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:36,239
and where do i get all the advisors

1943
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:39,360
and we'll stop there with the

1944
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:41,120
questions and come back to the

1945
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,199
presentation and

1946
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:46,320
give you some

1947
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:49,199
insights what we expect that to look

1948
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:50,560
like

1949
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:53,600
um so as i didn't have a clear

1950
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:57,040
number of advisory i just looked at um

1951
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:00,080
cves since there might be

1952
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:03,280
a cbe there i know there is not for each

1953
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:04,320
advisory

1954
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,920
a single cv and sometimes

1955
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:10,639
there are more cves and more advisories

1956
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:11,920
so

1957
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,080
but it gives us an idea how it looks

1958
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,280
over the years

1959
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:17,840
and if you look to that and that's

1960
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,040
mapped out from

1961
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:23,120
i think so each dot is a year

1962
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:26,159
if you look to that it's actually rising

1963
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:29,280
constantly um

1964
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:32,320
so and we estimate that's an exponential

1965
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,000
rise

1966
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,480
in cves and also in advisories

1967
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:41,760
so in the current situation we have this

1968
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,440
existence of a human

1969
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:46,000
readable format and then we have to

1970
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,679
manually process that

1971
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:49,840
we only need a web browser for that and

1972
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:50,800
as a vendor

1973
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,520
you can do that with word or any text

1974
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:56,000
writer

1975
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,480
but really if if we want to have

1976
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:00,719
automation in that step we need

1977
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:03,199
a machine variable format so that we can

1978
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:03,920
automate

1979
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,320
the processing of our advisories and

1980
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,239
that we can have

1981
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:11,840
some some content management

1982
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:14,239
system on the vendor side which actually

1983
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:16,560
produces this machine readable format

1984
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,040
and then gives us the opportunity on the

1985
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,480
asset owner side

1986
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:23,840
to have a smart search there

1987
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,679
and compare this with our asset

1988
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:28,239
inventory

1989
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,880
we're not at a point where we really

1990
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,880
have unique product ids

1991
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:35,440
since you know from s-bomb naming is a

1992
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:36,480
hard problem

1993
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:40,480
so um we just start one step

1994
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:43,679
at a time and start to to automate

1995
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:45,679
advisories with bringing in a machinery

1996
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:47,600
level format

1997
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,600
and this machine readable for the format

1998
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,360
is called common security advisory

1999
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:52,719
framework

2000
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:55,840
um current major version is

2001
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:59,280
2.0 it is json format

2002
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,440
it's machine readable and it's really

2003
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,199
built with automation in mind so

2004
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:06,320
we have all that coming in from

2005
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:09,440
having conformance standards

2006
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:11,920
down to how to distribute csaf

2007
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,679
advisories

2008
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:15,600
standardization is done through the

2009
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,320
oasis open which is also represented at

2010
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:19,120
first

2011
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:22,080
and we have the csaf technical committee

2012
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,400
there

2013
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:27,280
and it's actually we always get asked

2014
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,440
about cvrf cvrf

2015
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:34,559
is the um predecessor of csaf

2016
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:37,280
if you look at an example a csef

2017
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:38,480
document

2018
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:42,080
actually has three

2019
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:44,239
parts so there is document level

2020
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:45,440
metadata

2021
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:49,040
with all your tracking numbers and

2022
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:52,800
your version of the advisory and the

2023
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,920
revision history and the title and some

2024
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:57,520
some generic information about the

2025
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:59,440
publisher then you have

2026
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,679
as a second part your product free where

2027
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:03,440
you define all the products

2028
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:06,400
used later on in the document and in the

2029
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:07,520
third part

2030
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:10,320
you have the vulnerabilities listed as

2031
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:10,960
well

2032
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:14,159
to which products they apply and

2033
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:17,440
what scores apply to them and for this

2034
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,840
remediation action which you should take

2035
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:23,440
there

2036
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,840
this brings us to an automated handling

2037
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,400
process

2038
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:31,679
and the vendor doesn't really change

2039
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:32,320
much

2040
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:35,920
he just produces machine readable

2041
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:36,960
advisories

2042
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:40,239
and publish them but now we

2043
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:43,360
as as the asset owners or as the

2044
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:44,880
downstream vendors

2045
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:48,000
could go ahead and say um

2046
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,880
i automate these this finding step i

2047
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:51,760
don't want to

2048
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:54,000
search through websites and download

2049
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,199
that manually

2050
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:58,480
that can be automated and we get a

2051
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:01,600
another big advantage here we can have

2052
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:02,639
some automation

2053
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:05,840
in the search do i have affected devices

2054
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:08,800
so i can actually reduce the numbers of

2055
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,760
advisories which i have to look into

2056
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:15,120
tremendously just by comparing that to

2057
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,120
my asset database

2058
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:20,400
in a structured format i can add a

2059
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,560
static risk assessment

2060
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,679
so for example advisory

2061
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:28,880
9 might be about

2062
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:31,360
an internet-facing device so that's

2063
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:32,560
really something

2064
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,840
which i want to look at first since

2065
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:38,320
i'm exposed to a potential threat from

2066
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:39,520
the outside

2067
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:42,400
um by not having that vulnerability risk

2068
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:43,840
assessed

2069
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:46,400
and there might be another vulnerability

2070
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:47,760
say number 12

2071
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:51,040
which is actually laid way down in my

2072
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:51,920
network

2073
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:55,760
um very much layer of defense

2074
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:58,880
above them before an attacker can get to

2075
01:34:58,880 --> 01:34:59,280
them

2076
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:02,480
so i might take an environmental score

2077
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:07,440
and put it a little bit further down

2078
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,760
so and then i have the the new

2079
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:12,560
criticality of my vulnerabilities

2080
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:15,840
and have that automated adopted

2081
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:18,960
so now i have only instead of 15 i've

2082
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,199
only

2083
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:24,400
a lesser number of of advisories

2084
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:27,679
say seven which i have to look at

2085
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:30,239
which are sorted by criticality and now

2086
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:32,560
i only have to look into that and

2087
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,199
and think what decisions do i want to

2088
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:37,678
take care

2089
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:41,520
if you look in the csap specification i

2090
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,360
want to give you a short

2091
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:46,400
introduction to that so that you find

2092
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:49,040
where you have what you have in which

2093
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:49,920
chapter

2094
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,159
first two chapters that's introduction

2095
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:53,280
and

2096
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:56,639
design considerations and then

2097
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:58,560
all these schema elements of the json

2098
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,960
schema get explained

2099
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:04,000
but unfortunately we can't deal with all

2100
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:04,480
that

2101
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:07,280
in the in the json schema so we have

2102
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,719
some tests

2103
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:10,960
some of them are mandatory which render

2104
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:13,679
a document invalid when you fail a test

2105
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:16,080
of them some are optional and some are

2106
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:17,360
informative

2107
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:20,400
um just to let you know what's best

2108
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,000
practices

2109
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,040
and what could you add to make it more

2110
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:27,679
valuable to your customers

2111
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:30,800
and then we have a chapter about how you

2112
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:33,280
should distribute the csaf documents

2113
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:37,119
um we also add as a standard in

2114
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:40,239
every publication safety security and

2115
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:42,320
data protection consideration

2116
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:45,520
and we add conformance targets

2117
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:48,480
and these conformance targets will allow

2118
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:49,679
software vendors

2119
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:53,440
to describe that their product is

2120
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,440
a valid product against the standard and

2121
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:56,800
implements the standard

2122
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:59,119
and also gives customers the opportunity

2123
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:00,880
if they look for a software

2124
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:04,000
um just something like a vendor is

2125
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,320
looking for a content management system

2126
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:09,520
which produces csf documents he has

2127
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:11,679
a way to go there and and find the

2128
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:14,000
software

2129
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,440
um we have

2130
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:20,639
stackvisogram as one of the first

2131
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:22,000
available tools

2132
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,400
it's already on github and you can

2133
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:25,760
freely use that

2134
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:28,880
um you see a picture of that here it's

2135
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:32,880
basically click and

2136
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:37,040
and join um the items into

2137
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:40,480
the json format you have

2138
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,639
also a human readable preview of the

2139
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:44,560
machine readable format

2140
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:47,040
we have a csev visualizer which gives

2141
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,719
you all

2142
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:52,000
the structure of the document um in a

2143
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:52,880
more

2144
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:56,239
readable way and there's also something

2145
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:57,920
which will implement the tests

2146
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:03,280
at some point and it's called c7

2147
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:06,560
when i always say we have something then

2148
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:08,320
the question is who is actually involved

2149
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:08,800
in the

2150
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,480
development of csf and that's big

2151
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:12,800
companies industry lad

2152
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:16,239
um from cisco microsoft red hat oracle a

2153
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:16,800
t and t

2154
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:19,840
siemens but it's also part um

2155
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:23,360
like psi is there but to really make

2156
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,560
that work

2157
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:27,600
it's we need to the support of

2158
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:31,840
the community we need your support

2159
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,760
we do have some unsolved problems um

2160
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,840
like the unique product identifiers

2161
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:40,239
if you have a solution for that please

2162
01:38:40,239 --> 01:38:42,000
talk to alan friedman

2163
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,600
at s-bomb he's pretty lucky if he had a

2164
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,440
solution for the naming problem

2165
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:51,760
and we will probably adopt that um

2166
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:55,360
we don't have an an idea of an api yet

2167
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,000
so it's

2168
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,400
at the moment all filebase you'll

2169
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,880
probably add that in a later version

2170
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:04,239
of csaf

2171
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:06,400
we're looking into an aggregator

2172
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,480
infrastructure and how that might

2173
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:09,520
develop

2174
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:12,400
over time so at the moment you would

2175
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:13,199
have to go

2176
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:18,800
to your 100 to 500 vendors or

2177
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:21,119
less vendors if you select if you have

2178
01:39:21,119 --> 01:39:22,880
less vendors

2179
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:26,080
and collect for each of them in

2180
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:29,199
a single instance the advisories but

2181
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:31,280
we have this idea that maybe national

2182
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:32,239
search

2183
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:35,360
could use an infrastructure

2184
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:38,560
to provide it as a one-stop shop

2185
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,280
all the advisories which they collected

2186
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,600
we have also some ideas around

2187
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:47,199
how to solve configuration issues so if

2188
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:49,040
you have a certain configuration

2189
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:51,360
a product might be vulnerable if you

2190
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,840
don't have

2191
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:58,000
might be um not vulnerable so

2192
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,040
that's basically um what we are going to

2193
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:02,159
look into

2194
01:40:02,159 --> 01:40:05,840
the next versions of csf

2195
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:09,040
so here are the key takeaways

2196
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:11,679
um the number of vulnerabilities arising

2197
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:13,280
and also is the number of security

2198
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:15,119
advisories

2199
01:40:15,119 --> 01:40:16,960
we need these security advisories to

2200
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:19,040
make our risk-based decisions should we

2201
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:19,920
patch

2202
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:23,199
should we wait should we accept the risk

2203
01:40:23,199 --> 01:40:26,800
um and since that's time consuming and

2204
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:29,760
and also resource consuming we should

2205
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:31,760
automate the boring stuff

2206
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:34,800
as automation as possible so

2207
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,960
please take action request your vendors

2208
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:38,560
to provide csaf

2209
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:41,440
documents provide csaf documents if

2210
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,280
you're a vendor or if you're in industry

2211
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,239
organizations

2212
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:47,600
to your customers to ease their pain and

2213
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:50,080
last but not least spread the word about

2214
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:51,840
csf

2215
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:56,560
i'll leave more information for you here

2216
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:58,960
um where you can find the specification

2217
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,159
and also

2218
01:41:00,159 --> 01:41:03,040
segwaygram the tool i've talked off it

2219
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:03,760
is

2220
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:07,040
not complete it will develop along the

2221
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:08,159
standard

2222
01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:11,440
and we will make sure that you can

2223
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:14,560
play around with this um always having

2224
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:15,119
the

2225
01:41:15,119 --> 01:41:18,400
the current standards there

2226
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:21,679
and that was my presentation

2252
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,920
we will go to the next talk sessions

2253
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,040
with the title of the

2254
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:29,840
xero trust security for the enterprise

2255
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:32,239
and

2256
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:42,719
let's wait for the transitions

2257
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:44,960
there he is hi jason hi good morning

2258
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:47,520
good afternoon how's everyone doing

2259
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:50,400
okay thank you very much for attending

2260
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:50,960
the

2261
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:54,719
event right now uh

2262
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:56,480
about the zero trust security for the

2263
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:57,760
enterprise

2264
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:00,320
instead of legendary tcpip zero trust is

2265
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,159
a model that enforces the principle of

2266
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:03,760
lease privileges

2267
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,000
across the network since the ability to

2268
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,440
establish a connection

2269
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:09,520
to the system is in fact a preference

2270
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:10,639
itself

2271
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:13,920
therefore systems must authorize all

2272
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,760
users before they can do so which is

2273
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:16,800
making xero trust

2274
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:20,000
approach hide systems from the all

2275
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,119
unauthorized users so in this talk uh

2276
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:24,239
the speaker

2277
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:27,679

2284
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:41,920

i have a number of roles i happen to

2291
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:58,239
i work for a software vendor called

2292
01:43:58,239 --> 01:43:59,840
appgate and we make a zero trust

2293
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:00,960
security platform

2294
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:03,280
uh but i'm not here to promote that or

2295
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:05,520
to to put that hat on really i'm here as

2296
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:08,560
a participant in the industry one of my

2297
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:10,400
roles is that i'm one of the co-chairs

2298
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:10,880
of

2299
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:12,400
the software defined perimeter zero

2300
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:13,840
trust working group with cloud security

2301
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:14,719
alliance

2302
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:17,040
and in that role i work with folks

2303
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:18,719
across the industry to help

2304
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:21,199
publish research papers to advance

2305
01:44:21,199 --> 01:44:23,040
knowledge and best practices around xero

2306
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:23,840
trust

2307
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,840
and the open architecture called the

2308
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,360
software defined perimeter

2309
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:29,040
i also recently wrote a book called xero

2310
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:30,800
trust security and enterprise guide

2311
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:33,520
which provides a historical and current

2312
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:34,159
analysis

2313
01:44:34,159 --> 01:44:35,600
of zero trust and then looking at it

2314
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,280
from the lens of enterprise

2315
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:38,880
architectures and explaining how this

2316
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,800
trend in the industry calls your trust

2317
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:43,199
um can and should be interpreted and

2318
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:45,199
applied by enterprises

2319
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:46,800
i'll let you know upfront i'm not an

2320
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,320
incident response

2321
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,000
expert by any means so everyone in the

2322
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,280
audience knows more about incident

2323
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:53,040
response than i do

2324
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:54,639
and what i'm going to be doing in this

2325
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:56,480
presentation is talking about zero trust

2326
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:57,280
giving you

2327
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:59,199
some perspective on what it is why we're

2328
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:01,600
here and hopefully

2329
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:03,199
to give you some encouragement for the

2330
01:45:03,199 --> 01:45:05,199
enterprises that you're working with or

2331
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:06,080
working for

2332
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:07,520
to have them adopt and embrace zero

2333
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:09,280
trust and then we'll look at it through

2334
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:11,840
the the standard model of the incident

2335
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,040
response phases

2336
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:15,360
to try to understand how a zero trust

2337
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:17,360
enterprise and enterprise architecture

2338
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:19,280
could be different in uh from an

2339
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:21,119
incident response perspective

2340
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:22,639
um this definitely the beginning of what

2341
01:45:22,639 --> 01:45:23,600
i hope will be a really good

2342
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,119
conversation from

2343
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:27,360
the incident response community for

2344
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,560
using and

2345
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:31,360
working in zero trust environments so

2346
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:34,000
let's go ahead and dive right in here

2347
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,199
so first and bad news and this is

2348
01:45:37,199 --> 01:45:38,480
not really going to be news maybe it's

2349
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:40,239
just bad but

2350
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:42,239
the reality in our world that all of you

2351
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:44,000
know that we all live in every day is

2352
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:44,639
that

2353
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:47,199
we live in a very complex and very

2354
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:48,400
highly different

2355
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:51,119
uh very differentiated i.t

2356
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:52,639
infrastructure

2357
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:56,080
landscape compared to 10 or 15 years ago

2358
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:58,080
if you just look at how applications are

2359
01:45:58,080 --> 01:45:59,600
being built how businesses are running

2360
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:00,159
today

2361
01:46:00,159 --> 01:46:02,639
there's a huge adoption of fantastically

2362
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:04,880
powerful and amazing platforms from

2363
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:06,560
infrastructure and platform as a service

2364
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,400
for virtualization containerized

2365
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:11,360
workloads service meshes etc

2366
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:13,440
however what this has done is with all

2367
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:14,880
the power it's brought

2368
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:17,040
has has brought an increase in

2369
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:17,920
complexity

2370
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:21,040
and i think that it's very fair to say

2371
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:21,440
that

2372
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:23,280
the security tools and the networking

2373
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:24,719
tools that we have to

2374
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:27,440
to manage and model and control access

2375
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:28,960
across all those environments

2376
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:32,639
has really lagged behind and has

2377
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:35,119
without a doubt given us a very

2378
01:46:35,119 --> 01:46:36,800
ineffective security platform we only

2379
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:37,760
need to look at

2380
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:40,719
the headlines and the terrible breaches

2381
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:41,119
and

2382
01:46:41,119 --> 01:46:42,480
incidents that are happening every

2383
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:44,320
single day because of a heightened

2384
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:45,840
threat landscape and the

2385
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:47,679
very advanced adversaries that we have

2386
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:48,880
out there uh

2387
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:50,560
to to reach the not too surprising

2388
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:52,560
conclusion that we really have to change

2389
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:53,280
things

2390
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:55,199
and change the way that we're doing

2391
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:57,040
security the reason

2392
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:59,199
uh my hypothesis is the reason that

2393
01:46:59,199 --> 01:47:00,320
we're in this state

2394
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:04,000
is really that um there's two

2395
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,920
there's two two things you know to some

2396
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:07,280
people we're fighting with one or maybe

2397
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:09,280
even both hands behind our back right

2398
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,920
and ultimately our networking technology

2399
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:12,880
tcpip

2400
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:15,679
as fantastic as it is uh is a weak

2401
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:17,280
security foundation if you look at the

2402
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:18,800
history of this when it was created in

2403
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:20,159
1970s

2404
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:21,840
the folks who did this where i have such

2405
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:23,440
amazing respect for

2406
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:27,520
what they created with such limited

2407
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,920
compute abilities uh they had to invent

2408
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:32,320
so much technology and standards along

2409
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,639
the way

2410
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,840
and the end result was that tcpib

2411
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:39,040
anticip

2412
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:41,119
is a phenomenally successful protocol

2413
01:47:41,119 --> 01:47:42,800
that's designed with this notion of

2414
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:44,480
complete implicit trust which is

2415
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:45,440
fantastic

2416
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:47,119
if you can send packets to a device

2417
01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:49,440
across the network tcp lets you very

2418
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:50,080
easily

2419
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:51,520
set up a network connection gives you

2420
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:52,880
some level of reliability for

2421
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:54,080
communications

2422
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:56,719
um and then you can conduct business by

2423
01:47:56,719 --> 01:47:58,719
communicating messages across that

2424
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:00,960
and the way it works of course is that

2425
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:02,639
it operates under this connect first and

2426
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:04,000
authenticate second protocol

2427
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,920
and everyone's familiar with tcp's

2428
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:07,520
three-way handshake

2429
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:09,360
to in order to establish a connection

2430
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:11,280
and the way it works is that number one

2431
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:13,280
you can really see everything on the

2432
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:14,880
network you can send an icmp

2433
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:17,040
ping and get a response back you can

2434
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:19,520
send a tcp send to it on an open port

2435
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:21,119
and you can get a response back and

2436
01:48:21,119 --> 01:48:23,920
that's giving you as a

2437
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:26,400
i.t or a networking professional some

2438
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:28,159
great tools to be able to

2439
01:48:28,159 --> 01:48:30,000
easily network your systems but it's

2440
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,760
also providing today far too much

2441
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:32,639
information

2442
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:35,840
and a very visible attack surface to our

2443
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:36,880
adversaries

2444
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:39,280
so the result today is that our

2445
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:41,199
adversaries can see all the resources on

2446
01:48:41,199 --> 01:48:42,400
our network either

2447
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,239
at the entry point to our enterprise

2448
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:45,600
networks if they're remote

2449
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,520
or across our enterprise networks if

2450
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:50,480
they've established a foothold inside

2451
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:51,760
then there's some level of connection

2452
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:53,520
establishment and then and only then is

2453
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:55,119
there some level of authentication that

2454
01:48:55,119 --> 01:48:56,320
happens

2455
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:58,320
typically at an application level and i

2456
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:59,440
know there's some things that are built

2457
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:01,920
on top of tcpip like 802 on x

2458
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:04,159
uh but at a basic networking level you

2459
01:49:04,159 --> 01:49:05,520
know this is definitely true and it's

2460
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,040
definitely a weakness

2461
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:09,840
so that's one that's one weakness and we

2462
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:10,800
can see this through

2463
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,800
our favorite search engine showdown

2464
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,400
where you can go out and look for things

2465
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:14,800
like

2466
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:16,560
the rdp protocol i did this the other

2467
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:18,400
day and there's approximately four and a

2468
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:19,920
half million rdp servers that it

2469
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:20,719
detected

2470
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:22,719
available worldwide and that number of

2471
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:24,080
course should be zero right

2472
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:27,119
for goodness sake don't do this don't

2473
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:29,280
expose rdp on your networks and

2474
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:30,800
don't expose for goodness sakes your

2475
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:33,199
windows login screen or

2476
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:36,000
even worse a windows server 2003 login

2477
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,880
screen that's publicly available

2478
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:42,719
so number one tcpip doesn't give us any

2479
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:44,480
notion of security because it's default

2480
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:46,639
uh implicit trust and default open

2481
01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:47,920
second is that

2482
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:51,040
tcpip and this is really

2483
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:53,360
even in today's most advanced cloud

2484
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:54,719
environments you look at infrastructure

2485
01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:56,239
as a service environments

2486
01:49:56,239 --> 01:49:58,159
the network security groups or the

2487
01:49:58,159 --> 01:50:00,400
security groups that they provide

2488
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:02,560
really have to fall back on this very

2489
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:03,679
impoverished

2490
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:05,760
policy language for expressing access

2491
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:06,880
control

2492
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:09,440
and that language is really just should

2493
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:10,000
this source

2494
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
ip address over here have access to this

2495
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,639
target ip address or subnet over here

2496
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:17,440
and it gives you the ability to say yes

2497
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:18,800
or no allow or block

2498
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:20,400
and the reality is that this is a

2499
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:22,159
terrible policy model because

2500
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:23,920
i p addresses aren't identities we know

2501
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:25,679
nothing about ip addresses

2502
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:28,400
they change they're shared and there's

2503
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:30,320
no context whatsoever to make this

2504
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:31,840
informed decision about

2505
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:35,280
whether or not this uh this uh source ip

2506
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:36,560
address should be allowed to connect to

2507
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:36,880
this

2508
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:40,480
and the end result of this is that um

2509
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:43,040
security teams often give up they say

2510
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:43,520
look

2511
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:45,920
i had no idea because i've got 5000

2512
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:47,119
users that are vpn

2513
01:50:47,119 --> 01:50:48,880
in and they all get the same amount of

2514
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,960
ip address or i've got

2515
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:53,440
5000 users on my internal network and

2516
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,800
they have dhcp

2517
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:56,320
and i don't really know who they are and

2518
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:57,920
as they go across the lan

2519
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:00,159
uh their ipa address gets anonymized and

2520
01:51:00,159 --> 01:51:01,840
i can't disambiguate anymore

2521
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:03,280
i'm going to give up and i have to

2522
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:04,560
support the business so we're just going

2523
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:06,320
to have a big open network maybe we'll

2524
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,239
have a couple of vlans like a production

2525
01:51:08,239 --> 01:51:09,599
and an employee vlan

2526
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:10,800
and we're going to rely on

2527
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:13,440
authentication for access control

2528
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:16,400
and the end result of that is terrible

2529
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:17,199
because

2530
01:51:17,199 --> 01:51:19,440
as we know authentication is not

2531
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:20,239
sufficient

2532
01:51:20,239 --> 01:51:22,000
for protecting our services and there

2533
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,480
are far too many exploits that are

2534
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:27,520
unpatched and well publicized

2535
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:29,440
for which authentication isn't even

2536
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:31,440
necessary all an attacker needs is the

2537
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:32,960
ability to send network packets to a

2538
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:34,080
target server

2539
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:36,159
they can exploit some vulnerability and

2540
01:51:36,159 --> 01:51:37,840
then they're uh they're into the network

2541
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:38,239
and they're

2542
01:51:38,239 --> 01:51:40,159
they're on their way so the solution to

2543
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:42,320
this is this concept of zero trust

2544
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:45,520
and zero trust as a philosophy

2545
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:47,679
has some principles in mind and what the

2546
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:49,360
goals of this are number one

2547
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:51,520
is to compensate for the weaknesses of

2548
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,080
our the inherent weaknesses of our

2549
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:55,920
implicit trust network and what zero

2550
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:57,119
trust says is no

2551
01:51:57,119 --> 01:51:59,760
we're gonna require uh some level of

2552
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:01,679
authentication first before

2553
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:03,119
you're actually allowed to establish a

2554
01:52:03,119 --> 01:52:05,040
network connection and we do this by

2555
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:06,560
reversing this by turning this

2556
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:08,480
this uh this process on its head and

2557
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:09,840
saying

2558
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,840
systems have to authenticate and there's

2559
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:12,960
a variety of means that they can

2560
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:14,560
authenticate we'll talk about that

2561
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:16,800
a little bit later but only after

2562
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:18,320
they've authenticated are they actually

2563
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:19,520
allowed to establish a network

2564
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:20,239
connection

2565
01:52:20,239 --> 01:52:23,679
and then of course there can only see

2566
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:25,840
the set of resources that are authorized

2567
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:27,360
for them so what this implies is

2568
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:28,639
of course there's some sort of identity

2569
01:52:28,639 --> 01:52:30,800
system and mechanism for authenticating

2570
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:32,560
these individuals or these identities

2571
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:35,360
if they're non-humans and then two

2572
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:36,560
there's a policy model or an

2573
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:38,480
authorization model that says

2574
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:40,320
given what we know about this identity

2575
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:41,599
here are the set of resources that

2576
01:52:41,599 --> 01:52:42,960
they're allowed to access

2577
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:45,199
at this point in time now the beauty of

2578
01:52:45,199 --> 01:52:46,480
this system is that

2579
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:49,119
it also makes the system resilient to

2580
01:52:49,119 --> 01:52:50,880
denial of service attacks because if you

2581
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,080
think about this

2582
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:54,320
that if it's done properly the mechanism

2583
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:55,679
the computational load for

2584
01:52:55,679 --> 01:52:57,760
authenticating these identities is going

2585
01:52:57,760 --> 01:52:59,040
to be far far

2586
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:02,480
less than the the work

2587
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:04,880
and the computational load necessary to

2588
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:06,800
actually establish a tcp or tls

2589
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:07,520
connection

2590
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:09,040
and then perform some level of

2591
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:10,800
application authentication

2592
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:12,080
so it makes the networks much more

2593
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:14,400
resilient assuming that you do it right

2594
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:16,000
so that's the first piece of this the

2595
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,080
second piece of it is

2596
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:20,320
that xero trust enables a much richer

2597
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:21,199
and i would argue

2598
01:53:21,199 --> 01:53:23,760
far far more useful policy language for

2599
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:25,119
expressing

2600
01:53:25,119 --> 01:53:27,199
authorization and the policy language

2601
01:53:27,199 --> 01:53:28,960
that azir trust system

2602
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:30,960
presents to us is the ability to ask a

2603
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:32,000
question like this

2604
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,520
well should jim have access to our

2605
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:35,119
production sap server

2606
01:53:35,119 --> 01:53:36,719
okay that's a really interesting

2607
01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:38,480
question and it's actually meaningful

2608
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:41,599
to a lot of people across the business

2609
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:43,679
we know jim jim has an identity jim has

2610
01:53:43,679 --> 01:53:45,440
a role in the company

2611
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:47,679
and maybe jim just shoot or shouldn't

2612
01:53:47,679 --> 01:53:49,440
have access to the production server but

2613
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:50,880
we're not talking about an ip address

2614
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:52,719
here so that's a meaningful question

2615
01:53:52,719 --> 01:53:54,800
and the other half of it is this is our

2616
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:56,239
sap production server

2617
01:53:56,239 --> 01:53:58,239
so now we know okay this is production

2618
01:53:58,239 --> 01:54:00,239
data it's probably got to be protected

2619
01:54:00,239 --> 01:54:01,599
maybe it should only be accessible to

2620
01:54:01,599 --> 01:54:04,639
people on the finance team etc

2621
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:06,960
that's a really meaningful question that

2622
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:08,320
you can build some interesting sets of

2623
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:10,000
policies and controls around

2624
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,840
second the answer to the question that

2625
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,760
zero trust enables is in fact

2626
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:16,560
it depends and that's of course always

2627
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:18,159
always the right answer to any

2628
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:19,440
interesting question

2629
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:21,440
and what does it depend on well it

2630
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:23,199
depends on a lot of really

2631
01:54:23,199 --> 01:54:25,760
interesting uh additional elements and

2632
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:27,840
these are exactly the ingredients if you

2633
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:28,320
will

2634
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,239
that zero trust enables in a policy

2635
01:54:30,239 --> 01:54:32,080
model so now imagine

2636
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:34,719
a world where you can say fantastic i

2637
01:54:34,719 --> 01:54:36,159
know that this is a production system

2638
01:54:36,159 --> 01:54:38,960
i'm going to set up a policy that says

2639
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:40,960
in order to access the user interface to

2640
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:42,080
use our our

2641
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:44,159
financial system this person needs to be

2642
01:54:44,159 --> 01:54:45,760
on the finance team and our group

2643
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:47,199
and our directory system they need to

2644
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:49,199
authenticate if the remote they need to

2645
01:54:49,199 --> 01:54:50,000
use mfa

2646
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,239
if they're local maybe that they don't

2647
01:54:52,239 --> 01:54:53,119
um

2648
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:55,280
they need to make sure that their system

2649
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:56,320
their local device

2650
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:58,159
is patched and up-to-date according to

2651
01:54:58,159 --> 01:54:59,599
our database um

2652
01:54:59,599 --> 01:55:02,320
maybe it's the type of job or function

2653
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:03,040
where

2654
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,480
we really only want them to connect

2655
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:06,719
during typical business hours

2656
01:55:06,719 --> 01:55:09,119
these are all really useful ingredients

2657
01:55:09,119 --> 01:55:09,760
to have

2658
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:12,639
in a policy that are impossible to

2659
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:14,639
express with traditional networking

2660
01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:17,360
technologies so those are kind of the

2661
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:18,800
ingredients of where we where we want to

2662
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:19,520
get to

2663
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:22,239
so we think about what zero trust is so

2664
01:55:22,239 --> 01:55:23,119
juris trust

2665
01:55:23,119 --> 01:55:26,159
is a security philosophy that's happened

2666
01:55:26,159 --> 01:55:28,320
in the market in the last five to seven

2667
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:28,800
years

2668
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:31,360
and in the last year it's really taken

2669
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:32,239
significant

2670
01:55:32,239 --> 01:55:35,199
uh prominence and visibility in the

2671
01:55:35,199 --> 01:55:36,400
market which is great

2672
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:38,080
there's a downside which is also become

2673
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:40,159
a buzzword and there's a lot of vendor

2674
01:55:40,159 --> 01:55:41,199
hype around that

2675
01:55:41,199 --> 01:55:42,719
um but ultimately there's some real

2676
01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:44,320
substance behind this and if we think

2677
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:45,040
about

2678
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:46,639
what the united states national

2679
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:48,239
institute

2680
01:55:48,239 --> 01:55:50,560
of standards and technology or nist says

2681
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:52,719
is that this is a set of cyber security

2682
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:55,440
paradigms that move defenses from

2683
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:58,639
our traditional static and network-based

2684
01:55:58,639 --> 01:55:59,840
perimeters or i would say

2685
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:02,080
perimeter-based networks

2686
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:04,639
and instead focus on users assets and

2687
01:56:04,639 --> 01:56:06,960
resources a really identity-centric

2688
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:09,040
uh identity cen an identity-centric

2689
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:10,800
model and those identities of course can

2690
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,000
be humans as well as

2691
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,360
non-person entities a couple weeks ago

2692
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:17,040
president biden of the u.s issued an

2693
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:20,320
executive order around

2694
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:22,880
a prioritization and investment in

2695
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:24,639
federal agencies around cyber security

2696
01:56:24,639 --> 01:56:26,080
and one element of this was

2697
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:29,199
mandating zero trust and in this in this

2698
01:56:29,199 --> 01:56:30,880
order they define zero trust

2699
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:33,199
as something that eliminates implicit

2700
01:56:33,199 --> 01:56:35,920
trust in any one element mode or service

2701
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:37,520
and instead requires continuous

2702
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:40,320
verification and that's important

2703
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,000
the operational picture via real-time

2704
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,920
information from multiple sources

2705
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:45,520
to determine access and other system

2706
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:47,119
responses so the key elements of this

2707
01:56:47,119 --> 01:56:49,440
are continuous as opposed to static

2708
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:51,040
and the fact that this thing is

2709
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:53,440
synthesizing information from a variety

2710
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:54,719
of sources and we'll see that in the

2711
01:56:54,719 --> 01:56:57,280
next on the next slide with the diagram

2712
01:56:57,280 --> 01:56:58,800
ultimately if you look at what nist is

2713
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:01,280
saying is uh they list a number of

2714
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:03,920
of tenants in their in their document uh

2715
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:05,040
which is very

2716
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:07,040
highly readable i recommend it but the

2717
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:08,400
core elements of our

2718
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:09,840
of these are these four bullet points

2719
01:57:09,840 --> 01:57:11,440
here which are first that

2720
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:13,440
all communications is secured regardless

2721
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:15,199
of network location and that's not just

2722
01:57:15,199 --> 01:57:17,599
data in motion terms encryption but

2723
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:19,199
ensuring that there's a model

2724
01:57:19,199 --> 01:57:22,000
around uh controlling access for all

2725
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,360
identities all users

2726
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,440
to all resources regardless of where the

2727
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:26,719
user is

2728
01:57:26,719 --> 01:57:28,000
regardless of what network they're

2729
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
communicating over and regardless of

2730
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,159
where the workload is operating

2731
01:57:32,159 --> 01:57:35,040
second that there is a dynamic policy

2732
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:36,320
model

2733
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:38,239
that is enforced that enforces

2734
01:57:38,239 --> 01:57:40,480
authorization um and dynamic is an

2735
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:41,520
important piece of it

2736
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:42,960
uh because you get to the third bullet

2737
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:44,719
point and they talk about how all

2738
01:57:44,719 --> 01:57:47,280
authentication and authorization is

2739
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:48,080
dynamic

2740
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:50,080
and strictly enforced before access is

2741
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:51,199
allowed so this is the principle of

2742
01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:52,639
least privilege

2743
01:57:52,639 --> 01:57:54,800
which harkens back to the let's make

2744
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:57,199
sure that all unauthorized resources are

2745
01:57:57,199 --> 01:58:00,480
invisible on the network

2746
01:58:01,119 --> 01:58:03,360
and then finally there needs to be some

2747
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:04,159
monitoring

2748
01:58:04,159 --> 01:58:06,159
some enrich capabilities to look at

2749
01:58:06,159 --> 01:58:07,599
what's happening on the network

2750
01:58:07,599 --> 01:58:10,960
and the ability to dive into and look at

2751
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:14,560
the security posture of the assets

2752
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:18,880
zero trust is not an architecture it's a

2753
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:20,400
approach and philosophy and these type

2754
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:22,480
of principles and it maps to a variety

2755
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:23,840
of architectural

2756
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:26,880
uh implementations

2757
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:28,560
so let's take a look at uh at some of

2758
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:30,800
those so this document shows

2759
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:32,880
at a high level the concepts of zero

2760
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:35,040
trust from the nist document you can see

2761
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:36,560
there's some key elements here so the

2762
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:38,719
first is there's this thing at the top

2763
01:58:38,719 --> 01:58:41,599
called the policy decision point or pdp

2764
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:43,119
and that's the brain if you will and

2765
01:58:43,119 --> 01:58:44,960
that communicates with a set of policy

2766
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:46,719
enforcement points through a control

2767
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:47,360
plane

2768
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:49,040
so the first of all is very classic

2769
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:50,400
separation of the control plane in the

2770
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:51,840
data plane that we've seen across other

2771
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:52,560
industry

2772
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:56,320
paradigms second is that the subject

2773
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:58,159
which utilizes some computer system of

2774
01:58:58,159 --> 01:59:00,800
course can only access the enterprise

2775
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,320
resource by going through

2776
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:04,400
a policy enforcement point the policy

2777
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:05,599
enforcement point

2778
01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:09,360
is the one that like its name implies

2779
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:11,199
enforces the policies that are given to

2780
01:59:11,199 --> 01:59:13,599
it by the policy decision point

2781
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:14,960
and there's also some authentication

2782
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:16,800
that has to happen for the subject and

2783
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:17,119
i'll

2784
01:59:17,119 --> 01:59:19,199
i'll illustrate that in the next slide

2785
01:59:19,199 --> 01:59:20,159
the boxes on the

2786
01:59:20,159 --> 01:59:22,000
on either side of the diagram are really

2787
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,440
really important those are shown as

2788
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:24,639
logical inputs

2789
01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:26,719
into the zero truss system and you can

2790
01:59:26,719 --> 01:59:28,320
imagine there's eight there but that's

2791
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:29,360
just a sample

2792
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:31,199
a complete enumeration of the rest of

2793
01:59:31,199 --> 01:59:32,320
the elements of your enterprise

2794
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:33,119
ecosystem

2795
01:59:33,119 --> 01:59:35,520
i mean clearly a policy decision point

2796
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:37,360
in order to make identity and contact

2797
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:38,080
sensitive

2798
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:40,080
decisions about should this subject to

2799
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:41,440
this identity have access to this

2800
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:42,800
resource over here

2801
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:45,119
needs to look at the identity management

2802
01:59:45,119 --> 01:59:46,960
system or the pki system

2803
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:48,719
if they're looking at that probably

2804
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:50,320
understanding what's going on in the

2805
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:51,840
environment by getting information from

2806
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:52,719
a sin

2807
01:59:52,719 --> 01:59:54,400
probably getting some information from a

2808
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:56,320
threat intelligence system

2809
01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:58,239
certainly a continuous diagnostics and

2810
01:59:58,239 --> 01:59:59,440
monitoring system

2811
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:01,679
uh probably also a cmdb to get some

2812
02:00:01,679 --> 02:00:02,800
visibility into this

2813
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:05,440
so all these things become input into

2814
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:06,239
the

2815
02:00:06,239 --> 02:00:08,239
uh the policy decision point so we can

2816
02:00:08,239 --> 02:00:10,239
then make continuous decisions about

2817
02:00:10,239 --> 02:00:12,000
should this resource get access to the

2818
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
system over here to begin with

2819
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,520
and if something changes in the

2820
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:17,199
environment

2821
02:00:17,199 --> 02:00:18,800
maybe we need to revoke that access or

2822
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:20,159
maybe we need to enforce step-up

2823
02:00:20,159 --> 02:00:22,960
authentication for the user

2824
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:25,760
so if we look at um the nist document

2825
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:27,840
outlines actually for deployment models

2826
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:29,199
and we're just going to focus on one

2827
02:00:29,199 --> 02:00:30,000
today

2828
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,440
in the interest of time and this one is

2829
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:33,440
called the enclave based deployment

2830
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:34,880
model

2831
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:36,960
this also happens to be the model that

2832
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:38,320
seems to have

2833
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:41,599
i would say have the predominant or very

2834
02:00:41,599 --> 02:00:42,400
common

2835
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:45,840
uh usage or a support in uh

2836
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:46,800
open source and commercial

2837
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:48,239
implementations in the marketplace in

2838
02:00:48,239 --> 02:00:49,599
particular around the software defined

2839
02:00:49,599 --> 02:00:50,639
perimeter and the idea

2840
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:54,159
is that you've got a usually an agent a

2841
02:00:54,159 --> 02:00:55,840
local policy enforcement point that runs

2842
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:57,199
on the user's device

2843
02:00:57,199 --> 02:00:59,199
you have a policy enforcement point that

2844
02:00:59,199 --> 02:01:01,040
acts as a network gateway and sits in

2845
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:01,679
front of

2846
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:04,719
the protected resources

2847
02:01:04,719 --> 02:01:06,239
both those systems will integrate with

2848
02:01:06,239 --> 02:01:08,400
and talk to the policy decision point

2849
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:11,280
uh to for the subject's case to

2850
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:13,040
authenticate the user and for the

2851
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:16,000
uh for the the pep's case to get

2852
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:17,920
information about uh what policies are

2853
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:18,480
allowed

2854
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:21,119
and to uh to be in constant touch for

2855
02:01:21,119 --> 02:01:22,639
time changes

2856
02:01:22,639 --> 02:01:24,159
and then the communication goes from the

2857
02:01:24,159 --> 02:01:25,840
subject's device across some sort of

2858
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:26,560
secure

2859
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:28,560
logical channel through the policy

2860
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:30,960
enforcement point to the target resource

2861
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:32,719
that sits in some resource enclave and

2862
02:01:32,719 --> 02:01:34,239
the beauty of this is that

2863
02:01:34,239 --> 02:01:37,440
because the pep is managing the traffic

2864
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:39,360
it has the ability to of course block it

2865
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:41,280
uh it has the ability to influence and

2866
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:43,199
affect change on the user's device such

2867
02:01:43,199 --> 02:01:43,520
as

2868
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:45,920
prompting for step-up authentication and

2869
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:47,599
it has the ability to interrogate the

2870
02:01:47,599 --> 02:01:49,119
target resource environment

2871
02:01:49,119 --> 02:01:51,520
for changes such as hey a new resource

2872
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:53,280
has appeared with these attributes

2873
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:55,119
so we're going to allow or disallow

2874
02:01:55,119 --> 02:01:56,320
access based on

2875
02:01:56,320 --> 02:01:59,440
based on the attributes okay

2876
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:02,159
so i'm going to very briefly give you a

2877
02:02:02,159 --> 02:02:03,040
an example

2878
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:04,719
of this and then we'll shift gears and

2879
02:02:04,719 --> 02:02:06,159
talk about this from an incident

2880
02:02:06,159 --> 02:02:08,000
response perspective

2881
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,520
so imagine we have an enterprise that

2882
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:11,679
has deployed a zero trust model

2883
02:02:11,679 --> 02:02:13,119
and has the attributes that we've talked

2884
02:02:13,119 --> 02:02:14,880
about and we'll start with our favorite

2885
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:16,239
employee sally

2886
02:02:16,239 --> 02:02:18,960
who is director of finance um so she

2887
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:19,920
wakes up in the morning

2888
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:22,239
and gets her first cup of coffee or tea

2889
02:02:22,239 --> 02:02:23,040
and uh

2890
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:24,880
turns on her device and starts to do her

2891
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:27,199
work and the first thing that happens is

2892
02:02:27,199 --> 02:02:29,040
the device validates the zero trust

2893
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:30,880
agent on the device validates that

2894
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:34,080
hey this device has a properly uh proper

2895
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:36,000
certificate that was issued by

2896
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,040
the corporate ca that's in let's say

2897
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:40,880
some sort of hardware hardware security

2898
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:43,040
module

2899
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:45,119
based on that the zero trust system says

2900
02:02:45,119 --> 02:02:46,560
okay now we're ready to connect to the

2901
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:48,560
network and it allows sally to access

2902
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:51,760
um cloud-based email uh but because

2903
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:53,520
she's not in an office building

2904
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:54,880
it's gonna prompt her for some sort of

2905
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:56,639
multi-factor authentication

2906
02:02:56,639 --> 02:02:58,480
and sally doesn't mind because it just

2907
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:01,280
does something modern like pushes a

2908
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:03,520
pushes a notification to her phone and

2909
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:05,599
she presses yes on an authenticator app

2910
02:03:05,599 --> 02:03:06,560
of some sort

2911
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:09,119
um she also has secure access into some

2912
02:03:09,119 --> 02:03:11,119
on-premises resources in this case

2913
02:03:11,119 --> 02:03:12,960
uh file share so she downloads a

2914
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:14,719
presentation that she needs to look at

2915
02:03:14,719 --> 02:03:16,080
for today

2916
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:18,400
but shelly makes a mistake clicks on a

2917
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:19,679
phishing link in email

2918
02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:21,520
and gets a malware installed on her

2919
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:23,520
device

2920
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:25,760
after that she goes to the office uh

2921
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:27,040
plugs into the network

2922
02:03:27,040 --> 02:03:31,119
there or gets on the corporate wi-fi and

2923
02:03:31,119 --> 02:03:32,880
again does her job what happens is the

2924
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:34,719
zero trust system would recognize that

2925
02:03:34,719 --> 02:03:36,239
she has roamed now she's on a different

2926
02:03:36,239 --> 02:03:37,840
network it goes through

2927
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:39,199
some further validation behind the

2928
02:03:39,199 --> 02:03:41,119
scenes for her but says okay

2929
02:03:41,119 --> 02:03:43,119
everything's still good with the device

2930
02:03:43,119 --> 02:03:44,320
we're on the corporate network

2931
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:45,840
she can access these department

2932
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:47,679
applications and do her job

2933
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:49,199
but what happens is the malware also

2934
02:03:49,199 --> 02:03:50,880
wakes up and the malware attempts to do

2935
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:52,079
some port scans

2936
02:03:52,079 --> 02:03:54,239
across the network and because this is a

2937
02:03:54,239 --> 02:03:55,679
zero trust system

2938
02:03:55,679 --> 02:03:57,199
and because everything operates in the

2939
02:03:57,199 --> 02:03:58,960
default deny mode first of all those

2940
02:03:58,960 --> 02:03:59,679
port scans

2941
02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:02,560
are blocked and second of all they are

2942
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:04,159
they are detected very easily

2943
02:04:04,159 --> 02:04:05,679
because there's much less noise in the

2944
02:04:05,679 --> 02:04:08,159
system so the security system says hey

2945
02:04:08,159 --> 02:04:10,960
this is unauthorized it notifies i.t it

2946
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:12,320
notifies the sock

2947
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:15,280
and it can also either in an automated

2948
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:17,440
fashion or a manual fashion

2949
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:20,239
um quarantine her device and says okay

2950
02:04:20,239 --> 02:04:21,599
something is up here this thing is

2951
02:04:21,599 --> 02:04:23,199
attempting to do things that sally never

2952
02:04:23,199 --> 02:04:23,760
does

2953
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:25,280
we're going to block it from the network

2954
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:27,040
maybe we'll send sally a text message or

2955
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:28,320
call her up

2956
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:30,800
and prevent the malware from spreading

2957
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:32,880
on the network

2958
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:36,400
and finally let's say the

2959
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:38,480
security team has said okay we need to

2960
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:39,840
have uh

2961
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:41,599
our i.t administrator connect to

2962
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:43,119
satellite's device to

2963
02:04:43,119 --> 02:04:45,199
uh to remove the malware or to re-image

2964
02:04:45,199 --> 02:04:47,199
it or whatever

2965
02:04:47,199 --> 02:04:48,560
in this case what they're doing is

2966
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:50,000
they're utilizing the capability of a

2967
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,599
zero trust system to integrate with the

2968
02:04:51,599 --> 02:04:52,079
business

2969
02:04:52,079 --> 02:04:54,159
process in this case the service desk so

2970
02:04:54,159 --> 02:04:55,679
they follow their normal process of

2971
02:04:55,679 --> 02:04:58,560
creating the service desk ticket

2972
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:00,880
the it administrator because there's an

2973
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:02,560
open ticket now has the ability to

2974
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:04,159
establish this network connection to

2975
02:05:04,159 --> 02:05:05,440
sally's device

2976
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:08,560
and what the beauty of this is that bob

2977
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:10,560
who could possibly have malware in his

2978
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:11,760
device as well

2979
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:14,480
doesn't have unlimited 24x7 access to

2980
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:15,599
everyone's device it's

2981
02:05:15,599 --> 02:05:18,000
only controlled it's only allowed if

2982
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,360
there's a service test ticket that's in

2983
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:20,960
the open state and the service desk

2984
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:21,679
ticket

2985
02:05:21,679 --> 02:05:23,760
is another ingredient into the zero

2986
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:26,560
trust systems policy decision point

2987
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:28,400
because that ticket is open bob can

2988
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:29,599
actually establish the connection to

2989
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:30,639
sally's device

2990
02:05:30,639 --> 02:05:32,159
he logs in he does what he needs to do

2991
02:05:32,159 --> 02:05:33,599
to clean it up and then he closes the

2992
02:05:33,599 --> 02:05:35,119
ticket

2993
02:05:35,119 --> 02:05:37,280
and then bob's ability to connect goes

2994
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:39,280
away once the ticket is closed and the

2995
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:40,400
security system

2996
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:42,880
has basically been reset and says okay

2997
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:44,639
sally's device is now clean

2998
02:05:44,639 --> 02:05:46,639
then she can reestablish the connection

2999
02:05:46,639 --> 02:05:48,480
she'll probably be prompted for mfa and

3000
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:50,560
then she can be fully productive again

3001
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:52,159
very simple example but it shows some of

3002
02:05:52,159 --> 02:05:53,599
the flows here and

3003
02:05:53,599 --> 02:05:56,000
the capabilities so let's look at this

3004
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:56,639
from an ir

3005
02:05:56,639 --> 02:05:58,880
perspective clearly everyone on the call

3006
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:00,159
here is familiar with these

3007
02:06:00,159 --> 02:06:02,560
uh with these six phases um what we're

3008
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:03,760
going to do is walk through each of

3009
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:06,400
these and try to look at it from

3010
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:09,280
how a zero trust enterprise would have a

3011
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:10,239
different

3012
02:06:10,239 --> 02:06:11,840
perspective or different experience or a

3013
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:14,400
different set of capabilities for this

3014
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:17,199
our premise here is that the enterprise

3015
02:06:17,199 --> 02:06:18,639
has some sort of zero trust system

3016
02:06:18,639 --> 02:06:20,159
deployed and we can assume it uses a

3017
02:06:20,159 --> 02:06:21,280
model very similar

3018
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:23,280
to what we talked about in uh this

3019
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:24,960
enclave based model

3020
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:27,840
that they've got it working in whoops

3021
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:30,079
reasonably good operational form

3022
02:06:30,079 --> 02:06:32,560
they have good authentication methods

3023
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:35,119
and well-understood identity providers

3024
02:06:35,119 --> 02:06:37,119
they have multi-factor authentication in

3025
02:06:37,119 --> 02:06:38,400
place for

3026
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:40,079
hopefully all users but at least most

3027
02:06:40,079 --> 02:06:41,679
users

3028
02:06:41,679 --> 02:06:43,599
and they have some level of integration

3029
02:06:43,599 --> 02:06:45,199
automated integration between the zero

3030
02:06:45,199 --> 02:06:45,840
trust and

3031
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:48,079
infrastructure and their security and

3032
02:06:48,079 --> 02:06:49,679
i.t systems so

3033
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:51,599
feeding information that's enriched up

3034
02:06:51,599 --> 02:06:53,119
to the sim for example

3035
02:06:53,119 --> 02:06:54,719
and the ability to respond to events

3036
02:06:54,719 --> 02:06:56,480
from a sock and

3037
02:06:56,480 --> 02:06:58,159
tie into maybe a service test like we

3038
02:06:58,159 --> 02:06:59,679
mentioned um

3039
02:06:59,679 --> 02:07:02,639
so let's let's take a look so in the

3040
02:07:02,639 --> 02:07:03,119
prepare

3041
02:07:03,119 --> 02:07:05,119
phase i think you know clearly there's

3042
02:07:05,119 --> 02:07:06,800
some basic steps that

3043
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:09,760
ir folks all do uh showed on on the left

3044
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:10,719
side and in

3045
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:12,320
a zero trust world what we would

3046
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:14,159
recommend is looking at a zero trust

3047
02:07:14,159 --> 02:07:15,840
appointment from an ir

3048
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:18,800
perspective is first of all make sure

3049
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:20,239
that you have

3050
02:07:20,239 --> 02:07:21,599
policy enforcement points that are

3051
02:07:21,599 --> 02:07:23,920
distributed across the network to get

3052
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:27,119
those trust zones as small as possible

3053
02:07:27,119 --> 02:07:28,560
so if you go back for a second

3054
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:30,159
the idea here is you have this resource

3055
02:07:30,159 --> 02:07:32,560
enclave so try to have that as small as

3056
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:34,000
possible so there is little

3057
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,079
there's as little as possible

3058
02:07:36,079 --> 02:07:38,079
communication between these resources

3059
02:07:38,079 --> 02:07:38,480
here

3060
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:41,040
that's outside the view of the policy

3061
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:43,760
enforcement point

3062
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:45,440
this is often referred to as micro

3063
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:46,960
segmentation for example

3064
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:48,480
um you definitely want to have

3065
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:50,079
mechanisms to have

3066
02:07:50,079 --> 02:07:52,719
either uh either manually or ideally

3067
02:07:52,719 --> 02:07:53,440
automated

3068
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:55,199
for enforcing step-up authentication

3069
02:07:55,199 --> 02:07:57,119
when various things happen such as

3070
02:07:57,119 --> 02:07:58,719
when someone's accessing a particular

3071
02:07:58,719 --> 02:08:00,639
high-value resource or

3072
02:08:00,639 --> 02:08:04,400
when maybe an a indication of compromise

3073
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:05,920
or something happens where

3074
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:07,520
something's out of the ordinary so that

3075
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:09,040
the system can very easily and

3076
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:09,840
automatically

3077
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:12,000
enforce step up authentication for a

3078
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,679
given user or for

3079
02:08:13,679 --> 02:08:15,440
a group of users who might be accessing

3080
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:17,679
a particular resource

3081
02:08:17,679 --> 02:08:18,880
we definitely want to have some device

3082
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:20,880
posture checks that become

3083
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:23,040
additional input into the zero trust

3084
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:25,360
policy decision point

3085
02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:28,480
and you have the ability to

3086
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:32,159
define network access based on different

3087
02:08:32,159 --> 02:08:34,159
types of devices

3088
02:08:34,159 --> 02:08:37,199
such as for example only allowing mobile

3089
02:08:37,199 --> 02:08:39,280
operating system devices to access some

3090
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:40,560
types of resources but not

3091
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:42,560
others you definitely want to have

3092
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:44,079
integrations with an endpoint management

3093
02:08:44,079 --> 02:08:46,000
systems and sim in the sock those are

3094
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:46,400
also

3095
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:48,480
great inputs into the xero trust policy

3096
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:50,400
model either from

3097
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:53,040
a device attribute perspective for let's

3098
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:54,239
say the endpoint system

3099
02:08:54,239 --> 02:08:57,360
or from an event perspective and then

3100
02:08:57,360 --> 02:08:58,079
you want to have

3101
02:08:58,079 --> 02:09:00,719
some instrumentation in place so that

3102
02:09:00,719 --> 02:09:02,480
the zero trust agents and the policy

3103
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:04,239
enforcement points could also be feeding

3104
02:09:04,239 --> 02:09:04,880
information

3105
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:09,199
up to a sim or a monitoring system

3106
02:09:09,199 --> 02:09:11,360
okay so that's definitely good practice

3107
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:12,239
to prepare

3108
02:09:12,239 --> 02:09:15,119
uh from a zero trust perspective if you

3109
02:09:15,119 --> 02:09:16,000
look at

3110
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:19,760
when uh or in the identify phase

3111
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:21,199
zero trust as we mentioned because it

3112
02:09:21,199 --> 02:09:23,440
operates in a default and high mode

3113
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:24,639
dramatically improves the

3114
02:09:24,639 --> 02:09:26,480
signal-to-noise ratio

3115
02:09:26,480 --> 02:09:29,679
so in theory quote-unquote all access

3116
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:31,920
should only be allowed uh should only be

3117
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:32,719
occurring

3118
02:09:32,719 --> 02:09:36,000
for authorized resources that have

3119
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,920
policies that are evaluated positively

3120
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:39,520
and assigned to a user

3121
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:41,199
now that often tends to be a little bit

3122
02:09:41,199 --> 02:09:43,199
more of an end state because

3123
02:09:43,199 --> 02:09:44,880
in many cases organizations don't want

3124
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:46,480
to lock everything down

3125
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:49,440
but it's definitely going to block

3126
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:51,599
significant chunks of access such as

3127
02:09:51,599 --> 02:09:53,679
someone in the finance team should never

3128
02:09:53,679 --> 02:09:55,360
be allowed to ssh to anything

3129
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:56,880
that's simply you know not in their job

3130
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:58,719
description it's not in their skill set

3131
02:09:58,719 --> 02:10:01,040
and there's no reason whatsoever not to

3132
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:01,920
block all

3133
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:04,320
ssh access attempts from people on the

3134
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:06,079
finance team

3135
02:10:06,079 --> 02:10:08,560
likewise you should have very strict

3136
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:10,159
control around who's allowed to access

3137
02:10:10,159 --> 02:10:12,320
any production servers

3138
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:14,079
the xerotrust system also provides

3139
02:10:14,079 --> 02:10:16,159
identity enriched log and activity data

3140
02:10:16,159 --> 02:10:17,280
and this is a real

3141
02:10:17,280 --> 02:10:18,800
challenge in many cases when you have

3142
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:20,800
complex wide area networks with lots of

3143
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:21,280
network

3144
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:23,360
address translation or you have people

3145
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:25,679
vpning in and there's oftentimes

3146
02:10:25,679 --> 02:10:27,840
a difficult it's difficult or impossible

3147
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:28,800
for a sim

3148
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:31,760
to disambiguate activity on the network

3149
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:33,599
from ip addresses and because you have

3150
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:34,719
these

3151
02:10:34,719 --> 02:10:36,400
in a zero trust world these policy

3152
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:38,800
enforcement points across the network

3153
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:40,560
they know exactly which identity is

3154
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:42,079
doing what and that information

3155
02:10:42,079 --> 02:10:45,840
can be fed into a sim to make analysis

3156
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:49,599
and sock uh sock analyst work a lot

3157
02:10:49,599 --> 02:10:51,440
easier

3158
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:53,599
the zero trust environment because it

3159
02:10:53,599 --> 02:10:55,040
operates as an overlay across the

3160
02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:56,000
network

3161
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,920
gives teams the ability to find a single

3162
02:10:57,920 --> 02:10:59,760
unified access control model

3163
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:01,119
across all those environments and it

3164
02:11:01,119 --> 02:11:02,719
really eliminates the difficulties of

3165
02:11:02,719 --> 02:11:03,520
having

3166
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:06,800
siloed access control lists and

3167
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:10,079
models for a knack versus a vpn versus

3168
02:11:10,079 --> 02:11:11,920
a cloud environment versus a virtualized

3169
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:14,400
environment and that significantly helps

3170
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:15,840
improve the efficiency and the

3171
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:17,520
effectiveness of people's

3172
02:11:17,520 --> 02:11:19,199
understanding of what's going on in

3173
02:11:19,199 --> 02:11:20,480
these environments people don't have to

3174
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:21,199
say okay

3175
02:11:21,199 --> 02:11:22,800
well why is this thing accessing that

3176
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:24,400
well i don't know let's go check the acl

3177
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:25,280
for that system

3178
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:26,960
well who knows that you know it's george

3179
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:29,280
well he's on vacation this week instead

3180
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:30,880
everything's in one environment so it's

3181
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:33,840
very much easier to find this stuff

3182
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:35,520
in addition in the zero trust

3183
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:37,280
environment in most situations you have

3184
02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:38,239
an on-device

3185
02:11:38,239 --> 02:11:40,159
agent running on the user's device and

3186
02:11:40,159 --> 02:11:41,679
that can be used to provide additional

3187
02:11:41,679 --> 02:11:42,560
telemetry

3188
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:44,480
in some cases it can perform activities

3189
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:45,599
you can often

3190
02:11:45,599 --> 02:11:48,560
download custom scripts to that etc with

3191
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:50,000
of course the caveat that

3192
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,280
if you're making an assumption that that

3193
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:53,040
device compromised

3194
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:54,400
you know you don't know exactly what's

3195
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:55,760
going on the device and maybe you take

3196
02:11:55,760 --> 02:11:57,360
it with a little bit of grain of salt

3197
02:11:57,360 --> 02:11:58,560
but it's certainly better than not

3198
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:00,719
having it

3199
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:02,960
in a contained model a contain phase

3200
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:04,400
zero trust is great at this because

3201
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:05,280
clearly

3202
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:08,079
it has the ability to control exactly

3203
02:12:08,079 --> 02:12:09,360
what access is happening

3204
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:11,679
on the network both in mail and outbound

3205
02:12:11,679 --> 02:12:13,520
um so it's very easy to isolate these

3206
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:14,880
devices

3207
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:16,800
in many xero trust systems you can

3208
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:18,239
literally say all right i want to have

3209
02:12:18,239 --> 02:12:18,639
this

3210
02:12:18,639 --> 02:12:20,320
device and i'm going to block all

3211
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:21,920
network traffic to and from it

3212
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:23,440
and the only thing that can communicate

3213
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:26,000
is now across that control plane

3214
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,440
you can also do things that are a little

3215
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:29,840
bit more subtle like

3216
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:32,400
enforce step up authentication or

3217
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:33,920
enforce multiple factors of

3218
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:34,880
authentication

3219
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:36,880
which is great to do in out-of-band mode

3220
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:38,239
so certainly

3221
02:12:38,239 --> 02:12:40,079
if you consume consider that a device

3222
02:12:40,079 --> 02:12:41,280
might be um

3223
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:43,599
compromised you could easily say okay

3224
02:12:43,599 --> 02:12:44,480
great

3225
02:12:44,480 --> 02:12:45,360
we're not going to have the user

3226
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:46,800
re-enter a password because there might

3227
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:48,480
be a key logger but we're going to push

3228
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:50,880
something to their phone

3229
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:53,280
for example you can also on the network

3230
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:55,280
side much more easily quarantine

3231
02:12:55,280 --> 02:12:58,639
uh network zones and do that in

3232
02:12:58,639 --> 02:13:01,520
a way that's intelligent so that the

3233
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:03,520
impact on the business is known

3234
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:06,239
and uh not disruptive but increases your

3235
02:13:06,239 --> 02:13:07,360
security

3236
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:09,360
for example you might say well geez

3237
02:13:09,360 --> 02:13:10,719
there's some malware that's going

3238
02:13:10,719 --> 02:13:13,679
over smb we're going to block all smb

3239
02:13:13,679 --> 02:13:15,040
ports on the file shares

3240
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:16,480
okay people won't be able to get the

3241
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:18,239
files yes we understand that's going to

3242
02:13:18,239 --> 02:13:19,840
impact the productivity but

3243
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:21,119
it's stopping this malware from

3244
02:13:21,119 --> 02:13:24,079
spreading you can also perform

3245
02:13:24,079 --> 02:13:27,040
pretty surgical isolation by device type

3246
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:28,800
or group or something like that so for

3247
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:29,520
example

3248
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:32,320
if you have a windows piece of malware

3249
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:33,440
that you're considering that you're

3250
02:13:33,440 --> 02:13:34,639
concerned is spreading

3251
02:13:34,639 --> 02:13:36,480
you can lock down all windows devices

3252
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:38,639
but leave other devices other operating

3253
02:13:38,639 --> 02:13:39,119
systems

3254
02:13:39,119 --> 02:13:41,520
unaffected by by this so it gives you

3255
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:43,440
the real precise control

3256
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:47,119
and the way that's very dynamic as well

3257
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:52,159
you can also um in a very advanced phase

3258
02:13:52,159 --> 02:13:53,840
even activate honeypots you might say

3259
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:56,159
huh this device is

3260
02:13:56,159 --> 02:13:58,159
trying to access this server over here

3261
02:13:58,159 --> 02:13:59,920
we're going to flip the switch and then

3262
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:02,400
give the attacker on that device a very

3263
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:03,040
uh

3264
02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:04,400
distorted view of the network and

3265
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:05,760
instead of pointing someone pointing

3266
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:07,119
them to our real systems we'll point

3267
02:14:07,119 --> 02:14:08,960
them to our honeypot systems same host

3268
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:10,639
name same ip addresses but they're

3269
02:14:10,639 --> 02:14:13,520
actually different hosts and

3270
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:14,800
that would be really interesting to see

3271
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:16,719
in action since it's it's a it's a very

3272
02:14:16,719 --> 02:14:17,360
advanced

3273
02:14:17,360 --> 02:14:20,800
uh use case

3274
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:23,280
in terms of eradication zero trust can

3275
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:24,480
certainly help by

3276
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:26,719
offboarding any affected systems you can

3277
02:14:26,719 --> 02:14:27,920
decommission them you can revoke

3278
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:30,159
certificates and access etc

3279
02:14:30,159 --> 02:14:32,480
and you can even completely uh take

3280
02:14:32,480 --> 02:14:33,920
identities off

3281
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:37,679
their ability to uh to access

3282
02:14:38,079 --> 02:14:40,639
this is a very simple step in terms of

3283
02:14:40,639 --> 02:14:41,920
off-boarding the system

3284
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:44,400
uh zero trust doesn't directly help with

3285
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:46,159
say going in and

3286
02:14:46,159 --> 02:14:47,599
cleaning up from malware from a file

3287
02:14:47,599 --> 02:14:49,119
system or restoring from backups or

3288
02:14:49,119 --> 02:14:50,480
things like that although it can help in

3289
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:51,360
those world

3290
02:14:51,360 --> 02:14:53,760
and as always remember don't don't trust

3291
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:56,400
the infected device

3292
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:58,079
all right i know we're we're uh i'm

3293
02:14:58,079 --> 02:14:59,520
gonna go about two or three minutes late

3294
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:00,880
henry

3295
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:04,719
um in terms of recovery

3296
02:15:04,719 --> 02:15:08,480
um clearly zero trust systems need to

3297
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:10,000
because they operate at scale because

3298
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:11,599
they're intended to really support

3299
02:15:11,599 --> 02:15:13,679
ideally all users in an enterprise

3300
02:15:13,679 --> 02:15:14,639
population

3301
02:15:14,639 --> 02:15:16,719
um there will need to be some sort of

3302
02:15:16,719 --> 02:15:17,760
mechanism for

3303
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:19,520
properly and securely onboarding new

3304
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:21,199
devices through some sort of trusted

3305
02:15:21,199 --> 02:15:22,560
out-of-bound mechanism and that's true

3306
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:24,000
whether or not you're recovering from an

3307
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:25,199
incident of course

3308
02:15:25,199 --> 02:15:27,840
um so those are pretty standard steps

3309
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:29,679
and

3310
02:15:29,679 --> 02:15:32,800
as the threat level goes down maybe an

3311
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:34,159
organization goes from red alert to

3312
02:15:34,159 --> 02:15:35,440
yellow alert that's going to

3313
02:15:35,440 --> 02:15:36,079
automatically

3314
02:15:36,079 --> 02:15:38,159
adjust some of the the security

3315
02:15:38,159 --> 02:15:39,920
enforcement across the enterprise by

3316
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:40,560
maybe

3317
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:42,320
relaxing the level of mfa or the

3318
02:15:42,320 --> 02:15:44,400
frequency of prompting for msa

3319
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:47,520
mfa et cetera and then finally

3320
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:49,520
into in lessons learned zero trust is

3321
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:50,800
helpful for giving

3322
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:53,840
very detailed audit logs of what

3323
02:15:53,840 --> 02:15:54,800
actually happened

3324
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:56,880
so you can see what device is connected

3325
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:59,040
to what and that can help you understand

3326
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:00,560
the blast radius of a particular

3327
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:03,520
incident it can also help you look at

3328
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:05,760
which sensors in the environment and

3329
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:07,280
mechanisms that are in place theater

3330
02:16:07,280 --> 02:16:09,360
didn't properly detect the indications

3331
02:16:09,360 --> 02:16:10,480
of compromise

3332
02:16:10,480 --> 02:16:13,040
uh gives you visibility into trying to

3333
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:13,599
understand

3334
02:16:13,599 --> 02:16:15,119
what sort of quarantine response the

3335
02:16:15,119 --> 02:16:16,719
organization took and how effective it

3336
02:16:16,719 --> 02:16:17,679
was

3337
02:16:17,679 --> 02:16:20,000
looking also at alerting mechanisms and

3338
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:21,280
mfa mechanisms

3339
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:22,800
and also gives you the opportunity to

3340
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:24,960
say okay we have this implicit trust

3341
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:25,920
zone here with

3342
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:28,800
you know 50 servers in it and now we

3343
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:29,920
need to invest in

3344
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:31,599
actually further micro segments of those

3345
02:16:31,599 --> 02:16:33,519
so that those 50 servers don't have

3346
02:16:33,519 --> 02:16:35,359
uh unfettered network access to one

3347
02:16:35,359 --> 02:16:37,280
another

3348
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:39,679
okay so that's really the end of what i

3349
02:16:39,679 --> 02:16:40,799
wanted to go through i know that was

3350
02:16:40,799 --> 02:16:41,840
pretty whirlwind

3351
02:16:41,840 --> 02:16:44,160
in the short 30 minutes that we have but

3352
02:16:44,160 --> 02:16:45,200
just to recap

3353
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:48,000
we talked a little about why we're in

3354
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:49,120
the state we're in

3355
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:50,558
uh because we're really have been

3356
02:16:50,558 --> 02:16:52,160
hobbled by traditional networking and

3357
02:16:52,160 --> 02:16:52,799
security

3358
02:16:52,799 --> 02:16:56,160
architectures and technology that zero

3359
02:16:56,160 --> 02:16:56,718
trust

3360
02:16:56,718 --> 02:16:58,959
is a security philosophy and approach

3361
02:16:58,959 --> 02:17:00,799
that when properly implemented

3362
02:17:00,799 --> 02:17:03,280
can significantly improve our

3363
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:04,080
enterprise's

3364
02:17:04,080 --> 02:17:06,398
resiliency and ability to protect

3365
02:17:06,398 --> 02:17:07,359
themselves

3366
02:17:07,359 --> 02:17:09,200
as well as make incident response teams

3367
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:11,359
a lot more effective across the life

3368
02:17:11,359 --> 02:17:12,799
cycle

3369
02:17:12,799 --> 02:17:14,718
i i'm a strong believer in zero trust

3370
02:17:14,718 --> 02:17:16,478
and i think that you know we as security

3371
02:17:16,478 --> 02:17:18,558
leaders have a real obligation to help

3372
02:17:18,558 --> 02:17:20,959
push and pull our organizations to adopt

3373
02:17:20,959 --> 02:17:22,000
this approach

3374
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:23,519
the good news is that everyone in the

3375
02:17:23,519 --> 02:17:24,959
industry is talking about you have the

3376
02:17:24,959 --> 02:17:26,478
president of the united states talking

3377
02:17:26,478 --> 02:17:28,398
about it for goodness sake

3378
02:17:28,398 --> 02:17:30,080
so there's a lot of support for it in

3379
02:17:30,080 --> 02:17:31,679
the industry if you're interested in

3380
02:17:31,679 --> 02:17:32,080
more

3381
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:33,840
uh information i definitely recommend

3382
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:35,679
taking a look at the nist zero trust

3383
02:17:35,679 --> 02:17:37,280
architecture document shown in the lower

3384
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:38,558
left that's what's called special

3385
02:17:38,558 --> 02:17:40,718
publication 800 207.

3386
02:17:40,718 --> 02:17:42,638
the united states department of defense

3387
02:17:42,638 --> 02:17:44,160
also recently introduced

3388
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:45,599
a zero trust reference architecture

3389
02:17:45,599 --> 02:17:47,760
there uh which is

3390
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:50,160
has a lot of specifications and mappings

3391
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:51,359
listed in there but

3392
02:17:51,359 --> 02:17:53,280
the most interesting part to me are some

3393
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:55,200
of the uh the reference components where

3394
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:56,558
they show uh

3395
02:17:56,558 --> 02:17:58,799
logical flows of how things connect to

3396
02:17:58,799 --> 02:17:59,920
each other

3397
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:02,240
the sdp working group in the cloud

3398
02:18:02,240 --> 02:18:04,478
security alliance has put together

3399
02:18:04,478 --> 02:18:07,120
the sdp specification version one

3400
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:08,879
version two is in peer review right now

3401
02:18:08,879 --> 02:18:10,318
and then the architecture guide which i

3402
02:18:10,318 --> 02:18:12,318
recommend and then from a book

3403
02:18:12,318 --> 02:18:13,200
perspective

3404
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:14,879
the xero trust network's book which came

3405
02:18:14,879 --> 02:18:16,318
out in 2017 uh

3406
02:18:16,318 --> 02:18:18,558
is highly highly regarded and uh does a

3407
02:18:18,558 --> 02:18:20,240
great job of talking about that

3408
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:21,519
uh and then my book which came out

3409
02:18:21,519 --> 02:18:24,000
earlier this year uh from a very

3410
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:25,439
vendor-neutral perspective talks about

3411
02:18:25,439 --> 02:18:26,638
zero trust security

3412
02:18:26,638 --> 02:18:28,160
and uh how to look at it from an

3413
02:18:28,160 --> 02:18:29,760
enterprise point of view

3414
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:31,679

02:26:53,600 --> 02:26:55,840
on this year's conference chair as you

3518
02:26:55,840 --> 02:26:57,760
can imagine that a conference chair

3519
02:26:57,760 --> 02:26:58,080
would

3520
02:26:58,080 --> 02:27:00,800
prefer to be at a in-person event and

3521

3522

on however

3524
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:08,080
to the code 19 we needed to change all

3526
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:11,600
uh unfortunately last year and plan in

3527
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:12,880
virtual events

3528
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:15,760
for us there were two main objectives

3529
02:27:15,760 --> 02:27:18,240
which we want to accomplish with

3530
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:21,200
this virtual conference first of all as

3531
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:22,240
you all know

3532
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:25,439
having a perfect lineup of talks second

3533
02:27:25,439 --> 02:27:25,680
of

3534
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:28,479
all we want to have something similar to

3535
02:27:28,479 --> 02:27:30,160
what we normally have at

3536
02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:32,640
the conference at our first conference

3537
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:33,920
social interaction

3538
02:27:33,920 --> 02:27:36,560
building trust and so on so in order to

3539
02:27:36,560 --> 02:27:38,000
accomplish those two

3540
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,240
things we needed to think a bit

3541
02:27:40,240 --> 02:27:41,760
differently

3542
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:44,800
so the program itself

3543
02:27:44,800 --> 02:27:47,040
i must be honest i had not something

3544
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:48,160
much to do about that

3545
02:27:48,160 --> 02:27:50,000
so it was an amazing team which was

3546
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:51,200
working on

3547
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:54,080
uh so first uh the first most important

3548
02:27:54,080 --> 02:27:55,600
are the speakers so this is

3549
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:57,920
the team of speakers who have submitted

3550
02:27:57,920 --> 02:27:58,720
those uh

3551
02:27:58,720 --> 02:28:01,280
really interesting talks were where the

3552
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:03,840
most important part to accommodate

3553
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:05,439
the second most important part is the

3554
02:28:05,439 --> 02:28:06,880
broken committee

3555
02:28:06,880 --> 02:28:09,760
and their broken committee chair so i

3556
02:28:09,760 --> 02:28:10,479
think

3557
02:28:10,479 --> 02:28:12,479
especially for this spiritual conference

3558
02:28:12,479 --> 02:28:13,920
it was a lot of work

3559
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:15,680
which the broken committee and our chair

3560
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:17,359
natsuko put into

3561
02:28:17,359 --> 02:28:19,200
and they as from my perspective they

3562
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:20,800
accomplished exactly what

3563
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:23,920
we wanted to have an amazing program

3564
02:28:23,920 --> 02:28:26,319
for the second part in order that we're

3565
02:28:26,319 --> 02:28:27,200
building trust

3566
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:29,600
we thought a lot about what can we do

3567
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:30,240
and then

3568
02:28:30,240 --> 02:28:32,240
this idea came up that we want to have

3569
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:33,600
this 2d world

3570
02:28:33,600 --> 02:28:35,200
virtual world that people can meet

3571
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:36,640
interact and so on

3572
02:28:36,640 --> 02:28:38,479
so far what i've seen the last three

3573
02:28:38,479 --> 02:28:40,720
days this map was really used a lot

3574
02:28:40,720 --> 02:28:43,359
and a lot of people i met actually also

3575
02:28:43,359 --> 02:28:45,680
the first time in the first conference

3576
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:47,600
uh this worked out so i'm really happy

3577
02:28:47,600 --> 02:28:48,720
that we

3578
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:51,520
did that and that i hoped a lot of you

3579
02:28:51,520 --> 02:28:52,399
enjoyed

3580
02:28:52,399 --> 02:28:55,680
this video come together

3581
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:57,840
lastly i want to thank the most

3582
02:28:57,840 --> 02:28:59,200

02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:30,240

kind of getting used to doing all of

3621
02:30:36,560 --> 02:30:38,880
this virtually we still haven't 100

3622
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:40,160
adapted to

3623
02:30:40,160 --> 02:30:41,840
the global pandemic and i hope we never

3624
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:44,319
have to 100 adapt to the global pandemic

3625
02:30:44,319 --> 02:30:46,160
so i'd like to join

3626
02:30:46,160 --> 02:30:49,920
thomas actually in in

3627
02:30:49,920 --> 02:30:52,319
in wishing for an in-person conference

3628
02:30:52,319 --> 02:30:54,000
in an in-person

3629
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:57,760
event i'd also kind of add nice thanks

3630
02:30:57,760 --> 02:30:58,240
and

3631
02:30:58,240 --> 02:31:01,200
reach out my thanks to uh all the people

3632
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:02,000
involved the

3633
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:03,840
events team that thomas mentioned that's

3634
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:05,120
who could approach our committee the

3635
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:06,720
program committee members

3636
02:31:06,720 --> 02:31:09,040
and so on for this really great and cool

3637
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:11,040
event and i'd also like to extend my

3638
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:12,800
thanks to all the sponsors that allowed

3639
02:31:12,800 --> 02:31:14,160
us to do this for free

3640
02:31:14,160 --> 02:31:17,600
it's a i know sponsors is always kind of

3641
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:18,960
something where we think okay why do we

3642
02:31:18,960 --> 02:31:20,479
need the sponsors but they are actually

3643
02:31:20,479 --> 02:31:22,000
an integral part and it's their

3644
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:23,920
commitment to our community

3645
02:31:23,920 --> 02:31:26,399
to first that makes it possible to do

3646
02:31:26,399 --> 02:31:27,120
this

3647
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:28,960
great event so thanks a lot to all of

3648
02:31:28,960 --> 02:31:30,160
them

3649
02:31:30,160 --> 02:31:34,240
and uh so i think enough

3650
02:31:34,240 --> 02:31:36,240
from my side with that i'd like to hand

3651
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:37,680
over the

3652
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:40,960
mic to brian it's going to be next

3653
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:42,319
year's program chair

3654
02:31:42,319 --> 02:31:44,720
where and we'll kind of do a virtual

3655
02:31:44,720 --> 02:31:47,679
welcome to dublin

3656
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:52,560
but i see brian is not not online

3657
02:31:52,560 --> 02:31:55,600
no brian was not available at this time

3658
02:31:55,600 --> 02:31:58,560
but yes he will be our 2022 program

3659
02:31:58,560 --> 02:32:00,319
chair

3660
02:32:00,319 --> 02:32:02,960
so brian holland is probably not an

3661
02:32:02,960 --> 02:32:04,640
unknown person to

3662
02:32:04,640 --> 02:32:07,840
most of you uh brian living in in

3663
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:08,479
ireland

3664
02:32:08,479 --> 02:32:10,479
as you can imagine working in our field

3665
02:32:10,479 --> 02:32:12,479
is probably fairly busy right now so i

3666
02:32:12,479 --> 02:32:14,000
assume this is part of the reason he

3667
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:15,600
didn't show up here virtually

3668
02:32:15,600 --> 02:32:17,760
i'm confident being gonna get the

3669
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:19,040
situation on the control

3670
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:21,120
until next year so we're gonna have a

3671
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:22,840
