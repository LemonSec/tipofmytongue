and with that let's go ahead and get

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,520
started i'll pass the mic over to our

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,879
session moderator chris gibson

22
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,280
thanks josh much appreciated um again

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,119
i'd like to add my welcome to the last

24
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,119
day so far we've had a crack in two days

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,000
and this one's

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,400
shaped looking good to be as good if not

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,280
better than the first

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,960
two so great so first up we have um

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,600
erickson

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,000
now first typically when people think of

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,439
incident response teams they think of

32
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,280
computer incident response teams beating

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,439
back the evil guys etc etc

34
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,520
but product cert teams are becoming more

35
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,600
and more in our view important in this

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,400
world

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,240
as we end up with incredible complexity

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,680
within our environments

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,600
that then spawns into multi-party

40
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,200
vulnerability coordination

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,920
if a product is having a problem and

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,680
there's a base component how do you

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,759
alert all the vendors who use that

44
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,600
without alerting the bad guys there's

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,119
vulnerability so this is really

46
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,399
interesting to me

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,560
um first as recognize this we have some

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,920
75 product teams in our insert

49
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,399
and very focused and we've recently uh

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,000
announced the integration of the ikarsi

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,680
which is another multi-vulnerability

52
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,799
coordination

53
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,560
piece into first so this is an

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,079
exceptionally topical talk

55
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,680
um i'm really interested to see how this

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,680
goes so with that said i will hand over

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,399
to

58
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,759
umir and thank you very much

59
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,319
yeah thanks a lot chris and uh welcome

60
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,800
to this last day of the presentations i

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,480
hope that you have enjoyed the previous

62
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,800
sessions and are ready for this day

63
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,920
um first presentation for today so

64
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,599
um yeah it's a bit long of a title

65
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,400
step 0 for a multi-party vulnerability

66
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,480
coordination is yet another multi-party

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,480
vulnerability coordination

68
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,720
but don't be scared by it i will go into

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,720
the details of this but just to start

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,200
with

71
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,480
um my name is um and i am currently

72
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,480
leading the operations for

73
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,760
ericsson pcert um before we

74
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,160
go deep into the topic itself i would

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,200
just like to

76
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,680
start with a very small brief background

77
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,959
of erickson itself

78
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,480
i think many of you know um

79
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,800
i would say in in almost all countries

80
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,159
in one way or the other

81
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,959
the telecom networks are built on the

82
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,400
products and services

83
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,879
that ericsson provides um and what i

84
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,480
would like you to focus on

85
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,680
is the amount of products and services

86
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
that are there in our portfolio right

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,440
because it's topical for

88
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,519
the discussion then we that we have

89
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,720
going forward

90
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,879
um so it's over 500 products that we

91
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,720
have in our portfolio

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,480
quite quite a massive one of course

93
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,400
dependencies

94
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,920
and all things like that um but yeah

95
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,000
so small bits about ericsson p-series

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,879
also we have existed since 2004

97
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,959
and during all that time as you can

98
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,040
imagine we have matured many of our

99
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,799
processes many things are we doing

100
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:45,599
better and

101
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,360
some of them we can of course still

102
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,799
learn and improve and that

103
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,120
is exactly the reason for us being in

104
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,040
this community right like every time we

105
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,840
are here

106
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,840
we learn we try to contribute we have

107
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,560
been part of first since 2006 we have

108
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,200
had

109
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,640
uh we have been contributing to

110
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
different initiatives

111
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,760
within pzig and and all those um areas

112
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
also

113
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,480
um yeah very quickly on the stats then

114
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,879
um we are analyzing roughly around over

115
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,918
15 000 vulnerabilities per year and out

116
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:18,639
of which

117
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,000
almost 3 500 plus are something that we

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,320
have

119
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,400
thought um let's say during the past

120
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,520
year that are

121
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,160
somehow applicable to the products that

122
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,639
we

123
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,680
are responsible for um

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,880
but yeah i will not spend too much time

125
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,479
on on this introduction

126
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,320
because i am sure that you are all

127
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,479
waiting for what are we going to talk

128
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,960
about today

129
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,360
before i get into it i would just like

130
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,960
to set the scene a little bit here

131
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
um before we go into what we are going

132
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,880
to talk about so

133
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,720
i think the talk is going to be in two

134
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,000
parts the

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,720
first part is going to be a little bit

136
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,360
of a

137
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,880
war story if i may say um where i

138
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,120
run you through a little bit of a

139
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,400
multi-party

140
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,120
coordination in in our own sense you

141
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
will you will see the twist there

142
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,240
um that we have done in the past

143
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,560
and with the idea that this will give

144
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,400
you some hints or

145
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,560
some thoughts to take back to your teams

146
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,160
and think about different things that

147
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,280
need to be

148
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,680
put into the processes there and of

149
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,400
course i'm

150
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,280
i'm very happy to hear from all of you

151
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,120
on your reflections on this after the

152
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,039
session

153
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,800
and then the second part will be a

154
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,840
little bit more focused on

155
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,520
um how should i call it a thor

156
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,120
experiment

157
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,039
um but i will keep the suspense for now

158
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,479
and uh go forward first

159
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,000
by just uh shortly introducing like so

160
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,560
when we think about a multi-party

161
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,560
vulnerability coordination

162
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,800
if we if we really stay like high level

163
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,919
or a bird's eye

164
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,319
view what what does like that constitute

165
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,319
of course it always constitutes in one

166
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,680
way or the other

167
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,319
a finer who has found something and has

168
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,319
disclosed it to one vendor

169
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,039
or has gone with a public disclosure

170
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,919
then

171
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,600
as the name very well depicts it

172
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,840
includes multiple vendors right and this

173
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,520
could be in many ways like upstream

174
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,440
vendors downstream vendors without going

175
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,000
into the

176
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,479
very tiny details of the things

177
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,319
basically what we're talking about here

178
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,240
is the dependencies and i think

179
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,039
dependencies in today's software

180
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,319
world are almost unavoidable if i may

181
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,280
say so

182
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,759
um the modular approach to building

183
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,319
products

184
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,520
is is is accepted and of course

185
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,000
very valuable but when you do that then

186
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,639
of course

187
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,120
the the complexity of handling the

188
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,080
vulnerabilities

189
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,759
with these dependencies and multiple

190
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,280
parties involved come

191
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,360
in there so that's kind of the second

192
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,199
big factor of a multi-party

193
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,599
uh vulnerability coordination and then

194
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,759
the last piece is of course like okay

195
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,520
now you know about it you have been

196
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,039
coordinating with all the

197
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,080
uh parties involved so in the end you

198
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,319
want some good results out of it

199
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,479
ideally the results would be what they

200
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,759
would be in the shape of

201
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,560
like a coordinated advisory and fixes

202
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,520
going out in

203
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
you know in a very structured sometimes

204
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,599
under embargo and all those sort of

205
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,680
tiny details that come with it but what

206
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,759
we want essentially is

207
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,400
that at the end of the day there is in a

208
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,240
very systemic manner

209
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,840
um a disclosure towards all the parties

210
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,120
that should know about it

211
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,280
and then with with clear instructions

212
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,880
that they can fix it

213
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,440
not gonna go into much more details of

214
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,080
this but

215
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,720
just want to mention that very good

216
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,879
instructions on first website about the

217
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,440
multi-party coordination and disclosure

218
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,360
just go and search for it and i'm sure

219
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,599
you've you find it and i

220
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,639
definitely recommend having a look at it

221
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,160
right so but like okay

222
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,000
so then the twist i talked about

223
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,360
what what do we have here let let's just

224
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:13,840
think

225
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,160
for a moment about it this way

226
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,759
any major vulnerability coordination

227
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
that you need to do within your

228
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,759
organization before you reach a point

229
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,560
where you can go and talk about it with

230
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,599
the partners or customers or even other

231
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,719
part uh vendors and and all usually

232
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,880
there are quite a few steps behind it

233
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,200
like this is what i call step zero in my

234
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,799
presentation basically

235
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,880
before you reach that level where you

236
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,440
can go and you can talk and uh

237
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,600
say like guys we have this issue that

238
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,680
you all need to now take care of or hey

239
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,519
guys here is an issue that all of you

240
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,200
need to fix

241
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,360
these things need to happen if we again

242
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,200
see on a very high level what are those

243
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,000
things

244
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,720
so you would need to inform multiple

245
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,360
multiple

246
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,320
organizations within within your company

247
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,680
of course if you are a

248
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,560
company of of a scale as as us as

249
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,000
ericsson

250
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,040
um and that of course includes

251
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
many many development teams within the

252
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,200
organization given the dependencies of

253
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,320
different components

254
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
that you might need to involve then you

255
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,399
will need to do in a way a little bit of

256
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,480
a disclosure to all these development

257
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,760
teams but also to

258
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,440
many different stakeholders like the

259
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,920
business stakeholders legal and

260
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,360
and many other parties we will touch

261
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,080
upon it um

262
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,000
then of course you need to have some

263
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,800
sort of collaboration between these uh

264
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,880
development teams to do a fix and after

265
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,959
all of this of course you need like the

266
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,080
processes to do

267
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,640
a coherent communication at the at the

268
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,200
end of the day with it

269
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,680
so uh keeping all of these things in

270
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,320
mind

271
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,519
um if we think about it a little bit i

272
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,640
feel

273
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,360
this starts sounding like a lot about

274
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,120
like a multi-party vulnerability

275
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,320
coordination

276
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,440
doesn't it and if it is that

277
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,000
why not apply all the principles

278
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,920
internally also

279
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,760
that would apply to any other

280
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,440
multi-party vulnerability coordination

281
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
yeah it's a little bit of a light bulb

282
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,040
moment but

283
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,880
let's do so that i leave you with this

284
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,079
thought for a moment

285
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,560
we come back to it but before going

286
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,240
there what i would like to do

287
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,440
is i would like to talk about a little

288
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,000
bit of

289
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,120
a case or or a snapshot or a war story

290
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,720
that we have handled um to set the scene

291
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,120
and give like some bases of where i am

292
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,079
coming from

293
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,160
um before i make my points right so the

294
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
example or the case that we are talking

295
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,880
about here

296
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,560
it was a vulnerability that we handled

297
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,160
in the past um

298
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,079
it was identified internally and

299
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,240
it was also in one of our internally

300
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,079
developed components

301
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,200
which happens to be um quite a well used

302
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,920
component

303
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
that is used by other ericsson products

304
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,680
to build on top of it

305
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,560
so here comes the dependency aspect that

306
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,920
i've been talking about like straight

307
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,440
away into this

308
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,079
um additional complexity that we had

309
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:16,720
with this

310
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,440
uh fun coordination was also that

311
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,360
the fix also required some additional

312
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,959
actions to be taken by

313
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,600
the customers it was not like as

314
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,880
straightforward

315
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,760
per se and to just have the security

316
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,360
update come in and fix it there were

317
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,040
some additional actions on top of that

318
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,120
that were needed to be taken

319
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,519
by the customers or users

320
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,240
then if we talk about impact here we

321
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
also had to consider a lot of different

322
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,000
things like right like if uh

323
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,040
if we are talking about

324
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,079
several products there going

325
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,639
one level deeper into the level of

326
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,079
complexity

327
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,279
think about there are usually multiple

328
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,000
uh versions that are under support for

329
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
one product so

330
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,839
that again exponentially increases the

331
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,440
number of

332
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,000
products or versions that you need to

333
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,600
take care of within this context

334
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
then also the impact for each affected

335
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,040
product would be

336
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,720
slightly different right because the

337
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
component is being used by the product

338
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,200
but

339
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,959
it might be used in a very different way

340
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,639
for one product and in a very different

341
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,240
way for the other

342
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,800
for some the priority to fix it might be

343
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,639
very high because of the way they are

344
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,920
using it because of

345
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,040
many other development related processes

346
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,440
that

347
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
that might exist at that time and for

348
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
some it might be not as high as the

349
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,320
others

350
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,560
given different risk profiles and all

351
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,680
those sort of things

352
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,920
so this is this is all that exists and

353
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,800
these are all the

354
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,560
dilemmas that you have to face when you

355
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,399
have this sort of case

356
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,720
okay then if we know about the impact

357
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,399
let's say we know about the impact what

358
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:56,639
is

359
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,760
next next is very much

360
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,720
then you need to have buy-in like before

361
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,880
you can do any sort of

362
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,560
communication especially in this sort of

363
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,240
case where there are additional actions

364
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,839
needed not just like even a

365
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,120
straightforward fix

366
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,519
you need buy-in from many different

367
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,079
business stakeholders first of all

368
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,160
to say like yes we will do the

369
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,000
coordinated fixes we will have the

370
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,839
timelines available for you so you can

371
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,040
plan for it

372
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,040
there will be a lot of help needed from

373
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,200
the market areas legal and communication

374
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,880
to set all of this

375
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,279
machinery in place so that you can in a

376
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,880
very coordinated way

377
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,800
go ahead go ahead with the communication

378
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,279
when it's the time

379
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,600
um and then yeah just uh very

380
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,639
interestingly

381
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,320
i think this is a little bit um

382
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,000
i wouldn't say unique but different when

383
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,240
it comes to to ericsson and telecom

384
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,480
area that you know these these products

385
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,079
are many times part of the critical

386
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,000
infrastructures these are telecom great

387
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,800
products

388
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,160
so doing a completely public disclosures

389
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,480
many times is not the ideal thing for us

390
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,600
to go after

391
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,040
so we need to to let's say tailor the

392
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,040
communication a little bit more towards

393
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,240
our customers that

394
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,160
we know are affected which we of course

395
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,839
know during through

396
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,000
through through all uh the processes

397
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,639
that the market areas have um so yeah

398
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,639
this is the added layer of complexity

399
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,079
that we usually face

400
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,040
uh within within our piecer in ericsson

401
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,800
pcert when it comes to the

402
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,440
communication of these uh issues

403
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,519
outwards

404
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,480
right so this was uh this was a bird's

405
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,160
eye view of how the case

406
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,600
looked but i think still i would like to

407
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:37,920
dig

408
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,399
a little bit more deeper to give you a

409
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,760
bit more of

410
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,839
my insight or how we see from ericsson

411
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:46,560
pc

412
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,480
how the steps go when you have this sort

413
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,959
of a major vulnerability coordination

414
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:51,519
right

415
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,920
so first step is usually always

416
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,199
identification right

417
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,360
so um okay someone found a vulnerability

418
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,639
it could be internal it could be

419
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,160
external

420
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,680
regardless however it reaches you um

421
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,560
now the next step is okay component x

422
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,160
has a vulnerability

423
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,320
who uses component x right so you need

424
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,000
to have the processes

425
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,639
in place in your organization to in an

426
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,160
effective manner

427
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,199
try to figure out and with with a

428
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,120
with a good um visibility say that okay

429
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,720
here is a list of products that are

430
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,480
using this component so

431
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,199
indirectly these ones are also very much

432
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,240
affected

433
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,880
um for for us in ericsson we have like

434
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,680
an

435
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,680
in-house build tool we call ericsson

436
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,680
vulnerability management service

437
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,320
which we use it's based on the cpe and i

438
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,079
will not go into the details

439
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,399
but we have like a very clear bill of

440
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,880
materials that gives us the possibility

441
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,959
to look into this whenever there is a

442
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,880
component that's affected we can tell

443
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,600
which other

444
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,560
products should be involved all right so

445
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,480
as soon as you know here is the list

446
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,440
now that we know is for sure affected

447
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,519
what should be done next

448
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,639
right so the next steps then are

449
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,199
that you need to have some sort of info

450
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:09,920
sessions

451
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,160
how we call them arranged for all these

452
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,759
development teams that

453
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,160
are now facing this issue uh that is

454
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,880
coming through

455
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,279
uh through a dependency that they are

456
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,880
inheriting through a component that

457
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,360
they're using

458
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,920
then what we can recommend for sure is

459
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,000
to have a very clear template also of

460
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,160
what sort of information would you like

461
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,839
to get from these development teams

462
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:32,399
because

463
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,320
for example in this case you might have

464
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
more than 20

465
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,240
development teams working on this right

466
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,440
so you

467
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,519
you want it coordinated that's why it's

468
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,800
always good to have some sort of

469
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,880
template and very clear instructions for

470
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,399
the development teams that these are the

471
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,320
sort of things we would like to

472
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,519
have from you um as a result of your uh

473
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,920
investigation and those things are as as

474
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,880
mentioned here

475
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,600
on the levels of severity levels the

476
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
possible workarounds

477
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,680
and uh when like some sort of

478
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,839
fixed timeline like how long is it going

479
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,599
to give the fix right because

480
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,679
in in an ideal case we would like to

481
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,280
have a coordinated

482
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,439
uh vulnerability disclosure so we are

483
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,640
interested in knowing

484
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,359
the timelines for these things while

485
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,280
this is happening and i can assure you

486
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,439
that this usually takes a while before

487
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,959
all of these things are ready

488
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,839
so while this block is going on in in

489
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,520
parallel and the development teams are

490
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,240
doing their

491
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,960
job in in the best way from the

492
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,720
coordinator's point of view from from

493
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,559
the p-search point of view it's

494
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,640
it's excellent that in parallel you

495
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,000
start

496
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,679
doing this coordination with all the

497
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,520
stakeholders

498
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,520
um all the business stakeholders the

499
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,600
legal the communication

500
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,280
all aspects you need to cover here

501
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,120
because if it's a major coordination

502
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,880
it's very possible that all of these

503
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,200
need

504
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,600
people need to have a say your processes

505
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
will dictate of course who needs to be

506
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,480
involved

507
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,520
um but it's it's it's very important

508
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,280
that at this stage you already involve

509
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,799
them and you start working on

510
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,960
already some sort of a preliminary plan

511
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,480
of course it will change a little bit

512
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,559
based on the information that you will

513
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,640
then get from the

514
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,960
um from the investigation once it's

515
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,039
finalized but it wouldn't change so

516
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,080
drastically

517
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,559
most in most of the cases so there is a

518
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,960
value in starting to do this already

519
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,240
um and then all right so we have the

520
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,200
stakeholders

521
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,600
now are like aligned like okay there is

522
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,240
this

523
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,080
some major coordination coming as soon

524
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,160
as we are ready with the investigations

525
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,000
investigation has now happened in the

526
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,080
development teams what's next

527
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,760
right now we need to talk about the

528
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,360
fixed coordination this

529
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,799
is the time when we kind of know

530
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,320
that all right we have the timelines

531
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,720
from

532
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,520
all the products and we know we have a

533
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,640
little bit of a clear

534
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,799
idea that here here is the timeline when

535
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,960
all the products will be fixing it

536
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,799
will they be fixing at the same time or

537
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,400
not

538
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,200
right so we can decide like okay this

539
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,000
seems to be

540
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,400
the right time frame when we should go

541
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,520
out

542
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,240
with a video communication ideally what

543
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,840
you want to do is of course you want to

544
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,799
communicate

545
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,000
to all your customers at the same time

546
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,320
in in a coordinated manner so that it's

547
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,520
easier for everyone to digest it

548
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,200
the second thing that i really want to

549
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,120
emphasize on is

550
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,039
that you really really need to ensure

551
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,480
that during this phase the

552
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,120
information is somehow controlled right

553
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,840
you don't want to prematurely this

554
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,440
information to go out of course there

555
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,360
are chances of its exploitation

556
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,000
or greater if that happens but also it

557
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,960
creates a lot of

558
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,840
other issues for you to handle um it

559
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,320
creates

560
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,240
additional complexity because if one

561
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,080
customer knows you will have to handle

562
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,520
them so

563
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,400
uh it's it's very very good to be very

564
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:52,960
clear

565
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
about who is involved in these

566
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,400
coordinations that the end the

567
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,840
information stays till

568
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,120
you are ready to disclose it but on top

569
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,679
of that

570
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,720
um always the challenge you will have is

571
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,360
that

572
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,880
this is this uh this will never work

573
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,640
exactly how you wanted it to be there

574
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,320
will always be exceptions

575
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,960
like for example one that i already

576
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,400
explained for this example

577
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,480
is that there were some additional

578
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,280
actions that were needed to be taken

579
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,320
for this fix on top of the uh

580
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,039
on on top of the update itself so we

581
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:27,840
need to plan

582
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,320
who will be doing that uh who will

583
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,559
support that what sort of cost

584
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,039
is associated with that do we have the

585
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,559
right stakeholders

586
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,679
uh onboarded to take it on board um

587
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,320
and and yeah of course then you also

588
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,360
need to think about

589
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,720
there will always be these products that

590
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
will not be fixing it for some reason

591
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,000
they're going out of

592
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,480
life very soon there is some other

593
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,320
reason there is the risk profile is so

594
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,320
low so all these sort of things you need

595
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,120
to

596
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,039
think about and i think it's very good

597
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,520
to have these things already mentioned

598
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,360
on on at least a high level in your

599
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,559
processes so that

600
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,919
you know that if these sort of

601
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,320
situations arise what are your usual

602
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,840
uh lines of action but once you have all

603
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,600
these things in place uh

604
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,159
if you are kind of ready for the final

605
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,960
preparations

606
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,200
and at this stage you need to very much

607
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,880
start thinking about along with your

608
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,159
communications

609
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,000
and legal looking into your sport

610
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,679
contracts also that

611
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,000
okay uh how how should now we be

612
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,919
disclosing it who should be talking to

613
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:30,240
who

614
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,000
at what level in the custom on the

615
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,440
customers side

616
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,200
and then you need to have as i said like

617
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,039
the buy-ins and arrangements already

618
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:37,760
done

619
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
by all the stakeholders if they need to

620
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
take additional actions right because

621
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,280
that needs to be planned accordingly

622
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,520
and finally after all of this we reach

623
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,640
to the point where

624
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,080
you're ready to communicate um and

625
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,240
fingers crossed and you would think that

626
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,360
this should go

627
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,600
without any sort of further ado or

628
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,240
any more complexities at this point um

629
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,919
yeah and as i said like the

630
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,159
communication and like ideally what we

631
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:08,480
want

632
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,720
is usually that it's it's communicated

633
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,760
to all the customers

634
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,280
at the same time there are

635
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,120
uh people to take care of the additional

636
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,280
actions that might be needed to take

637
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,400
to be taken at that point and also

638
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,159
making sure that there will always be

639
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,679
follow-up questions right from the

640
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,600
customer so you need to have

641
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,559
that aspect in mind maybe even have a

642
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,080
faq

643
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,360
prepared already to um to answer those

644
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,200
questions and then also having the staff

645
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,440
available who can do that

646
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,919
but then um the final piece of this is

647
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:42,559
also that

648
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,960
as you can imagine not always all the

649
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,799
customers will take in the fix right

650
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,200
away

651
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,880
right and if you think it's a very

652
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,799
critical issue that you're disclosing

653
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,840
sometimes

654
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,720
you have the in in favor of the bigger

655
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,760
interest

656
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,480
it is always good good to have some sort

657
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,640
of follow-up with the customers

658
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,919
um after you have done the communication

659
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,120
to still put some emphasis

660
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
that hey we think that this is very

661
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,799
important and you should go

662
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,000
with the fixing this issue

663
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,919
as soon as possible right

664
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,320
so this was a little bit of a of an

665
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,360
overview

666
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,679
of how this coordination one of the

667
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,720
coordination and

668
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,200
some insights i hope i i was able to

669
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
deliver some good insights to you

670
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,720
these are the aspects that you need to

671
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,480
usually consider in a

672
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,559
major vulnerability coordination so

673
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,280
now is the i would say the thought

674
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,559
experiment part right

675
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,760
uh on the right side you see the

676
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,600
the first vulnerability coordination

677
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,840
coordinated disclosure as as it is

678
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,279
in the document as use case two

679
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,720
and here like the some rules are defined

680
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,720
and if you just somehow try to link it

681
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,080
to this

682
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,400
case that i just explained you see that

683
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,080
it was found by the internal security

684
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,760
team so that can take the role of the

685
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,960
finder

686
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,039
it affected a modular component so

687
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,039
that's basically the upstream vendor

688
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,840
and all other affected products are then

689
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,080
the downstream vendors naturally

690
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,480
the customers were like the market

691
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,640
support can can act as the defenders

692
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,080
this is not like

693
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,080
like 100 percent of of a linking but

694
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,600
they can of course help if there is a

695
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,960
workaround

696
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,799
and then the customers are always of

697
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,320
course the users and pcr

698
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,440
access the coordinator here so

699
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,320
like my point of saying this is that

700
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,799
with

701
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,679
very small changes done to this and

702
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,520
before i make my point maybe i even go

703
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,000
to the next slide

704
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,840
here what i'm trying to do is that there

705
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,840
are eight variants if you will and i

706
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,320
will

707
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,080
hope that you will go and look at the

708
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,000
first uh

709
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,039
you will have a look at the first

710
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,240
vulnerability coordination document that

711
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,320
i just linked in the in the beginning

712
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,240
there are seven variants for this use

713
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,159
case for coordinated disclosure that are

714
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,120
there

715
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,760
um i will just read out a couple of

716
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,600
those so if you think that security

717
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,360
testing team makes the vulnerability

718
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,240
details

719
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,360
public prior to the remediation

720
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,720
um we considered that as as you saw in

721
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,120
the

722
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,400
explanation that i gave customers do not

723
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,720
deploy our mediation immediately

724
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,600
we we had to consider that also let's

725
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,279
say for example a dependent product

726
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,960
makes the vulnerability details

727
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,840
public prior to their mediation a very

728
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,720
big

729
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,960
uh consideration that we also had in the

730
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,720
process there

731
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,480
the next one for example a dependent

732
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,840
product does not remediate a reported

733
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,080
vulnerability

734
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,799
this is also as as i explained in the uh

735
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,480
exception handling step

736
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,000
it was also there so like

737
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,039
what what my thought around this is um

738
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,279
and what i would kind of like to leave

739
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,279
you with is

740
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,480
if you think about it all like this

741
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,159
modular approach of building products

742
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,320
using one component once it's built and

743
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,600
using it for the other

744
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,440
other products it's quite accepted and

745
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,279
as a matter of fact it's it's it works

746
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,080
very well so it's not going away

747
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,320
and if we accept that the vulnerability

748
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
dependence is

749
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,360
both internal and external they won't be

750
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,960
going away either right

751
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,240
which means that the need for

752
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,559
multi-party vulnerability coordination

753
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,600
will only grow more and more

754
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,679
and what i want to leave you with is the

755
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,440
thought that in my opinion

756
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,640
all the major vulnerability

757
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,600
coordinations

758
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,120
happening internally in your

759
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,960
organizations

760
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,600
are also essentially just multi-party

761
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,840
vulnerability coordinations

762
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,880
because the objectives the roles

763
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,240
and the required steps are fairly

764
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,200
similar very with very small changes

765
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,600
you can basically use very good

766
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,360
framework that is already available to

767
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,240
you

768
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,960
and why why would i say that or why what

769
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,159
is kind of the benefit

770
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,520
why i'm saying this is because

771
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,440
once you have this multi-party

772
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,200
vulnerability coordination guidelines

773
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,760
implemented in your organization

774
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,039
and it's just one it it it helps you in

775
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,000
the way that

776
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,799
it helps train your internal staff for

777
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,640
any external coordinations that might

778
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,520
come

779
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,679
and then like the biggest benefit is

780
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,080
that you have just one process

781
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,559
that they need to follow if there is at

782
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,200
some point

783
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,360
an external uh party that they need to

784
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,240
coordinate with

785
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,320
it's just another stakeholder that's

786
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,919
added to the process

787
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,000
but the process essentially remains the

788
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,279
same

789
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,080
so this is kind of the thought i am

790
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,000
gonna leave you with and i would be very

791
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,799
happy to

792
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,799
listen your thoughts about it in my

793
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,080
opinion all

794
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,880
vulnerability internal coordinations are

795
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,880
multi-party coordinations

796
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,720
and the step zero for even reaching that

797
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,559
multi-party external vulnerability

798
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,159
coordination is yet an

799
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,200
internal one so thanks a lot

800
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,640
uh for listening and uh hope to talk to

801
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,120
you soon

802
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,279
thank you er that was really interesting

803
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,679
i think it sort of it demonstrates the

804
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,360
complexities of the operational

805
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,880
day-to-day

806
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,120
issues that you face with multi-parties

807
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,120
i've worked in big organizations i'm you

808
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:23,440
know

809
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,039
one likes to think that they're all very

810
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,640
seamless and they all work together and

811
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,200
they all follow the same goal

812
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,480
essentially in many ways separate

813
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,000
businesses with separate plans and

814
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,559
priorities

815
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,480
and it can be a real real challenge that

816
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,080
was really interesting i i

817
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,919
very much appreciate that thank you uh

818
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,679
just a quick reminder anyone who wants

819
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,120
to do q a on this

820
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,360
the mayor will be in the work adventure

821
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,559
immediately following

822
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,799
and is available for question q a

823
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,159
question allowance or whatever

824
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,000
so again thank you very much you may i

825
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,360
really appreciate that great

826
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,200
presentation

827
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,399
so now we move to dhana tauren from the

828
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,080
israeli national cert i believe

829
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,640
um who is going to talk take us back to

830
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,480
slightly more familiar ground

831
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,000
um incident response at a national level

832
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,159
having having done this myself um for

833
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,399
certain uk when it was in existence

834
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,320
one of the challenges in national

835
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,720
asserts find is joining the dots

836
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,559
for lots of little things and how you

837
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,240
join all those and understand

838
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,640
at a macro level what's going on to try

839
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,679
and get the strategic

840
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,080
answers that we're looking for um i've

841
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,600
always thought many national asserts are

842
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
not really searched as such they're more

843
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,919
information sharing and analysis

844
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,760
um uh centers analyzing the information

845
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,279
coming in from various things trying to

846
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,200
work out what the big picture is

847
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,840
and then taking that forward so really

848
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,360
interesting looking forward to this one

849
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,080
um i thank you very much for coming

850
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,559
again

851
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,640
q a will be in work adventure after this

852
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,039
so with that said donna uh take it away

853
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,640
thank you

854
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,080
hi and so

855
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,360
great to be here the covet 19

856
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,720
and its quick spread all over taught us

857
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,440
that there are some similarities between

858
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,880
a cyber pandemic

859
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,640
and a biological pandemic a biological

860
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,360
pandemic

861
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,399
is driven by human interactions while a

862
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,200
cyber pandemic is driven by computers

863
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,039
and networks interactions in both cases

864
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,799
the physical boundaries

865
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,120
are blurred the confusion and

866
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,159
uncertainty

867
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,840
are huge and while biological viruses

868
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,360
spread within days or weeks malwares can

869
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,080
be spread

870
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,679
within seconds or days in order to deal

871
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,520
with the biological pandemic

872
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,320
we use healthcare systems and law

873
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,559
enforcement agencies

874
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,200
in order to deal with the cyber pandemic

875
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,880
we use a strong national suit

876
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,919
the israeli national cert is the cdc of

877
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,880
israel center for disease control and

878
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,919
prevention

879
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,039
in the cybersphere this is the cyber

880
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,399
defense center

881
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,519
which serves all the israeli industry

882
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,720
and citizens aiming to improve cyber

883
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,720
resilience

884
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,559
the center operates 24 7 and receiving

885
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,679
online reports about cyber incidents

886
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,360
it provides first aid measures performs

887
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,320
the primary

888
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,440
triage on a national level promotes

889
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,799
vaccination

890
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,840
and educates the attacked entities

891
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,080
how to improve next time

892
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,240
today i would like to speak about a

893
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,640
cyber attack which took place a few

894
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,840
months ago

895
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,519
against the shipping sector in israel

896
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,919
although it started as a specific attack

897
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,120
against a small company it turned into a

898
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,039
cyber pandemic threat

899
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,320
against the israeli economy overlapping

900
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,240
our country's coveted 19 lockdown

901
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,360
i am happy to note that after hours of

902
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,000
an intense

903
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,039
investigation we were able to connect

904
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,279
the dots and to reveal an entire attack

905
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:07,679
infrastructure

906
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,039
which was built quietly over time

907
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,360
apparently in order to prevent their

908
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,320
vaccines

909
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,760
from arriving in israel

910
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,120
so reports entered our set hotline

911
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,679
each and every one of them was mitigated

912
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,200
separately

913
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,279
they included the data leakage in an

914
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,480
electric company

915
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,519
a ransom attack in a law firm and cpa

916
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,399
office

917
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,039
a suspicious connection request to a

918
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,399
shipping company

919
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,080
and many more allegedly there was no

920
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,880
connection

921
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,000
between the incidents but

922
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,279
due to the fact that our cert serves

923
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,320
all the israeli cybersphere and as

924
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,880
excellent visibility throughout the

925
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,000
industry

926
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,360
we investigated all the reports seeking

927
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,879
common ground between them

928
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,120
what raised the red flag for us was a

929
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,320
random report

930
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,440
involving an unrecognized activity

931
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,200
in an erp company thus widening

932
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,039
and intensifying the investigation

933
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,600
the erp company develops technology

934
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,799
solutions

935
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,919
for customs cargo transportation

936
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,440
and international shipping approximately

937
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,200
70 percent

938
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,000
of the cargo companies in israel share

939
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,320
its platforms and

940
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,640
disruptions in the functionality of

941
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,919
these platforms

942
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,480
could cause significant damage to the

943
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,279
shipment of

944
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,320
goods to and from israel

945
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,600
and in this particular time period

946
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,799
the goods also included millions of

947
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,240
kobe 19 vaccines

948
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,360
so we contacted the erp company and

949
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,480
asked for its customers list the list

950
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,799
confirmed our suspicions

951
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,079
and showed us that this company is

952
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,800
probably the common ground we have been

953
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,159
looking for

954
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,800
in essence this is this was the attack

955
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,239
vector

956
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,960
we immediately explained to the erp

957
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,719
company our theory

958
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,599
and offered our assistance in the ir

959
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,440
investigation

960
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,000
we asked their permission to contact

961
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,119
their customers

962
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,480
and provide them with iocs and immediate

963
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,239
recommendations for defence and

964
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,960
mitigations

965
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,599
very quickly customers started to report

966
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,320
back that

967
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,879
they had detected malicious activity in

968
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,199
their security systems

969
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,320
we told them to contact ir teams and

970
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,520
after a while all the ir researchers

971
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,040
began to share their findings at that

972
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,599
moment

973
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,720
we started a race against time trying to

974
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,440
defend the customers before someone

975
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,560
would push the button

976
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,480
october 2020 and before attackers broke

977
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,079
into an erp company

978
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,119
and implemented persistence

979
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,079
currently we still cannot pinpoint the

980
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,079
exact attack vector

981
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,440
however the erp company was completely

982
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,480
unsecured

983
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,640
and provide the perfect playground for

984
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,440
the attackers

985
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,839
non-vulnerabilities vpn without mfa

986
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,680
weak dmz weak rdp and many more

987
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,560
to make matter worse the company also

988
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,280
had a full administrative privileges

989
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,800
for remote access to all its customers

990
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,000
those permissions allowed the attackers

991
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,400
to do whatever they pleased within the

992
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,960
customer's networks

993
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,680
after gaining the initial access the

994
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,480
attackers

995
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,520
studied the network architecture mapped

996
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,640
the customers

997
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,960
and created and created a list of

998
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,320
targets

999
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,200
in addition they started their letter

1000
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,240
movement

1001
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,760
using real usernames and passwords

1002
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,839
which may indicate that they had access

1003
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,720
to the active directory

1004
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,839
all this while blurring their footprints

1005
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,359
the attackers received access to

1006
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,119
customers networks

1007
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,160
and began to expand towards them using

1008
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,160
the backup server

1009
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,480
for the connection they used mainly

1010
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,200
unsecured ldp and vpn channels

1011
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,359
for the persistence the used legitimate

1012
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,359
tools and processes

1013
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,079
implemented a task schedule created a

1014
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,359
local admin user

1015
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,880
and many more they utilized a password

1016
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,839
that contained an old phrase in their

1017
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:02,960
language

1018
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,240
meaning son of a donkey they also

1019
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,000
implemented an attack tool

1020
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,400
allowing them to completely shut down

1021
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,760
the company's activity

1022
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,240
until that moment the attackers operated

1023
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,079
in a silent mode disguised their traces

1024
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,720
and made it very difficult to expose

1025
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,959
them

1026
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,359
in december 2020 we saw a plot twist

1027
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,160
one of the customers identified an

1028
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,960
attempt

1029
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,320
to run ldp from a zlp company backup

1030
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,520
server

1031
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,119
something that never had happened before

1032
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,839
he reported to our certain to the erp

1033
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:46,800
company

1034
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,480
which founded the activity in the

1035
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,480
firewall and immediately

1036
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,760
shut down all connections via rdp

1037
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,119
channel

1038
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,160
following that they contacted an ir

1039
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,640
company

1040
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,040
the ir company sent us an initial report

1041
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,320
and began to explore the network their

1042
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,000
immediate findings

1043
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,160
showed that the company had many

1044
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,599
security flaws

1045
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,440
and he didn't keep logs the ir company

1046
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,000
installed

1047
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,359
edrs but they made a huge mistake by

1048
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,720
deleting a few logs

1049
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,320
that did exist and because of that

1050
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,119
mistake

1051
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,240
and a number of others along the way the

1052
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,440
erp company decided to end the contract

1053
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,520
and to try another ir company

1054
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,079
the new ir company joined forces with

1055
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,040
our organization's ir division

1056
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,800
enabling investigation of the network

1057
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,160
moreover they shared their findings

1058
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,800
with the mssp researcher from abroad

1059
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,280
there the researcher gained access to

1060
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,000
the situ

1061
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,800
server and shared with the ir company

1062
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,599
the list of

1063
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,560
victims as well as the username and

1064
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,119
password of the c2

1065
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,240
the list contained approximately 90

1066
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,200
victims

1067
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,240
half of them are direct customers of the

1068
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,279
erp company

1069
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,520
the status server revealed the full list

1070
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,520
of the attacked entities

1071
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,560
including the attack status of each and

1072
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,119
every one of them

1073
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,320
the attackers realized that someone else

1074
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,359
was entering

1075
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,760
their server because each login

1076
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,599
throughout the person

1077
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,960
was already inside so they shut down the

1078
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,000
web server

1079
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,359
but the researcher managed to gain ssh

1080
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,759
access

1081
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,280
more and more ir teams started to share

1082
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,400
their findings

1083
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,880
on the social media and this is the

1084
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,520
moment

1085
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,640
when the attackers changed their modus

1086
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,520
operandi

1087
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,880
and started a mind game using social

1088
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,000
media as well

1089
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,720
as the massive lack of information from

1090
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,078
the victims networks

1091
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,440
among other things the researchers

1092
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,760
attributed the attack to pay to key

1093
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,000
group

1094
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,880
there is a consensus among the cyber

1095
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,839
security

1096
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,839
community in israel regarding the attack

1097
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:38,720
attribution everyone

1098
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,040
understands that the attack was carried

1099
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,119
out by the pay-to-key group

1100
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,599
most of them attribute the group to a

1101
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,319
larger one known as fox kitten

1102
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,800
however there are disagreements about

1103
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,520
the group's

1104
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,400
motives whether it was a financial

1105
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,079
motive or whether it was

1106
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,200
cyber terrorism or cni

1107
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,599
until recently the group used cyber

1108
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:02,319
attacks

1109
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,760
in order to make money however in some

1110
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,240
cases

1111
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,800
we have seen signs of anti-israeli

1112
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,760
ideology

1113
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,160
and a desire to cause psychological

1114
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,240
effect

1115
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,400
previous attacks attributed to this

1116
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,920
group included

1117
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,720
encrypting information and demanding

1118
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,560
ransom payments

1119
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,440
and in order to make the victims pay the

1120
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:25,839
group

1121
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,400
used the double extortion tactic

1122
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,200
demanding

1123
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,680
payment for release for the release of

1124
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,640
the files

1125
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,760
while threatening to leak information

1126
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,319
indeed some of the victims that refused

1127
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:39,200
to pay

1128
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,920
found the most sensitive information

1129
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,280
revealed in the darknet

1130
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,760
this is the moment in which the

1131
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,319
attackers move to a high profile

1132
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:51,520
activity

1133
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,319
in order to exercise influence and

1134
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:55,040
widespread

1135
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,800
panic they did it

1136
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,480
by conducted cynical polls suggesting

1137
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,359
the next

1138
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,560
victim's identity and activating

1139
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,000
dedicated pages in the social media

1140
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,240
they posted information about the

1141
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,680
victims as well as

1142
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,640
promising a new victim every wednesday

1143
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,640
all this happened while releasing

1144
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,440
samples

1145
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,160
and dumps from the victim's neck rocks

1146
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:26,880
proving

1147
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,119
that the leaks were up to date

1148
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,000
for example a ransom attack against an

1149
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,440
electric company

1150
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,319
a ransom an attack against an industry

1151
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,280
entity

1152
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,760
publishing usernames and passwords of

1153
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,520
security managers

1154
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,359
threatening to publish technical

1155
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,440
documents and studies

1156
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,880
about secret projects an attack

1157
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,280
against a company which provides

1158
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,359
security solutions

1159
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,520
according to pay2k they obtained

1160
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,280
sensitive information

1161
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,760
about the cost the company's customers

1162
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,000
an attack against a company which

1163
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,119
develops ai

1164
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,480
chips the group obtained access to the

1165
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,520
source code

1166
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,160
and since the company didn't agree to

1167
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,920
pay the ransom fee

1168
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,640
the code was leaked on the darknet

1169
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,839
a certain acquire posted pictures of

1170
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,359
five men who allegedly

1171
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,440
belonged to the paid to key group and

1172
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,359
were responsible for the attack

1173
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,760
according to his threat intelligence

1174
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,720
research

1175
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,599
the group used non-vulnerabilities with

1176
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:40,000
public

1177
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,200
plc and there was no indication for

1178
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:43,920
using

1179
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,160
zero-day or one-day vulnerabilities

1180
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,240
meanwhile the israel research took the

1181
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,160
necessary measures to improve

1182
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,280
industrial resilience and to prevent

1183
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,560
disruptions

1184
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,560
in transportation of the cov19 vaccines

1185
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,440
the third identified the attack in its

1186
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,480
early stages

1187
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,119
and took measures to disarm the click

1188
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:09,760
the ticking

1189
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,800
bomb shut down connections between the

1190
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,599
erp network and critical infrastructure

1191
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:16,720
networks

1192
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,359
conducted an ier investigation in the

1193
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:20,800
erp company

1194
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,680
as well as in its customers and other

1195
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,960
victims

1196
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,599
made the threat intelligence research in

1197
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,920
order to find additional ttps and

1198
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,599
diocese

1199
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,079
shared them with the industry and made

1200
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:34,720
sure

1201
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,599
they are classified in the blacklists of

1202
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,319
the security systems

1203
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,520
published alerts which are up to date

1204
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,760
first tlp read alerts for customers only

1205
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,400
which included iocs and immediate

1206
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,520
recommendations

1207
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,240
for defense and then with the

1208
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,280
understanding

1209
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,160
that there were many more victims we

1210
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,960
published alerts to the entire industry

1211
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,839
made phone calls to the victims and sent

1212
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:04,240
them

1213
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,200
ir teams

1214
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,880
throughout the event we at the third

1215
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,119
found ourselves dealing with

1216
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,319
many dilemmas which required

1217
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,359
prompt decisions

1218
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,720
for example do we need to publish an

1219
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,280
alert to the public with all the iocs

1220
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,800
and ttps

1221
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,359
so no because it will damage the

1222
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:33,040
reputation of the erp

1223
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,960
company no because the attackers

1224
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,680
might change their modus operandi and do

1225
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,640
things that

1226
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,680
they didn't necessarily intend to do

1227
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,040
at the current point of time for example

1228
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,920
move to a high mode activity change the

1229
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,520
c2 address

1230
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,280
run the ransom simultaneously hasten to

1231
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,720
leak information

1232
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,000
and more and another reason

1233
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,119
why not is that it could cause panic in

1234
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:03,920
the public

1235
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,160
regarding the arrival of their vaccines

1236
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,319
should we shut down the connection

1237
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,240
between the erp company

1238
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,359
and critical infrastructure entities

1239
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:18,160
yes the israeli state is committed by

1240
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:18,800
law

1241
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,599
to our critical infrastructures which

1242
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,040
are considered

1243
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,560
as a national interest no because

1244
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,119
we are a trusted zone that protects

1245
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,920
privacy

1246
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,000
and confidentiality another reason why

1247
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,720
not

1248
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,880
is that it could disrupt the business

1249
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,079
continuity

1250
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,040
of the critical infrastructure and all

1251
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:41,440
the

1252
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,359
companies that depend on it

1253
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,720
should we use the information we got

1254
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,760
from the c2

1255
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,160
or not yes by all means necessary

1256
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,880
yes it had all the details we needed

1257
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,640
regarding the victims

1258
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,280
we had to do everything in our power to

1259
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,160
prevent the national catastrophe

1260
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,880
no because the information was received

1261
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,960
in a problematic way

1262
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,000
should we ask ourselves where our

1263
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,520
boundaries are

1264
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,079
are the cases where it and our received

1265
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,800
information

1266
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,400
should a cert as a government entity

1267
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,640
share information with external

1268
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,400
researchers

1269
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,559
yes it should be a give and take

1270
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,240
relationship

1271
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,839
no we need to protect the privacy of

1272
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:39,040
organizations and debate and

1273
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,000
individuals moreover we cannot share

1274
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,880
information

1275
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,079
before it is validated and

1276
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,040
no once we have released the information

1277
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,400
we have no control

1278
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,079
in the way people will use it

1279
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,359
should we provide the erp company

1280
00:47:58,359 --> 00:47:59,520
confirmation

1281
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,960
that it can return to business yes

1282
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,960
a business must be operational to

1283
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,800
survive

1284
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,440
no it is not our job to do security

1285
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,960
tests

1286
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,160
and no because we are unfamiliar with

1287
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:14,480
the

1288
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,040
remediation process that the company

1289
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,240
carried out

1290
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,200
and last but not least do we need to

1291
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,960
speak with the media

1292
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,240
so no because we sanctify the privacy

1293
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,480
and confidentiality of the reporters

1294
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,760
yes the public needs to know and

1295
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,920
yes because there is a serious media

1296
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,280
echo and a lot of

1297
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,880
rumors and confusion it is our duty to

1298
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,599
put things

1299
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:49,599
in order

1300
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,319
bottom line

1301
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,000
israel is a tough place to live we are

1302
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,720
being attacked from all sides

1303
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,520
the motives for the attacks are many and

1304
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,119
varied it can be

1305
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,319
cni cne cna and

1306
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:10,000
many more very easily they can turn into

1307
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,319
a cyber pandemic

1308
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:15,040
the only way to deal with the situation

1309
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,280
is a strong national cert

1310
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,640
which operates as a cdc cyber defense

1311
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,640
center third can see the whole picture

1312
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,599
it can connect the dots and this is the

1313
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,359
way to stop the pandemic

1314
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,640
and to flatten the curve

1315
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:44,000
thank you

1316
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,680
you donna the diner that was really

1317
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,359
interesting i i recognize

1318
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,599
a lot of those dilemmas from when i

1319
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:52,480
worked in the the uk's national cert

1320
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,160
um some of those challenges have

1321
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,400
obviously not gone away and and they are

1322
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,240
difficult to answer um

1323
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,119
i think it highlights the role that the

1324
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:01,599
national

1325
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,200
cert plays in joining dots and to be

1326
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,640
fair any sees such

1327
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,400
but it's joining all those little bits

1328
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,680
of information you're getting from all

1329
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,520
over the place giving that big picture

1330
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,520
in your case across the country but even

1331
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,800
in an ordinary organization across

1332
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,319
different departments across different

1333
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:15,119
areas

1334
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,119
different indicators and so on really

1335
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:18,800
shows how that needs to be analyzed

1336
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,359
joined up

1337
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,440
and then you can see the bigger picture

1338
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,079
how many times have we seen attacks that

1339
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,480
were all signaled in advance that we all

1340
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,920
knew you know that

1341
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,920
the little the indicators were all there

1342
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,000
but nobody joined it up until it becomes

1343
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,640
too late

1344
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,079
so that's really important i think

1345
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,680
that's such a really valid valuable

1346
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,400
thing

1347
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,440
um the the coordination role then you

1348
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,160
you

1349
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,839
talked about the how do you how do you

1350
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,440
publicize this how do you

1351
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,520
how do you arrange the various pieces

1352
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,119
that they do things at the right time in

1353
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,640
the right place and sort of synchronize

1354
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,760
this manner rather than

1355
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,000
all firing off so again this is what sea

1356
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,839
certs

1357
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:56,559
that analysis and coordination almost

1358
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:57,599
more than

1359
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,599
actually jumping up with hardware and

1360
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,359
doing sort of response it's that ability

1361
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:02,960
to see that big picture

1362
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,640
so really i thank you very much indeed

1363
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,000

my name is christine cetanov and i'm a

1436
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:08,239
graduate student at purdue university

studying digital forensics and homeland

1438
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:12,320
security i'm also a research assistant

1439
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,920
at the cybertap program

1440
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,920
and a forces fellow if you would like to

1441
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,600

1442
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,360
my contact information is displayed on

1443
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,839
the screen

1444
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,440
and since we have limited time this talk

1445
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,040
is pre-recorded so i can answer

1446
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,640
questions in the chat during the

1447
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,320
presentation

1448
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,560
a slightly extended recording will also

1449
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,400
be published at the first annual

1450
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,040
conference site in addition there's some

1451
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:39,760
material

1452
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,880
that i have published on the forces blog

1453
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,040
that can give you more details on the

1454
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:49,840
topics that we're going to discuss today

1455
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,679
only about 15 percent of time money and

1456
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:57,120
manpower is spent on espionage as such

1457
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,520
the other 85 percent is a slow process

1458
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:00,640
which we either call

1459
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:03,600
ideological subversion or active

1460
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,600
measures

1461
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,600
activeness in the language of the kgb

1462
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,120
or psychological warfare i'm not using

1463
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:11,440
this

1464
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,360
in order to say all psyops come from

1465
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,360
russia but to show you how much

1466
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,120
about the russian cold war intelligence

1467
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:20,159
operations is not known by hollywood

1468
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:22,320
why by hollywood well because what

1469
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,080
people know about intelligence

1470
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,000
they learned from hollywood and james

1471
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,920
bond and jack ryan

1472
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,440
and in particular from johnny english

1473
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,960
particularly john english well we have

1474
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,840
all heard about the infamous kgb and all

1475
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,840
the bad stuff that they have done

1476
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:43,120
and yet we haven't really learned much

1477
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:46,320
because according to bismanov we only

1478
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:46,880
have seen

1479
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,400
those 15 percent the tip of the iceberg

1480
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,560
also imagine all those things we don't

1481
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,320
know about and the media doesn't want to

1482
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,600
tell us

1483
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,719
why well draw your conclusions later

1484
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:00,880
but for now i want to underline that

1485
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,320
this is not a talk about the russian

1486
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,199
collusion

1487
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:05,120
and russian disinformation and there

1488
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,560
will be no attribution or

1489
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,600
guilt assignment in this talk but rather

1490
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,600
we'll cover the media effects that are

1491
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:15,440
used in this type of operations

1492
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,920
and now let's look at the targets

1493
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,400
methods tools and goals

1494
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,320
it is important to understand that the

1495
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,080
target of the operation is not the

1496
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:29,040
individual but society as a whole

1497
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,280
and the methods are designed to work on

1498
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,320
groups and exploit

1499
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:35,360
group dynamics and societal effects the

1500
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,960
twos are not bots

1501
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:40,800
or ads but rather there are other people

1502
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,719
who in turn influence the opinion of the

1503
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:44,080
masses

1504
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,000
those operations aim to change the

1505
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,239
attitude of the population

1506
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:50,159
just to give you an example during the

1507
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:51,520
2016 election

1508
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:53,280
there was a lot of talk about russian

1509
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,719
bots and the ira

1510
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,880
influencing the election do you think

1511
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,840
that all adults

1512
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,320
whether they knew how to computer or not

1513
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,440
with the pyramid script

1514
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,440
and built a graph of twitter both

1515
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:04,960
relations

1516
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,440
and then performed sentiment analysis to

1517
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,000
understand

1518
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,480
how they are supporting who those bots

1519
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:11,600
are supporting

1520
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:15,280
no it was a bunch of pundits who

1521
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,760
gave their opinion about what they see

1522
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:18,640
and how they

1523
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,280
think things played out and this is what

1524
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,040
formed people's opinion

1525
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,280
just a spoiler alert this is also known

1526
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,199
as two-step flow of information

1527
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:29,360
which we'll cover later but uh think

1528
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,560
about this example and

1529
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,920
also we'll see how this may play a role

1530
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:34,800
in the so-called

1531
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:38,400
passive information operations

1532
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,679
next to influence the change an

1533
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:43,280
effective messaging campaign must be

1534
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:44,480
organized

1535
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,080
to spread the message more efficiently

1536
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,920
the attacker would rely on elements of

1537
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,360
communications theory

1538
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,360
this will ensure optimal propagation and

1539
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,040
better adoption rate

1540
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,960
in this talk we'll focus on those

1541
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,159
let's start with something familiar and

1542
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:02,719
straightforward the filter bubble

1543
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:04,640
although one of the newer concepts it is

1544
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,280
well understood and very powerful

1545
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,600
in 2005 google launched personalized

1546
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,880
search

1547
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,560
as a result the engine would remember

1548
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,719
what you're searching for analyze it and

1549
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:15,920
then customize

1550
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,400
all of your subsequent searches so

1551
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,159
topics of no previous interest

1552
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:22,480
will be de-prioritized and end up way

1553
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,159
down in your search results

1554
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:26,400
in turn you're unlikely to see any

1555
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,920
contradicting information

1556
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,560
or things that are different now

1557
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,239
consider the same pattern with social

1558
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:32,960
media

1559
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:36,400
like google news facebook twitter

1560
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,400
the resulting filter would not only

1561
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,760
prevent you from getting diverse

1562
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:40,960
information

1563
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,040
but you are unlikely to see dissenting

1564
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,000
opinions

1565
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,159
and discussions which may change your

1566
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:47,760
views

1567
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,159
this in turn creates isolation and echo

1568
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:51,199
chambers

1569
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:54,080
and is similar to agenda setting in a

1570
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:54,880
way

1571
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,880
the filter bubble shows you only the

1572
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:58,800
things you are already interested in

1573
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,960
and agree with and filters away

1574
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,000
everything else by

1575
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,400
de-prioritizing it to the point you not

1576
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,520
see it

1577
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,360
as an added effect it makes the things

1578
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,960
you're interested in

1579
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,600
even more important first subconsciously

1580
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,159
because

1581
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:14,159
you're constantly reminded about them

1582
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:16,320
and second by making them occupy

1583
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,120
dominant space in your online campus

1584
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:22,159
which is we'll discuss which which we're

1585
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:22,880
going to discuss

1586
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:26,000
under cultivation effects in extreme

1587
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,440
cases we can

1588
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:31,839
it can achieve self-radicalization

1589
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,239
in the past people would wake up in the

1590
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:38,320
morning pick up the newspaper and read

1591
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,080
it before they get to the office

1592
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,600
of course they would only read the first

1593
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,280
few pages and the result the most

1594
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:45,679
important news was on the first page

1595
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:48,239
then followed by less important ones and

1596
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:50,719
by the ones that would never get read

1597
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:53,600
sound familiar anyway when people get to

1598
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,000
work

1599
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,679
or in a social setting everyone would

1600
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:57,920
have similar set of topics to discuss

1601
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,280
and those would become the most

1602
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,280
important topics of conversation for the

1603
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,080
day

1604
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,159
this in turn improves accessibility in

1605
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:05,760
memory because they are constantly

1606
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,560
reminded

1607
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:09,280
and second because it appears to be

1608
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,880
important for everyone

1609
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,440
uh where everybody else is talking about

1610
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,600
on top of that we have the group dynamic

1611
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,280
and people wanting to fit in

1612
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:20,480
does that sound familiar note

1613
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,400
that this has nothing to do with the

1614
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,080
actual importance of the

1615
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:27,120
topics and even their content it only

1616
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:27,840
has to do

1617
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,719
with them being accessible in memory and

1618
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:32,400
having a common ground to discuss with

1619
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,760
others

1620
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,840
agenda setting plays essential role in

1621
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,360
influence operations

1622
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,840
on one end it introduces a topic for

1623
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:40,960
further discussion

1624
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,040
which cascades down to discussions in

1625
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,760
cafes offices and other social settings

1626
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,760
and on the other the frequency with

1627
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,360
which it is introduced

1628
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,120
determines the public's perceptions of

1629
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,560
its importance

1630
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,800
agenda setting may occur on many

1631
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:55,920
different levels

1632
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,400
for example the editor may decide which

1633
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,120
of the written stories to promote higher

1634
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,760
at the same time they prioritize the

1635
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:04,960
journalists workload

1636
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,560
and which stories to cover with higher

1637
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:09,280
priority then there is the media owner

1638
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,760
who can guide the editor-in-chief's work

1639
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:12,320
and

1640
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,719
there are also the advertisers who can

1641
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:16,080
apply pressure

1642
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:20,159
to add revenue on the owner

1643
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:23,440
now while agenda setting is about

1644
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,199
what content is actively pushed and

1645
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:26,480
prioritized for higher

1646
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,040
uh for for for the audience to see

1647
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,960
gatekeeping is just the opposite

1648
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:35,840
this is the stories that are never told

1649
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,080
as mentioned in the previous slide

1650
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,840
gatekeeping and agenda setting

1651
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,239
are the two sides of a coin while agenda

1652
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:43,199
setting is about

1653
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:45,280
introducing topics gatekeeping is about

1654
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,960
the suppression of topics facts and

1655
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,400
views

1656
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,159
like just like agenda setting

1657
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:52,000
gatekeeping can happen on different

1658
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:52,960
levels

1659
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,400
from the journalist who makes the

1660
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,199
judgment what fact to me from a story

1661
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:59,360
to the editor-in-chief who blocks

1662
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,440
stories from being published

1663
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:04,239
gatekeeping is also known as censorship

1664
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:05,679
when oppressive regimes

1665
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:08,560
suppress certain stories that are not

1666
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:11,120
published due to states control

1667
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,120
traditionally gatekeeping has been

1668
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,239
observed and studied in mass

1669
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:15,760
communication but it can also be

1670
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,520
observed in social media

1671
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,199
however it is very difficult to

1672
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:20,719
implement unless

1673
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:22,880
the social media platform itself is

1674
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,440
complicit

1675
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:29,280
as mentioned gatekeeping is relatively

1676
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:30,960
easy to implement in traditional media

1677
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,199
such as newspapers and television

1678
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:35,120
however it is much harder to do so in

1679
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,880
social networks like twitter

1680
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,280
in the former the editors and desk

1681
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:40,800
chiefs are easy to control

1682
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,480
chokepoints and in the latter the

1683
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,840
information routes

1684
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:46,639
around choke points because people learn

1685
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:48,159
from other people

1686
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:49,920
it is interesting to explore the full

1687
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,840
information in such a setting

1688
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:55,120
in general we observe two groups content

1689
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,639
producers and consumers

1690
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:58,800
which are not clearly segregated as a

1691
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,560
producer can also be a consumer

1692
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:03,840
and vice versa it is observed a consumer

1693
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,920
will take the information from somebody

1694
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,480
they trust and follow the influencer the

1695
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,760
influencers themselves

1696
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,440
may have been influenced by another

1697
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:14,400
influencer mass or specialized media

1698
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:17,120
as they say everything is new is just

1699
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,800
well forgotten old

1700
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,880
this two-step flow of information was

1701
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,800
first hypothesized by lars

1702
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:25,760
lazersfeld in the late 40s and developed

1703
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,280
further in the 50s

1704
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,440
in this theory what we called

1705
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:30,480
influencers

1706
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,960
is called opinion leaders and it

1707
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,199
stipulates that most people do not form

1708
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:37,760
their opinion by direct influence by

1709
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:38,719
mass media

1710
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:40,400
but instead they are influenced by a

1711
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,320
limited number of opinion leaders

1712
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,679
whom they trust those can be family

1713
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:49,679
spiritual leaders friends and the like

1714
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:51,520
particularly interesting is the drug

1715
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,679
study discussed by lazersfeld

1716
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:55,600
where a highly coherent group of opinion

1717
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,400
leaders in this case medical doctors

1718
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,320
formed the same medical opinion and

1719
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,239
started prescribing the same medication

1720
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:04,159
at approximately the same time without

1721
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:08,239
any prior coordination

1722
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:10,719
well one detail i missed is that they

1723
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:13,040
were all exposed to publications in a

1724
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,120
narrow set of specialized medical

1725
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,440
journals going back to influence

1726
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:18,560
operations

1727
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,560
it appears it would be relatively easy

1728
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,480
to influence a group of doctors

1729
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:25,040
on any medical issue by ensuring the

1730
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,400
right articles

1731
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,320
are published in a couple of the most

1732
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,320
prestigious magazines

1733
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,719
and even if those articles are later

1734
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:33,840
retracted

1735
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,520
their infos will persist because of some

1736
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,840
of the other media effects

1737
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,920
media and cognitive effects like

1738
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,840
cultivation which we're going to discuss

1739
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:42,800
later

1740
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:46,400
can you think of a real life example

1741
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,719
as mentioned earlier studies have

1742
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,639
discovered that it is better to use

1743
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:52,400
larger number of smaller scale

1744
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:54,719
influencers than small number of big

1745
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:55,760
influencers

1746
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:05,840
this is because

1747
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,480
is far more efficient because it allows

1748
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:19,679
custom tailoring

1749
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:22,719
of the messaging in summary

1750
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:24,560
the information from mass and social

1751
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,080
media appears not

1752
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,639
to be directly ingested by most of the

1753
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:30,080
influenced

1754
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,719
as the hypodermic needle theory suggests

1755
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:33,920
but instead

1756
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,239
a two-step flow is discovered where

1757
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:38,080
information flows from an original

1758
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:40,719
source to intermediary opinion leaders

1759
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:42,880
and then this information is consumed by

1760
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:43,840
the majority

1761
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,760
of the subjects mainly through the power

1762
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,360
of social connections

1763
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,840
it is important to note that other

1764
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:51,040
opinion leaders may

1765
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,040
influence the opinion leaders themselves

1766
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,320
and those structures are

1767
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:57,440
higher hierarchical or peer

1768
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,120
because of this highly distributed

1769
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,280
system one-to-many approaches like

1770
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,199
gatekeeping and agenda setting are

1771
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:05,360
challenging to implement and it is

1772
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,440
it is when there is need for a

1773
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,159
decentralized or many-to-many approach

1774
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:15,839
so meet the spiral of silence

1775
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:17,679
the spiral of silence is a

1776
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:19,440
communications theory that explains the

1777
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:20,960
dynamics of expressing

1778
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:24,000
one's opinion in a public setting

1779
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,840
this theory states that social groups or

1780
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:29,280
individuals who perceive their opinions

1781
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,679
as unpopular or losing popularity

1782
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:34,639
are less likely to express their opinion

1783
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:36,639
this in turn reinforces the expression

1784
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:38,080
of contradicting opinions

1785
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:40,400
and leads to a spiraling effect where a

1786
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,080
particular side of an argument

1787
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:45,040
may not be expressed it is important to

1788
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:47,120
note that this is solely a function of

1789
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:47,760
perception

1790
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,360
and does not need to represent the

1791
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:51,360
objective reality

1792
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,440
furthermore this does not immediately

1793
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,360
change the opinion of people who are

1794
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:56,560
suppressed

1795
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,600
and often the perceived minority turns

1796
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,960
out to be a majority

1797
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,679
does the term silent majority it takes a

1798
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:05,840
relatively small amount of very vocal

1799
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:06,639
proponents

1800
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:10,159
to suppress a particular opinion making

1801
01:29:10,159 --> 01:29:12,400
it particularly easy to weaponize in an

1802
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:15,040
influence operation from an inference

1803
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:16,480
operation point of view

1804
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,560
this is where many bots come in handy to

1805
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:19,679
create noise

1806
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:21,360
and convince people that their opinion

1807
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:22,800
is not popular

1808
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,920
does suppress it another prime example

1809
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,480
of spiral of silence is cancer culture

1810
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,719
to reinforce the effect people who

1811
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:32,719
express unpopular beliefs are attacked

1812
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:34,800
and shamed in public

1813
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,639
as individuals become hesitant to

1814
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:38,800
express themselves and

1815
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,520
the number of descending opinions in the

1816
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,040
group starts to decrease

1817
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,360
creating an echo chamber and we see

1818
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:46,800
cultivation effects

1819
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,679
and also grouping

1820
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,440
echo chamber is a setting where no

1821
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:56,080
dissenting opinions are expressed

1822
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:58,000
they work within a group of people and

1823
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,120
amplify a message

1824
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,840
which is already planted in that group

1825
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:02,400
thus

1826
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,560
their usefulness is not to recruit new

1827
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:07,040
followers but to solidify the beliefs of

1828
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:07,840
a person or

1829
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:11,199
group in extreme cases echo chambers may

1830
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:14,400
even be used to radicalize the audience

1831
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,560
from influence operations point of view

1832
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,159
an echo chamber is useful to maintain

1833
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:21,600
the status quo and keep belief strong

1834
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,719
in addition examples could be far right

1835
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:26,159
and far left forums

1836
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:28,960
in this example the overall goal of

1837
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,800
creating an echo chamber

1838
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,880
or echo chambers is to polarize a

1839
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,040
society from that point of view it is

1840
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,880
beneficial to feed opposing

1841
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:39,679
view echo chambers in addition echo

1842
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:41,440
chambers are very useful for spreading

1843
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,600
propaganda

1844
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:45,679
echo chamber is not to be confused with

1845
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:47,360
a filter bubble

1846
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:52,159
where the actor and subject is oneself

1847
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,800
framing has two meanings the first one

1848
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,960
pertains to information presentation

1849
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:05,199
where certain aspects are accented and

1850
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:06,880
others de-emphasized

1851
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,880
imposing a particular point of view of

1852
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,560
or frame of reference

1853
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,560
a typical example is the proverbial

1854
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,560
glass framed as half-full

1855
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,760
or half-empty in other words framing is

1856
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,280
those bits of conclusion

1857
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,199
and judgment about characteristics of

1858
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:22,480
what is presented

1859
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:25,600
that would go otherwise unnoticed

1860
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,840
the second meaning of framing is about

1861
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,679
the adoption of a particular frame by

1862
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:31,120
the audience

1863
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:33,600
as we discussed with schemata when

1864
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,120
people perceive and evaluate

1865
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,679
comprehensive set of information

1866
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:39,440
they build simplified model that

1867
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,679
summarizes information they have already

1868
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:42,480
acquired

1869
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,159
in conclusions that they have already

1870
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:46,239
made then

1871
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:48,000
all new information is filtered

1872
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,440
throughout this model

1873
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:50,719
and different components of the

1874
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:53,760
situation classified according to it

1875
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,400
if the subject is new to a particular

1876
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:57,199
concept

1877
01:31:57,199 --> 01:31:59,040
the person will cognitively start

1878
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,719
building a new schemata

1879
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:03,120
and process all dependent information

1880
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:03,920
they received

1881
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:07,040
based on it while this cognitive process

1882
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,600
happens within the individual naturally

1883
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,000
as they are engaged in critical thinking

1884
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,400
it is also possible to push that model

1885
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,960
or frame of reference onto them where

1886
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:19,040
the information is oversimplified and

1887
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:19,760
delivered

1888
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:22,880
and later all additional information is

1889
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:23,679
streamed

1890
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:25,840
to fit and reinforce that particular

1891
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:28,719
model this process of simplification

1892
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:32,480
and providing a model is called framing

1893
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,639
now it becomes very clear how this can

1894
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:36,960
be exported for an influx operation

1895
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,199
by accentuating specific characteristics

1896
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:40,320
and

1897
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:43,679
suppressing others we can build a schema

1898
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:46,400
in one's mind that aligns with our goals

1899
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,840
so when critical information is

1900
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:48,639
delivered

1901
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:51,120
they will process it in a very specific

1902
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:55,840
way that we have predetermined

1903
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:03,199
so let's recap agenda setting tells the

1904
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:03,840
audience

1905
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,920
what is the topic and how important it

1906
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,800
is based on frequency of coverage

1907
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:11,440
priming sets how the audience will

1908
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:11,920
assess

1909
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,440
information presented to them and

1910
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,600
prepare certain narratives

1911
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:18,159
and framing accentuates some and

1912
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:18,960
suppresses

1913
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:21,600
other characteristics in order to shape

1914
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,760
the information in a particular way to

1915
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:24,159
match

1916
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:26,080
a particular point of view or

1917
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,600
established norm

1918
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,760
note that gatekeeping can also be used

1919
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,440
to tune the frame

1920
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,679
those effects play an essential role in

1921
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:34,960
cultivation

1922
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:37,600
cultivation itself is divided into first

1923
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,600
and second order effects

1924
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,840
the former also known as memory based

1925
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,280
effects

1926
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:45,440
as they heavily depend on the

1927
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:46,960
information which is already in

1928
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:49,120
recipients mind

1929
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,040
in those effects accessibility is

1930
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:53,840
critical in other words the faster

1931
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:56,000
and easier the information can be

1932
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,400
accessed the stronger the effect is

1933
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,560
which means that agenda setting and

1934
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,480
priming are crucial for the activation

1935
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,639
of those effects

1936
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:07,280
the second order effects describe how an

1937
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,520
individual will make a judgment in real

1938
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,840
time as new information is acquired

1939
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:14,080
this effect can be used for priming by

1940
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,920
introducing specific information when

1941
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,360
the person is not able

1942
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,960
to critically analyze uh analyze it by

1943
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,960
either making it sound unimportant and

1944
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,239
mention it in person

1945
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:26,080
or by introducing it at a time when the

1946
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:28,639
individual has diminished mental

1947
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:31,760
capacity or ability to process think

1948
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:32,239
about

1949
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:34,639
a tired person washing dishes while

1950
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:35,920
watching tv

1951
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,600
also think about the fast thinking

1952
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,760
process when it's engaged versus

1953
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:42,320
engaging the slow thinking process

1954
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:44,480
unlike the two-step flow of information

1955
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,880
which requires an intermediary

1956
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:50,000
the opinion leader cultivation is

1957
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,199
achieved directly

1958
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:54,239
primarily primarily through saturation

1959
01:34:54,239 --> 01:35:01,839
as is agenda setting priming and framing

1960
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:05,760
and now let's quickly change gears and

1961
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,920
look into a particular type of operation

1962
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:11,199
but first who is yuri besmanov also

1963
01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:13,280
known as thomas schumann

1964
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,280
he was a journalist with the soviet

1965
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:16,560
mainstream media

1966
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:19,760
the novelty or news press agency or

1967
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:22,960
to be precise this was his cover job

1968
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:24,960
when indeed he worked for the kgb on

1969
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,800
subversion operations

1970
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,400
he is one of the few detectors that give

1971
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,639
us an insight into the soviet era

1972
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:32,560
influence operations

1973
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,679
the operations take place take four

1974
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:36,480
steps

1975
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:40,000
demoralization stabilization crisis

1976
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,960
and normalization while some of those

1977
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,560
theories come from germany and the

1978
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:45,760
beginning of the century

1979
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:48,159
he gives a really good applied primer on

1980
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:50,080
how this is implemented in the real

1981
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,280
world

1982
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,520
he also talks about using the energy of

1983
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:54,320
the opponent

1984
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:55,679
instead of creating something which does

1985
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:58,480
not exist use existing natural tendency

1986
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:01,199
and feed them

1987
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,800
the first stage demoralization takes 15

1988
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,800
to 20 years or the time

1989
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,560
needed to educate one generation and

1990
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:15,920
shape of their mind and ideology

1991
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:18,080
in this stage the set of viewers are

1992
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,000
attacked for example religion is

1993
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:20,639
destroyed

1994
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:22,639
ridiculed and replaced with different

1995
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:25,119
codes and beliefs

1996
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:28,400
and education is

1997
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,400
modified where people are no longer

1998
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,080
learning um

1999
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:34,480
pragmatic and efficient things like stem

2000
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,639
or languages and instead they're taught

2001
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:39,520
natural foods green energy home economy

2002
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:42,000
your sexuality and so on

2003
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,080
in social life traditional institutions

2004
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:45,840
and organizations replaced with fake

2005
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:46,800
ones

2006
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,560
and initiatives and responsibilities

2007
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,639
taken away from the people

2008
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:54,159
power structures are replaced from being

2009
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:57,600
comprised of elected individuals to

2010
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,520
other bodies that are by appointment

2011
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:05,040
uh the image of law enforcement and

2012
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,679
the military is degraded and he gives an

2013
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:08,880
example of how

2014
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:11,440
older movies represent those categories

2015
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,760
very positively while the newer movies

2016
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:16,239
of the 80s mind he passed away in the

2017
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:17,360
early 90s

2018
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:20,400
the newer movies of the 80s um only so

2019
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,239
hatred and mistrust to the people that

2020
01:37:22,239 --> 01:37:24,560
protect us

2021
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,400
the second stage destabilization

2022
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,880
continues for 25 years

2023
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:32,080
and once society is more demoralized the

2024
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,080
focus can be narrowed to just a few

2025
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:37,519
things um

2026
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:40,159
because the others are already in decay

2027
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:41,360
in this

2028
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:45,440
phase human relations are radicalized uh

2029
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,920
create by creating a litigious society

2030
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:49,679
and antagonistic one

2031
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:52,239
and the division is further fueled by

2032
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:54,320
different ngos and other subversive

2033
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,080
organizations

2034
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:59,119
in the third phase crisis

2035
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:02,239
a crisis is created which can be the

2036
01:38:02,239 --> 01:38:03,360
result of a massive

2037
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:06,560
unrest um or other factors

2038
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:08,560
and society can no longer function

2039
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:11,040
normally this phase continues

2040
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:14,639
up to six weeks then the final

2041
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:16,960
stage normalization settles and this is

2042
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,639
when the tanks are all in this is when

2043
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:19,840
the military

2044
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:23,679
uh takes over in soviet era this would

2045
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:25,119
be the russian tanks

2046
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:28,159
going in another country and occupying

2047
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:28,719
it

2048
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:31,920
uh helping the oppressed

2049
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:34,560
proletariat who were fighting against

2050
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,080
the oppressors

2051
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,320
um but very soon it becomes apparent

2052
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:40,320
that everybody is oppressed

2053
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:43,040
and um all those social justice warriors

2054
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:44,159
that were

2055
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:46,080
facilitating the russian operations

2056
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,280
before that

2057
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,600
would actually be on a hit list and very

2058
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:50,719
soon will be

2059
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:54,400
exterminated uh or put in jail

2060
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:58,560
so this is kind of what the um

2061
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,639
subversion playbook looks like now not

2062
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:02,239
that also the term social justice

2063
01:39:02,239 --> 01:39:04,080
warrior is not something new it actually

2064
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,719
comes from that

2065
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:13,840
book

2066
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,679
so where am i going with this remember

2067
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:18,880
in demoralization and

2068
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:20,400
civilization we talked about the

2069
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:23,360
radicalization of human relationships

2070
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:25,199
also remember when i spoke about the

2071
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:27,679
echo chambers and how an adversary may

2072
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:30,560
need to feed different camps in order to

2073
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:31,920
create

2074
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:33,840
greater segregation and polarization in

2075
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,280
society

2076
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:36,320
let's look at something we can

2077
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,480
objectively measure the division across

2078
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,560
political party lines

2079
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:44,080
to do this will use the results of a

2080
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:44,960
study

2081
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:48,800
which has been run repeatedly since 1994

2082
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:52,080
with a sample of over 5 000 people here

2083
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,360
you can see how democrats and

2084
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:55,360
republicans

2085
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,600
answered common questions pertaining to

2086
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:59,199
government race

2087
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:01,280
immigration national security

2088
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:03,840
environmental protection in other areas

2089
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:07,119
and the changes over years you can see

2090
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:10,239
how division accelerates and later

2091
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:12,159
reaches record levels during obama

2092
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:14,000
administration and further spreads a

2093
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,280
little more during the trump

2094
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,480
administration

2095
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:20,400
just fyi 2017 was the last year when

2096
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:23,760
um this study was around so it would be

2097
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,840
kind of interesting to see what the

2098
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,040
results are

2099
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:30,400
nowadays um so is this a natural

2100
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:31,040
phenomena

2101
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:34,960
or is it uh created uh by an adversary

2102
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:38,320
well let's look at it again and mark the

2103
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,400
starting medians for both parties and

2104
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,159
see how their perspective

2105
01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:51,839
respective populations change

2106
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:02,840
now look at how much each of them

2107
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:04,960
changed

2108
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,440
also note how the center moved it was

2109
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,040
here

2110
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:12,400
and now it is here also look at how the

2111
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:13,199
blue area

2112
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:15,920
has moved so far left it is close to the

2113
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:17,360
boundary

2114
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:21,440
and it is almost not present here

2115
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:24,320
look at its new shape as well does this

2116
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:26,080
appear natural to you

2117
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:28,000
or are there nefarious driving forces

2118
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,280
behind it

2119
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:30,719
i won't give you the answer but i'll

2120
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:33,119
show you where to look to do so

2121
01:41:33,119 --> 01:41:35,199
we'll need to map the different midi

2122
01:41:35,199 --> 01:41:36,880
effects that could create this

2123
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:40,239
and see who controls the levers so let's

2124
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:47,839
do some forensics

2125
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:52,239
what does this remind you of it looks

2126
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:54,080
like everyone has mostly the same

2127
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:55,760
opinion about all topics

2128
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:57,679
and there are small number of dissenting

2129
01:41:57,679 --> 01:41:59,119
opinions

2130
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:00,800
what media effects contribute to the

2131
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,639
lack of descending opinions

2132
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:04,960
what is this well this is an echo

2133
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:06,080
chamber

2134
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:09,040
how was it created well through agenda

2135
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:09,760
setting

2136
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:13,360
gatekeeping cultivation and spiral of

2137
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:15,119
silence

2138
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:17,440
now think about it who controls the

2139
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,119
agenda

2140
01:42:19,119 --> 01:42:22,880
who can apply gatekeeping effectively

2141
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:26,239
well you know the answer you remember

2142
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:28,080
and remember what was the mainstream

2143
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:29,360
media equivalent

2144
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:32,000
uh for gatekeeping in social networks

2145
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:32,960
precisely

2146
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,719
spiral of silence this is where your

2147
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:37,760
russian bots may be coming into a play

2148
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:40,719
now draw parallel remember the lasers

2149
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:41,199
failed

2150
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:44,400
drug study i talked about remember

2151
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,480
how all doctors spontaneously started

2152
01:42:46,480 --> 01:42:48,000
prescribing the same drug

2153
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,719
due to the exposure to a limited set of

2154
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:52,159
information sources

2155
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:55,119
now think about mainstream media and the

2156
01:42:55,119 --> 01:42:57,840
limited number of major networks

2157
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:00,080
that are available can you see the

2158
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,239
parallel

2159
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:04,880
now that we figured out uh how this

2160
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:05,360
happened

2161
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:08,800
and who owns the media effects controls

2162
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,960
we should probably investigate who owns

2163
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:12,960
the media outlets themselves

2164
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:14,320
well but let's leave this to another

2165
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:17,440
talk now to summarize

2166
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:20,159
we saw how society has polarized over

2167
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:21,679
the past 12 years

2168
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:23,760
how the democratic party supporters have

2169
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:24,880
significantly moved

2170
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:28,080
left and how as a result the center has

2171
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:28,639
moved

2172
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:38,960
to the left as well

2173
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:40,639
we just looked at the pew research

2174
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:42,639
institute study measuring how

2175
01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:45,280
government religious observance national

2176
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:46,159
security

2177
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:49,199
education racing immigration

2178
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:51,520
environment protection and other areas

2179
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:53,600
have changed over the years

2180
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,239
now let's remember the bismiano

2181
01:43:56,239 --> 01:43:58,400
subversion model

2182
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:00,400
what were the peers attacked during the

2183
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:02,639
demoralization phase

2184
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:06,880
well exactly administration religion

2185
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:09,600
military and law enforcement educational

2186
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:10,400
system

2187
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:14,560
social life labor and employer relations

2188
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:17,360
more or less they overlap so can we use

2189
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:18,239
this study

2190
01:44:18,239 --> 01:44:19,840
as a measurement of the level of

2191
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:22,719
demoralization or probably

2192
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:25,280
just a reminder don't confuse the ttps

2193
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:26,719
for the attacker

2194
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:28,560
the fact we call this the bismillah

2195
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,000
version model

2196
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,159
doesn't mean that only the kgb is

2197
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:33,440
allowed to use it

2198
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,600
as a matter of fact a war of this theory

2199
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,119
came from germany from the beginning of

2200
01:44:37,119 --> 01:44:38,639
the last century

2201
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:42,080
so it can be implemented by any nation

2202
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:45,040
or nation state or privately funded

2203
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:46,400
organization

2204
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:49,040
having said that you know what the media

2205
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:49,600
effects

2206
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:52,159
are you know what the adversary would be

2207
01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:52,800
attacking

2208
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:55,440
in a subversion operation so start

2209
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:56,000
looking at

2210
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,639
modern news in modern times and see

2211
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:00,239
what's being intact

2212
01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:03,600
and how similar operations

2213
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:07,840
are conducted right now at beginning

2214
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:10,880
just one note look for the

2215
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:15,040
different viewers that they're attacking

2216
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:17,440
and ignore the pretext or the

2217
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:18,719
justification

2218
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:23,040
that they're using to attack those

2219
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:28,480
and now let's quickly look at a real

2220
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:30,320
life example of a campaign

2221
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:32,000
as motherland politics are highly

2222
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,159
contentious i'll pick something old and

2223
01:45:34,159 --> 01:45:35,520
well understood

2224
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:38,560
the weather underground wait wait wait

2225
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:41,760
wrong logo this is what happens when you

2226
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:42,080
do

2227
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,600
quick research without fully

2228
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,360
understanding the topic

2229
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:48,719
this one the weather underground or the

2230
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:50,719
weatherman was a subversive communist

2231
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:51,520
organization

2232
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:53,679
designated by the fbi as a domestic

2233
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:54,880
terrorist group

2234
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:56,880
in an attempt to drive their political

2235
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:58,960
agenda they conducted

2236
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:01,679
a number of bombings including against

2237
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:03,280
the buildings of the u.s capital the

2238
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:04,719
pentagon

2239
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:07,280
department of state building as well as

2240
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:08,000
a number of

2241
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
arsons and riots does that sound

2242
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,840
familiar

2243
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:14,000
even went as far out to issue a

2244
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,600
declaration of war against the us

2245
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:16,639
government

2246
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:18,800
their agenda was changing and changing

2247
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:21,199
the social and economic relations

2248
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:23,040
something that they called institut

2249
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:25,040
institutionalized racism

2250
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,280
which they never define but use the

2251
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:28,719
phrase very liberally

2252
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:30,880
to mean many things which have nothing

2253
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:31,840
to do with skin

2254
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:34,480
color or race they have their manifesto

2255
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:35,040
code

2256
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:37,920
purifier which features a highly

2257
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:39,440
divisive narrative

2258
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:41,520
framing everything a struggle of the

2259
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,360
oppressed versus the oppressor

2260
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:45,360
attacking law and order is a construct

2261
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:46,960
of imperialism

2262
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:48,960
attacking the family unit as sexist and

2263
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,119
oppressive as well as

2264
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:53,440
they talk about insurgency militancy and

2265
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:54,719
other violent means

2266
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:56,960
to fulfill their agenda i highly

2267
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:58,880
recommend reading some of the texts to

2268
01:46:58,880 --> 01:46:59,600
see how good

2269
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:02,000
intentions are used to frame extremely

2270
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,360
destructive behavior

2271
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:05,600
also note this is not a u.s centric

2272
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:07,679
problem this is an example of how

2273
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:09,600
narrative can be used to frame any

2274
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:11,600
positive belief system into a subversive

2275
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:13,920
weapon

2276
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:18,800
so after this charged topic let's go

2277
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:21,119
back to the proverbial russian bots

2278
01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:23,520
we can't just count those and say oh

2279
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,400
well

2280
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,800
we have three kilos of bots therefore it

2281
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,639
must be that country

2282
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:30,960
we need to understand what the type of

2283
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:31,840
the operation

2284
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:34,719
is and what they're really after is it

2285
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:36,800
pure cultivation or are they trying to

2286
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:38,560
prime the population for a particular

2287
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:40,159
message which will be delivered in a

2288
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:41,360
different way

2289
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:43,520
or are they there to suppress other

2290
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:45,520
voices and set the agenda

2291
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:47,920
are they there to push diversif

2292
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:49,280
narrative

2293
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:51,840
how about ads are they there to convince

2294
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,719
people to vote one way or another

2295
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:57,920
or we already saw the

2296
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:01,040
hypodermic hypodermic needle theory is

2297
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:02,719
not very effective

2298
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:04,320
could they be there just to set the

2299
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,080
agenda so we can talk about

2300
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,239
russian influence in the election and

2301
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:10,239
prime people to think that the elections

2302
01:48:10,239 --> 01:48:11,920
are rick

2303
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:13,920
if we answer in the affirmative to the

2304
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,440
second question

2305
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:17,760
now we are talking about passive

2306
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:19,840
information operation

2307
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,000
regardless without understanding the

2308
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,600
goals of the campaign

2309
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:27,520
it is not possible to counter it effect

2310
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:31,520
i hope this talk was interesting and

2311
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:33,520
gave you an insight and perspective into

2312
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:35,760
the complexities and interdependencies

2313
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:38,480
of the human mind and perception going

2314
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:40,960
back to the russian bots and the ira

2315
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:42,639
it is important to understand that the

2316
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:44,560
operation was not about buying ads for

2317
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:46,480
either of the contenders but it was

2318
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:48,480
rather to spin the narrative so security

2319
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,320
researchers can talk about how

2320
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:53,199
the russians influenced the elections

2321
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:55,199
this is also called passive information

2322
01:48:55,199 --> 01:48:56,159
operation

2323
01:48:56,159 --> 01:48:59,679
but more on this topic in another talk

2324
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:01,520
as security researchers we need to be

2325
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:03,600
cognizant and aware that we may be the

2326
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:05,679
tools of a foreign nation by running a

2327
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:08,159
narrative

2328
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:10,960
thanks everyone i just wanted to note

2329
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:11,840

2373
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:46,080
am also a professor at pennsylvania

2374
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:48,159
state university

2375

and also have a charity called friends

2376
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,800
charity where we give out scholarships

2377
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:53,119
to

2378
01:50:53,119 --> 01:50:56,400
high school students who really need

2379
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:59,599
that money in my free time i uh brew

2380
01:50:59,599 --> 01:51:03,520
beer hey my name is james potter i'm a

2381
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:04,800
principal engineer

2382
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:07,040
working with raja i've been in cyber

2383
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:09,280
security for

2384
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:11,679
about 12 years now and most of the time

2385
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:12,880
has been spent doing

2386
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:15,119
forensics and instant response and

2387
01:51:15,119 --> 01:51:17,199
threat intelligence

2388
01:51:17,199 --> 01:51:19,199
in my free time i enjoy being a dad so

2389
01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:20,719
we travel a lot with the kids

2390
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:23,840
and do a lot of attendance of irish

2391
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:24,800
dancing when i'm not

2392
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:28,080
not doing cyber security work

2393
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:31,599
so jumping into the presentation here we

2394
01:51:31,599 --> 01:51:33,920
we chose the subject of of reporting

2395
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:35,520
it's it's not the most glamorous thing

2396
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:36,320
usually but

2397
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:38,320
it's one of the most it's typically the

2398
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:39,520
most time-consuming

2399
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,520
uh portion of instant response and it's

2400
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:42,639
often one of the

2401
01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:43,920
components that is given the least

2402
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:45,840
amount of time for for an instant

2403
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:48,320
responder to produce

2404
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:50,320
and usually what we we see after we've

2405
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:52,000
written these these reports

2406
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:56,960
is they range from from

2407
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:58,800
a report that's taken you an

2408
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:00,639
investigation that's taken

2409
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:03,599
several days to to complete to something

2410
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:05,599
that's taken just a few minutes

2411
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:07,440
uh and what we usually see is once these

2412
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:09,679
reports are done they get handed to

2413
01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:11,199
the people that were directly involved

2414
01:52:11,199 --> 01:52:13,040
with the event and then

2415
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:14,320
um they usually don't see the light of

2416
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:16,320
dating anymore

2417
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,639
so one of our key goals was to evolve

2418
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:20,560
the handling of reporting

2419
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:23,119
and what we wanted to do was add more of

2420
01:52:23,119 --> 01:52:24,880
a narrative into the reports

2421
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,400
and making the material more engaging to

2422
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:28,320
the audience so

2423
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:31,360
move slowly away from having um

2424
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:33,920
your your pure evidence-based reporting

2425
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:35,040
where it's

2426
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:38,000
it's it it ranges it looks like where

2427
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,400
the the content usually just has

2428
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,400
we were notified of anomalous activity

2429
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:44,239
we found the anomalous activity and we

2430
01:52:44,239 --> 01:52:45,199
stopped the anomalous

2431
01:52:45,199 --> 01:52:47,119
anomalous activity and then sometimes we

2432
01:52:47,119 --> 01:52:48,480
prevented the activity for the future

2433
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:49,280
right

2434
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:52,159
um but the reports don't usually go down

2435
01:52:52,159 --> 01:52:53,920
that that who what when where and why

2436
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:57,280
of of uh of

2437
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:00,719
the giving the extra information on what

2438
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:03,199
kind of theories the responder had

2439
01:53:03,199 --> 01:53:05,199
uh what dead ends they ran to what types

2440
01:53:05,199 --> 01:53:06,239
of failures they had what types of

2441
01:53:06,239 --> 01:53:08,080
successes they had and what rabbit holes

2442
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:10,840
uh instant responder usually experiences

2443
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:12,080
um

2444
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:15,119
so as we're we're talking about how to

2445
01:53:15,119 --> 01:53:16,880
to get some more engagement and and this

2446
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:17,840
is previous to

2447
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:20,639
to the pandemic uh we wanted to to get

2448
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:22,080
more of the the faces of

2449
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:25,440
of the uh the responders and

2450
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:27,360
have it so more could be heard about

2451
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:28,800
them so it's not just about

2452
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:31,760
a a metric of of what you've responded

2453
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:34,080
to and like you know we've we've had

2454
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:37,679
we've had x amount of of of alert type

2455
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:39,679
of alert type one and they they

2456
01:53:39,679 --> 01:53:41,119
responded to these things we wanted to

2457
01:53:41,119 --> 01:53:42,719
have more of that information around it

2458
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:44,320
and more knowledge share

2459
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:46,400
and to get people more more in front of

2460
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:47,440
of the

2461
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:51,440
activity so a long time ago before i got

2462
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:51,760
into

2463
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:53,040
cybersecurity when i was studying

2464
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:54,800
college i was originally studying to

2465
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:55,760
become a teacher

2466
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:57,840
and i recalled a early childhood

2467
01:53:57,840 --> 01:53:59,119
creative writing technique called a

2468
01:53:59,119 --> 01:54:00,400
story wheel

2469
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:02,159
the story wheel is a utility usually

2470
01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:03,760
used for younger kids that

2471
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:07,199
has pie pieces and a kid

2472
01:54:07,199 --> 01:54:10,400
would color in the the pieces to each of

2473
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:12,880
the pie to highlight the the key the key

2474
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:14,800
events to the story they want to tell

2475
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:17,920
or if they're doing a book report uh

2476
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:19,280
the key events that occurred in the

2477
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:22,000
story that they want to summarize

2478
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,080
so while i was explaining this to raj of

2479
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:25,920
the whole concept of behind a story

2480
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:26,639
wheel

2481
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:28,000
it occurred to us that there is a

2482
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,719
another similar framework

2483
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:34,560
that is leveraged by a

2484
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:36,480
show creator called dan dan harmon um

2485
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:38,320
the tv show that he

2486
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:39,679
one of the shows that's very popular

2487
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:41,520
here in the us is called rick and morty

2488
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:44,960
um and this this framework that he uses

2489
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:47,760
the show the the the show always follows

2490
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,679
the same type of storytelling method no

2491
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:51,599
matter which episode it is the the show

2492
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:53,440
goes to the same type of thing

2493
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:56,719
and his his uh framework is called a a

2494
01:54:56,719 --> 01:55:00,400
story wheel or sorry story circle so

2495
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:03,440
a story circle always goes through the

2496
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:05,520
same repeatable method of telling a

2497
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:07,040
story so it makes it more relatable to

2498
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:09,280
the audience it starts with you

2499
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:11,599
goes through the cycle of need go search

2500
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:12,320
find

2501
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:14,960
take return and then you you go through

2502
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:16,320
your change

2503
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:19,119
so for example if i was going to tell us

2504
01:55:19,119 --> 01:55:20,400
about like a

2505
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:23,599
everyday um for an instant responder

2506
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:24,560
like the everyday activity that you

2507
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:26,400
would go through like a single point in

2508
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:27,920
time i would say you are the instant

2509
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:29,119
responder

2510
01:55:29,119 --> 01:55:31,119
you want to the need is you want to

2511
01:55:31,119 --> 01:55:33,440
increase your visibility of work

2512
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:36,800
you you you spend you face a piece of

2513
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:38,080
malware that you've never seen before as

2514
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:39,360
your go

2515
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:41,599
you spend hours digging into the malware

2516
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:44,840
you find new ttps and indicators

2517
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:47,840
you take by realizing that there's a big

2518
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,480
impact

2519
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:52,480
on on discovering that

2520
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:54,159
the malware has impacted your

2521
01:55:54,159 --> 01:55:55,920
environment and you

2522
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:57,440
it went through a lot of effort to have

2523
01:55:57,440 --> 01:56:00,080
it mitigated you return with the

2524
01:56:00,080 --> 01:56:02,480
the event resolved and then you got

2525
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:04,080
you've grown as an instant responder so

2526
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:05,760
that's a really generic way

2527
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:08,639
of summarizing the story but what we

2528
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:09,599
want to do

2529
01:56:09,599 --> 01:56:12,000
is for the rest of this presentation is

2530
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,239
walk everybody through how we

2531
01:56:14,239 --> 01:56:17,760
we took this journey of of

2532
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:20,719
modifying our reports and adding more

2533
01:56:20,719 --> 01:56:22,239
more than just a singular

2534
01:56:22,239 --> 01:56:25,440
like one event that we use a report for

2535
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:28,000
and and use multiple templates but the

2536
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,119
rest of this is going to be following

2537
01:56:29,119 --> 01:56:30,719
the same story circle

2538
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:31,679
and it take everybody through the

2539
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:36,480
journey of what we went through in 2020

2540
01:56:37,199 --> 01:56:40,239
so with that thanks james uh with that

2541
01:56:40,239 --> 01:56:42,239
you know let's talk about the first one

2542
01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:44,000
the comfort zone

2543
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,639
this is the pre pandemic when we were

2544
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:47,599
all sitting in the

2545
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:50,080
office shoulder surfing talking about

2546
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:50,960
different cases

2547
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:53,760
or events uh it's easier right when you

2548
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:55,199
can go grab coffee or

2549
01:56:55,199 --> 01:56:57,760
lunch and talk to your teammates or your

2550
01:56:57,760 --> 01:56:58,800
leadership team

2551
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:02,000
about the incidents that happen

2552
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,719
whether it's you know in the elevator or

2553
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:06,080
walking down

2554
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:09,360
the hall when there's a smaller incident

2555
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:10,719
or a case

2556
01:57:10,719 --> 01:57:12,320
and there's a report that's needed to be

2557
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:14,000
written you can just turn around talk to

2558
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:14,960
your teammates

2559
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:18,400
and write that report but when there's a

2560
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:18,960
bigger

2561
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:22,800
incident everybody is in the same room

2562
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:26,560
or adjacent rooms can gather together

2563
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:28,320
and write out this report and

2564
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:29,599
collaborate

2565
01:57:29,599 --> 01:57:33,199
together we become too comfortable with

2566
01:57:33,199 --> 01:57:36,560
what we are currently doing so as

2567
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:39,280
an example is we'll use james's example

2568
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:39,760
of

2569
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:41,599
the malware so if there's a malware

2570
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:44,800
event you can talk to your teammates

2571
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:47,599
and you can resolve the event right

2572
01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:49,119
there and then you don't have to pick up

2573
01:57:49,119 --> 01:57:49,679
the phone

2574
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:52,880
and call many people so but

2575
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:54,960
as we're sitting there we get too

2576
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:56,320
comfortable with

2577
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,320
all the events that are happening we're

2578
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,000
just day in day out

2579
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,800
we're just getting too comfortable but

2580
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:03,199
as an

2581
01:58:03,199 --> 01:58:06,400
analyst or as the leader we always

2582
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:07,199
desire

2583
01:58:07,199 --> 01:58:10,320
for something new we want to get better

2584
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:12,880
on what we're doing instead of sitting

2585
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:14,639
there and talking about the same

2586
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:18,800
incidents so as we want to get

2587
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:21,520
better what we want this something new

2588
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:22,639
is i wanna

2589
01:58:22,639 --> 01:58:25,920
james on the next slide

2590
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:29,599
so as we're desiring for something new

2591
01:58:29,599 --> 01:58:30,159
this is

2592
01:58:30,159 --> 01:58:33,440
it can be called as a midlife crisis or

2593
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:36,880
you know a midlife analyst crisis

2594
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:39,360
you want some excitement in your day you

2595
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,280
want new trainings or you want vendor

2596
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:42,639
trainings without the marketing

2597
01:58:42,639 --> 01:58:43,920
materials you want

2598
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:45,760
technical team trainings you want

2599
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:46,960
mentorship

2600
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:48,880
by your senior team members you want a

2601
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:50,000
training path

2602
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
to move forward and move up in the

2603
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,840
organization

2604
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:55,599
most importantly you want to know the

2605
01:58:55,599 --> 01:58:57,520
direction your team is going

2606
01:58:57,520 --> 01:58:59,440
and the project that's being worked on

2607
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:01,199
so if you take that same malware

2608
01:59:01,199 --> 01:59:03,280
example would be like you want to

2609
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:04,800
de-offscate that power

2610
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:09,199
have a malware lab that you can play in

2611
01:59:09,199 --> 01:59:12,000
but as we're desiring for all this and

2612
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:12,719
we're you know

2613
01:59:12,719 --> 01:59:15,760
in the zone of pre-pandemic something

2614
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:16,400
happens

2615
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:19,520
2020 happened and

2616
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:21,920
since 2020 happened we know the pandemic

2617
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:22,800
happened and

2618
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:26,719
everything changed we went from being

2619
01:59:26,719 --> 01:59:29,679
at work with all your teammates to being

2620
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:30,400
now

2621
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:33,679
in separate locations so not only you

2622
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:34,320
have to pay

2623
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:37,760
100 of your attention towards your home

2624
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:39,440
life and everything that the chaos

2625
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:39,760
that's

2626
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:41,920
happening at home you have to do that

2627
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:43,440
same thing

2628
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:45,440
at work you have to pay attention with

2629
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:46,880
everything that's happening you gotta

2630
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:47,679
pay attention

2631
01:59:47,679 --> 01:59:50,000
at work that's where we don't know

2632
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,599
what's gonna happen if your

2633
01:59:51,599 --> 01:59:53,360
kids are crying you gotta teach your

2634
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:55,360
kids you know

2635
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:58,880
you get into this mental stress

2636
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:01,360
so what do we really need to do when we

2637
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:03,679
have this mental stress do we

2638
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:06,639
adapt to our mental stress or do we

2639
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:07,280
change

2640
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:11,040
ourselves and this is this is where we

2641
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:13,119
we uh

2642
02:00:13,119 --> 02:00:15,840
when we with the pandemic it accelerated

2643
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:16,480
our

2644
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:18,719
our desires to to get something in place

2645
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:19,599
because

2646
02:00:19,599 --> 02:00:22,719
the information um

2647
02:00:22,719 --> 02:00:24,719
traditionally within within a you know

2648
02:00:24,719 --> 02:00:26,560
cybersecurity operations team

2649
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:27,679
the a lot of the knowledge is

2650
02:00:27,679 --> 02:00:29,440
transferred through you know oral

2651
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:31,599
history so it's like

2652
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:34,159
if you if you can't really see things a

2653
02:00:34,159 --> 02:00:35,360
lot of things are told through verbal

2654
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:36,159
stories

2655
02:00:36,159 --> 02:00:37,360
so we wanted to really get that

2656
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:40,159
historical context back down onto paper

2657
02:00:40,159 --> 02:00:42,239
and with everybody being virtually one

2658
02:00:42,239 --> 02:00:44,159
we needed to and not just not just our

2659
02:00:44,159 --> 02:00:45,520
own teams like so our

2660
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:47,360
our teams if you're even if your own

2661
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:48,560
team last year was

2662
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:50,800
was virtual there there's probably still

2663
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:52,560
components within the organization that

2664
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:54,159
were working in an office and what

2665
02:00:54,159 --> 02:00:55,599
happened last year is

2666
02:00:55,599 --> 02:00:57,520
everything went virtual so it changed it

2667
02:00:57,520 --> 02:00:58,639
put everything on its head

2668
02:00:58,639 --> 02:01:01,520
of of not just taking the normal remote

2669
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:03,679
work that you have

2670
02:01:03,679 --> 02:01:06,080
in one way it took it so everything had

2671
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:06,960
changed that way

2672
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:10,239
so what we wanted to do was initiate um

2673
02:01:10,239 --> 02:01:13,280
some change by by raising the gates and

2674
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:13,760
we

2675
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:16,400
we viewed getting those stories of of

2676
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:17,840
reporting into the

2677
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:19,760
as a way to raise the gates and we

2678
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:21,920
wanted to take reports and make them so

2679
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:23,520
it's not just

2680
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:26,000
um generic where it looks it does it

2681
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,679
reflects just the organization but we

2682
02:01:27,679 --> 02:01:28,960
also wanted to reflect the

2683
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:32,239
the analysts work so that way when the

2684
02:01:32,239 --> 02:01:34,639
there there's ownership there when they

2685
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:36,719
produce report and it also has

2686
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:39,760
has our voice behind it we view this as

2687
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:41,679
a way of also wanting to adapt

2688
02:01:41,679 --> 02:01:45,520
to improving the communication

2689
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:48,880
and not just using uh reports for

2690
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:51,920
for big events but also using them for

2691
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:52,880
some of the smaller

2692
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:55,920
smaller types of investigations

2693
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:58,159
yeah it's taking so how do we take our

2694
02:01:58,159 --> 02:01:59,199
analysts and

2695
02:01:59,199 --> 02:02:02,800
you know showcase the cool incidents

2696
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:03,599
that they're

2697
02:02:03,599 --> 02:02:05,679
working on you know instead of just

2698
02:02:05,679 --> 02:02:07,520
putting in the chat or

2699
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:09,520
before pandemic is turning around and

2700
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:11,440
talking to your teammates about

2701
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:13,119
something cool that they're working on

2702
02:02:13,119 --> 02:02:15,360
how do we make them the hero

2703
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:19,199
of the story so we really want to like

2704
02:02:19,199 --> 02:02:22,000
vocalize that so where our analysts that

2705
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:22,880
are working

2706
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:25,040
are the heroes of the stories that

2707
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:26,800
they're writing and communicating

2708
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:29,119
out they're the ones that are going to

2709
02:02:29,119 --> 02:02:30,480
be standing in front

2710
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:34,159
of the leaders presenting this

2711
02:02:34,159 --> 02:02:36,400
and the other way to that we we viewed

2712
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:37,840
the use of reports

2713
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:40,719
is we want to be very similar to like

2714
02:02:40,719 --> 02:02:42,400
what your traditional red teams produce

2715
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:45,119
where the analysts have seen seen the

2716
02:02:45,119 --> 02:02:46,719
actual threat so it's not a perceived

2717
02:02:46,719 --> 02:02:47,199
threat

2718
02:02:47,199 --> 02:02:49,119
that can happen from a threat briefing

2719
02:02:49,119 --> 02:02:50,320
that could come from your intelligence

2720
02:02:50,320 --> 02:02:51,199
teams

2721
02:02:51,199 --> 02:02:53,199
or something it's something that's

2722
02:02:53,199 --> 02:02:54,239
already happened

2723
02:02:54,239 --> 02:02:56,159
and to do those burn downs with other

2724
02:02:56,159 --> 02:02:57,280
other teams

2725
02:02:57,280 --> 02:02:58,800
but one of the key things too with

2726
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:00,800
inserting the uh

2727
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:04,000
the analyst into the story is we want to

2728
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,119
be able to write things

2729
02:03:05,119 --> 02:03:06,719
have have templates that they could

2730
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:08,560
follow that that

2731
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:10,880
allows the information to be at the

2732
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:12,239
level of the audience

2733
02:03:12,239 --> 02:03:15,839
they're presenting to

2734
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:20,719
so one of the things we looked at

2735
02:03:20,719 --> 02:03:24,560
was producing something that had a

2736
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:26,080
more of a cadence so like looking at

2737
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:28,080
your target audience of of

2738
02:03:28,080 --> 02:03:30,239
your managers and your senior leadership

2739
02:03:30,239 --> 02:03:31,760
so

2740
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:35,280
we we wanted to have more

2741
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:38,880
information out there that allows you to

2742
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:41,280
we use lv or speech style where if

2743
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:43,199
you're not familiar with that it's

2744
02:03:43,199 --> 02:03:45,760
if you got on an elevator with uh with

2745
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:46,880
an executive or

2746
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:49,760
a senior leader um and you only have the

2747
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:51,760
time it takes you to get from

2748
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:53,520
from one floor to the floor that that

2749
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:55,599
individual is going to

2750
02:03:55,599 --> 02:03:58,079
how can you how can you convey to that

2751
02:03:58,079 --> 02:03:58,960
person

2752
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:02,079
um what what you did what

2753
02:04:02,079 --> 02:04:05,679
what sorry what happened what we've done

2754
02:04:05,679 --> 02:04:06,480
so far

2755
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:08,880
and what what we're working on already

2756
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:10,719
so so they asked you you can get that

2757
02:04:10,719 --> 02:04:12,400
quick information out so that

2758
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:14,960
that made us uh we created a a summary

2759
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:16,719
report that's just a quick one pager

2760
02:04:16,719 --> 02:04:18,079
that gets the summary of the incident

2761
02:04:18,079 --> 02:04:18,800
out there

2762
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:22,239
and we created cadences that

2763
02:04:22,239 --> 02:04:23,840
depending on the level of the event

2764
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:25,360
establish a a

2765
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:26,880
time frame in which those that

2766
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:30,960
information can can be delivered

2767
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:33,840
and even the pre-pandemic right any of

2768
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:34,159
the

2769
02:04:34,159 --> 02:04:36,159
incidents that are always worked on are

2770
02:04:36,159 --> 02:04:38,000
usually bigger incidents

2771
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,400
where you have these formal reports

2772
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:41,599
right that you will still

2773
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:44,800
write even going through the pandemic of

2774
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:47,119
you know having the giant incident

2775
02:04:47,119 --> 02:04:48,880
summary that has all the details the

2776
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:50,480
detailed timelines

2777
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:52,320
the screenshots you know the work that

2778
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:54,000
was performed

2779
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,079
for that incident and any of the gaps

2780
02:04:56,079 --> 02:04:57,040
that are identified

2781
02:04:57,040 --> 02:04:59,679
and how to remediate those gaps but we

2782
02:04:59,679 --> 02:05:01,040
want to start sparking

2783
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:03,199
that conversation between analysts or

2784
02:05:03,199 --> 02:05:04,880
between even your day shift or

2785
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:08,159
night shift and midships to have this

2786
02:05:08,159 --> 02:05:11,040
elevator styles reports or these one

2787
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:12,880
pagers so if an analyst

2788
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:15,119
worked on an incident they if they

2789
02:05:15,119 --> 02:05:16,639
annotate everything

2790
02:05:16,639 --> 02:05:19,199
on what happened the risk and what

2791
02:05:19,199 --> 02:05:20,880
they're doing to mitigate the risk as

2792
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:23,679
the next analyst comes on board can

2793
02:05:23,679 --> 02:05:25,679
always

2794
02:05:25,679 --> 02:05:28,159
know what's happening what was happening

2795
02:05:28,159 --> 02:05:29,599
and what they need to do

2796
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:32,639
in their in their shift plus this really

2797
02:05:32,639 --> 02:05:34,000
helps with

2798
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:37,679
uh as you're onboarding new colleagues

2799
02:05:37,679 --> 02:05:39,840
so as you onboard new colleagues they

2800
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:41,599
can go back and read through these

2801
02:05:41,599 --> 02:05:42,800
reports to see

2802
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:45,199
the work that's being performed by the

2803
02:05:45,199 --> 02:05:46,400
team

2804
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:48,960
and what type of incidents are being

2805
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:49,679
response

2806
02:05:49,679 --> 02:05:53,440
responded by the analysts

2807
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:57,599
but then as you're writing these

2808
02:05:57,599 --> 02:06:00,880
reports right you start taking ownership

2809
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:04,400
of your security posture so you try to

2810
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:08,239
drive your own car

2811
02:06:08,239 --> 02:06:11,440
you know how to secure it because you're

2812
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:12,560
the owner

2813
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:16,480
of those reports those cases that you

2814
02:06:16,480 --> 02:06:20,239
worked on the details that go within it

2815
02:06:20,239 --> 02:06:24,320
you're the one that is responsible

2816
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:28,320
to share that among your leaders

2817
02:06:29,199 --> 02:06:31,599
and one of the the other thing with with

2818
02:06:31,599 --> 02:06:32,719
uh

2819
02:06:32,719 --> 02:06:35,679
adding more the voice the the the

2820
02:06:35,679 --> 02:06:36,960
analysts from the reports

2821
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:39,360
is we want we want to establish more

2822
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:41,040
time for a skill of needing to

2823
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:44,480
have uh more more creative writing

2824
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:47,199
um to be able to add what we're saying

2825
02:06:47,199 --> 02:06:48,320
with the reports

2826
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:50,800
we want it's it's adding more of the the

2827
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:52,239
voice so adding more

2828
02:06:52,239 --> 02:06:55,440
more narrative to it so it's if i was if

2829
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:56,960
i was going to explain to you what was

2830
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:58,159
what's happening i can use a lot of

2831
02:06:58,159 --> 02:06:58,960
analogies

2832
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:01,840
and make sure that it it applies to the

2833
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:03,520
audience i'm giving it to

2834
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:07,440
so now when something goes on

2835
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:09,599
especially that's being virtual it gives

2836
02:07:09,599 --> 02:07:11,360
a point of contact so that person

2837
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:16,880
can be is they they they have

2838
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:18,400
they get they get credit for the work

2839
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:20,320
they they've worked on

2840
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:23,119
um but the other portion of it now is

2841
02:07:23,119 --> 02:07:24,159
that with having to

2842
02:07:24,159 --> 02:07:25,520
write more reports there's more than

2843
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:27,440
just inserting information into

2844
02:07:27,440 --> 02:07:28,719
if you're to have a case management

2845
02:07:28,719 --> 02:07:31,040
system or think that it also means that

2846
02:07:31,040 --> 02:07:32,560
you have to spend more time

2847
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:36,000
um taking those notes while while

2848
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,599
while you're you're doing an

2849
02:07:37,599 --> 02:07:39,679
investigation because you don't know if

2850
02:07:39,679 --> 02:07:41,520
that's the investigation when you start

2851
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:44,320
it it's going to require a report so it

2852
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:46,960
we view it as a way of of helping with

2853
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:48,719
just improving that ability of taking

2854
02:07:48,719 --> 02:07:49,599
notes during

2855
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:54,320
during a investigation itself

2856
02:07:54,320 --> 02:07:55,920
yeah and this provides the

2857
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:58,880
accountability and the responsibility

2858
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:00,639
to the organization and makes the

2859
02:08:00,639 --> 02:08:09,840
analyst the hero

2860
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:13,040
so once we've we've established these

2861
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:14,639
these diff these new type of

2862
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:18,000
of templates that to follow and

2863
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:21,440
um all the the um

2864
02:08:21,440 --> 02:08:23,199
extra work that's going to be it it does

2865
02:08:23,199 --> 02:08:24,880
it is a lot of extra work right so we're

2866
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:26,480
not getting rid of any of the work it's

2867
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:27,040
not

2868
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:29,679
it's not um it's not taking away from it

2869
02:08:29,679 --> 02:08:31,199
what it is doing is it's

2870
02:08:31,199 --> 02:08:33,679
it's creating that knowledge a written

2871
02:08:33,679 --> 02:08:36,000
written knowledge history of of

2872
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,760
what happened within your organization

2873
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:40,159
so back to what raja was saying earlier

2874
02:08:40,159 --> 02:08:42,560
with with when we have onboarding right

2875
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:44,079
you're now in a technically stronger

2876
02:08:44,079 --> 02:08:46,639
place because when you onboard new new

2877
02:08:46,639 --> 02:08:47,920
people to the team

2878
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:49,440
you can give them a history of the

2879
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:51,679
organization um you know for

2880
02:08:51,679 --> 02:08:54,480
for within cyber security um i recall

2881
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:55,760
it's somebody saying

2882
02:08:55,760 --> 02:08:58,159
in another presentation that

2883
02:08:58,159 --> 02:08:59,360
traditionally everything

2884
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:02,960
is has been closed door and

2885
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:04,560
by having more reports and getting it

2886
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:06,239
into more people's hands it's

2887
02:09:06,239 --> 02:09:08,400
trying to open up the doors there so

2888
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:10,400
it's not just you pass something to a

2889
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:10,960
team

2890
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:13,599
uh the work gets done and then and then

2891
02:09:13,599 --> 02:09:15,040
uh

2892
02:09:15,040 --> 02:09:17,280
you don't hear about later on it's it's

2893
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:18,800
to give it's to help

2894
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:20,800
rise up people from that are new to the

2895
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:22,639
to the area but also help

2896
02:09:22,639 --> 02:09:25,199
help bridge that communication between

2897
02:09:25,199 --> 02:09:27,040
your your business or with your

2898
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:27,760
customers

2899
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:29,760
or within your or even internally within

2900
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:31,280
your organization

2901
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:33,679
so having more of that this reporting

2902
02:09:33,679 --> 02:09:35,280
you return back to being technically

2903
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:36,159
stronger

2904
02:09:36,159 --> 02:09:39,440
um with all the information yeah and

2905
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:41,199
this also takes you back to the

2906
02:09:41,199 --> 02:09:42,960
the slide that we talked about desiring

2907
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:44,639
for something new right

2908
02:09:44,639 --> 02:09:46,560
you could take these reports and you can

2909
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:47,679
go and cross

2910
02:09:47,679 --> 02:09:50,800
train between teams or as you're

2911
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:52,320
shadowing different teams and

2912
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:56,000
learning new skills these reports

2913
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,320
come in handy on the cases that you

2914
02:09:58,320 --> 02:09:59,440
worked on

2915
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:03,040
and how it was written you get to add

2916
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:06,480
new things or remove it or adapt to

2917
02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:07,840
something new

2918
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:09,840
right and then you can use these same

2919
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:12,320
reports that you are the heroes for

2920
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:15,520
to mentor junior analysts which helps

2921
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:16,800
the whole organization

2922
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:21,040
as you're growing together as one team

2923
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:22,880
it also allows you to start doing more

2924
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:24,400
burn downs with

2925
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:27,679
with those uh impacted portions within

2926
02:10:27,679 --> 02:10:29,360
your business or within

2927
02:10:29,360 --> 02:10:31,920
your customer base um by taking that

2928
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:32,880
information

2929
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:35,599
and and you can read it to them and now

2930
02:10:35,599 --> 02:10:37,360
you're also a point of contact

2931
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:40,400
so that's this has been our our main

2932
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:41,679
goal there is to get

2933
02:10:41,679 --> 02:10:44,159
more involvement by not just having it

2934
02:10:44,159 --> 02:10:44,960
where

2935
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:47,119
um when something happens if people go

2936
02:10:47,119 --> 02:10:48,320
straight to the leadership they can go

2937
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:49,920
straight to the people that are involved

2938
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:50,239
with

2939
02:10:50,239 --> 02:10:56,239
the the work itself

2940
02:10:56,239 --> 02:10:58,719
with that you know we have like three

2941
02:10:58,719 --> 02:11:00,320
templates right so we can

2942
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:02,960
take the the one pager at the executive

2943
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:03,760
summary

2944
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:05,520
the event summary and detail report the

2945
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:07,440
detail report is as your

2946
02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:09,679
formal report that has every single

2947
02:11:09,679 --> 02:11:10,480
nitty-gritty

2948
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:13,280
detail in it so the executive summary

2949
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:14,480
and the event summaries the

2950
02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:16,639
executive summary is that quick summary

2951
02:11:16,639 --> 02:11:18,880
that you would provide to

2952
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:21,119
your leadership team exactly like what

2953
02:11:21,119 --> 02:11:22,320
happened that five

2954
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:24,480
like same as what james said if you're

2955
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:26,400
getting into an elevator with the leader

2956
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:28,400
for like say five or six floors what are

2957
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:29,280
you going to explain

2958
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:31,920
that same concept will apply to the

2959
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:33,280
executive summary

2960
02:11:33,280 --> 02:11:36,880
piece like just a quick overview

2961
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:39,760
mitigation and what are the quick next

2962
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:40,800
steps

2963
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:43,440
the event summary template in this case

2964
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:44,079
is

2965
02:11:44,079 --> 02:11:46,719
more internally within your teams or

2966
02:11:46,719 --> 02:11:48,159
your sister teams

2967
02:11:48,159 --> 02:11:50,639
you know when did it start who's the

2968
02:11:50,639 --> 02:11:51,679
internet handler

2969
02:11:51,679 --> 02:11:54,079
that worked on it what's the location

2970
02:11:54,079 --> 02:11:55,760
your contact information

2971
02:11:55,760 --> 02:11:59,119
any any pertinent detail on the host id

2972
02:11:59,119 --> 02:12:00,400
the ip address and

2973
02:12:00,400 --> 02:12:02,800
your summary of finding so what work

2974
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:04,000
that was done

2975
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,239
as the next analyst comes in and picks

2976
02:12:06,239 --> 02:12:08,000
this up to do additional work they'll

2977
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:08,400
have

2978
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:10,560
everything that they need to move

2979
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:11,599
forward

2980
02:12:11,599 --> 02:12:14,079
and you have the final the detailed

2981
02:12:14,079 --> 02:12:16,079
report that will have the full

2982
02:12:16,079 --> 02:12:18,719
summary the risks and the search term

2983
02:12:18,719 --> 02:12:19,440
that you use

2984
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:21,840
screenshots your technical findings

2985
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:22,880
timeline

2986
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:24,960
and any of the gaps and improvements

2987
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:26,400
that will help

2988
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:29,920
with the next incident

2989
02:12:30,719 --> 02:12:34,560
so you you may ask um

2990
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:36,560
how does this all apply a story circle

2991
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:37,679
so what we want to

2992
02:12:37,679 --> 02:12:40,719
want to be able to do is have

2993
02:12:40,719 --> 02:12:42,800
this this framework here where as an

2994
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:44,239
analyst is going through something

2995
02:12:44,239 --> 02:12:46,159
and they they start the this reporting

2996
02:12:46,159 --> 02:12:48,239
process they can lay out what it is they

2997
02:12:48,239 --> 02:12:49,599
want to cover in that report

2998
02:12:49,599 --> 02:12:51,599
so they can do a quick little fill in

2999
02:12:51,599 --> 02:12:53,199
the blanks here for this this out

3000
02:12:53,199 --> 02:12:54,480
for this framework and then they can

3001
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:56,560
write about it so you can cover the key

3002
02:12:56,560 --> 02:12:57,920
points that you want to have

3003
02:12:57,920 --> 02:12:59,280
establish that narrative that you want

3004
02:12:59,280 --> 02:13:01,199
to have behind your report so it

3005
02:13:01,199 --> 02:13:02,079
actually tells a complete

3006
02:13:02,079 --> 02:13:04,079
story because we all know that some some

3007
02:13:04,079 --> 02:13:05,199
investigations

3008
02:13:05,199 --> 02:13:07,520
go off in multiple directions so you

3009
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:08,880
want to make sure you can reel that back

3010
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:09,360
in

3011
02:13:09,360 --> 02:13:11,440
and get those points across within the

3012
02:13:11,440 --> 02:13:12,639
the summary report

3013
02:13:12,639 --> 02:13:15,040
from from the work you've done the other

3014
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:16,800
thing that it allows them to do is when

3015
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:18,079
you when i say you

3016
02:13:18,079 --> 02:13:20,239
the you doesn't have to be you yourself

3017
02:13:20,239 --> 02:13:22,239
as the analyst it can also be

3018
02:13:22,239 --> 02:13:23,920
the component you're investigating so if

3019
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:25,760
you're looking at like let's say

3020
02:13:25,760 --> 02:13:28,880
uh back to the malware example you can

3021
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:29,280
use

3022
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:32,400
you can use the malware piece itself as

3023
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:35,440
as the as the you you can take like you

3024
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:37,280
can take that piece of malware

3025
02:13:37,280 --> 02:13:39,679
turn it into the the you into the whole

3026
02:13:39,679 --> 02:13:40,800
story about that

3027
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:44,000
that um you as how the malware

3028
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:47,199
um what it did how it acted

3029
02:13:47,199 --> 02:13:49,360
um where it was going and all those type

3030
02:13:49,360 --> 02:13:50,960
of all those components of the actual

3031
02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:52,239
activity itself

3032
02:13:52,239 --> 02:13:53,520
so it allows you to establish that

3033
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:56,079
narrative um within there

3034
02:13:56,079 --> 02:14:00,159
so so it gives a little more freedom to
