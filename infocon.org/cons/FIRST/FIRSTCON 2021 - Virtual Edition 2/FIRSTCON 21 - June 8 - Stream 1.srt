51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,560
first conferences have been pretty close

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,479
to our heart i've been attending first

53
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,000
conferences on and off

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,680
for almost 13 14 years now

55
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,280
and today we are excited to present on

56
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,120
scoring security vulnerabilities in

57
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,800
medical devices

58
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,000
talking about a rubric um that was

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,560
announced by the the u.s food and drug

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,760
administration

61
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,720
end of last year specifically talking

62
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,280
about

63
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,879
new scoring methodologies for

64
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,560
vulnerabilities in health care and

65
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,200
medical devices

66
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,319
and before we get started real quick

67
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,200
um i'm the founder and ceo of deep armor

68
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,599
uh

69
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,840
previously worked for intel palm and sun

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
microsystems

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,760
um in a variety of security roles um i

72
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,640
also have with me

73
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
rahul who is a security analyst with

74
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,400
special focus on cloud and web

75
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,239
application security

76
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,519
the palmer is a a small boutique

77
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,360
security consulting firm based out of

78
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,959
bangalore india

79
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,040
we work on vulnerability assessments

80
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,280
stlc pen testing secure design

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,640
consultations and so on

82
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,080
all right so let's dive right in

83
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,159
the agenda for today we have roughly

84
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,080
about 26 minutes

85
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,680
so we're going to be talking a lot about

86
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,519
healthcare and medical device security

87
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,400
that's the fundamental topic we do a

88
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,000
quick intro to cvss

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,280
quick because this is first and cvss

90
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,560
uh well the first is the home of cvss

91
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,280
so we'll talk about what cbss is talk

92
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,360
about some of the challenges with cvss

93
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,480
and then what the fda

94
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,599
has done uh specifically for healthcare

95
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,200
and medical devices

96
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,840
to enable more accurate and precise and

97
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,280
justifiable scoring

98
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,760
for vulnerabilities we talk about

99
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,879
customizations

100
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,000
what goes into the rubric and we also

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,560
talk about

102
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,959
how to use an online calculator uh to

103
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,400
the best of our knowledge this is the

104
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,000
only online calculator available

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,959
at this point for this rubric for

106
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,640
medical devices

107
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,080
and of course we don't want to just make

108
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,280
it all theory

109
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,519
we have at least one case study

110
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,120
depending on the time

111
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,879
maybe too but it's quite likely that

112
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,880
it's going to be one case study where we

113
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,918
compare

114
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,000
scoring the security vulnerability with

115
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,720
the rubric and with the cvss and how

116
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,479
things can change

117
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,240
and finally we wrap it up talking about

118
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,000
the next steps some of the gaps

119
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,680
and future work for this product

120
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,400
healthcare and medical devices uh have

121
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,360
gone digital

122
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,600
a lot more in the in the recent past

123
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,320
especially in the last 10 to 15 years

124
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,800
and what has come as part of this

125
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,440
movement

126
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,040
is that there have been new kinds of

127
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,800
attacks new kinds of vulnerabilities and

128
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,000
exploits

129
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,840
affecting these medical devices so if

130
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,440
you just look at the last two to three

131
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,160
years

132
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,400
there have been many headlines similar

133
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,160
to what you see on the screen

134
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,840
most recently less than a year ago there

135
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,759
were um vulnerabilities discovered and

136
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,400
reported

137
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,639
energy healthcare ideological devices

138
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,680
there have been issues

139
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,160
in mechatronic products and there have

140
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,840
been some very interesting

141
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,840
presentations at security conferences as

142
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
well uh most notably on

143
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,240
insolent pumps on pacemaker hacks and so

144
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,520
on

145
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,520
so this is a problem that we can't

146
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,880
afford to ignore anymore

147
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,120
um it's it's no longer theoretical it's

148
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,520
no longer just on paper

149
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,280
but some of these attacks can have very

150
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,720
severe impact

151
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,680
which means it's imperative that we have

152
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,520
the right kind of platforms we have the

153
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,199
right kind of tools

154
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,440
for doing not only the security

155
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,360
assessments and secure design

156
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,479
and evaluation but also communicating

157
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,039
effectively about vulnerabilities in

158
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,000
medical devices

159
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,479
and when we talk about communicating

160
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,919
about vulnerabilities

161
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,320
cbss kind of is the gold standard right

162
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,120
now

163
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,520
it's pretty much universal at this point

164
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,280
almost every security analyst

165
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,720
is aware of what cbss is the special

166
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,319
interest group for cvss

167
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,160
is under the first umbrella and um

168
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,479
broadly speaking i expect most of the

169
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,919
audience to know what cbs

170
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,759
is otherwise please refer to the first

171
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,360
url that we have shown on the screen

172
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,240
here essentially cvss has

173
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,319
three parts to it one is called the base

174
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,680
score which is

175
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,520
the simpler calculator that you see on

176
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,039
the screen at the bottom

177
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,400
you also have the temporal and

178
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,280
environmental score that allows you to

179
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,199
tweak the knobs a little more to get a

180
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,800
more accurate score depending on your

181
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,759
environment

182
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,520
depending on the exploit availability

183
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,120
depending on the fixed availability and

184
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,880
so on

185
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,360
the reason why i have marked the base

186
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,919
code

187
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,680
in green is that it's the most prevalent

188
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,080
it's the most used it's the easiest

189
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,199
so that tends to be the option opted by

190
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,880
most security teams

191
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,199
currently 3.1 is the latest version i

192
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,720
know there are many extensions and

193
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,479
frameworks and work going on

194
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,599
for the future revisions of cbss quite

195
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,000
simply

196
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,360
put cvss gives you a score from 0 to 10

197
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,240
and being critical show stopper uh

198
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,479
blocker whatever you call it

199
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,960
zero being no risk not a vulnerability

200
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,160
or something that is not

201
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,360
exploitable or doesn't warrant

202
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,960
you know the security response

203
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,120
there are certain challenges with cvss

204
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,440
in fact one of my former employers

205
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,680
preferred not to use cvss because it

206
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,680
could lead to

207
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,680
interpretation of scores in such a way

208
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,520
that it does not reflect the actual

209
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,199
vulnerability or the risk in the right

210
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,000
way

211
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,400
but having said that cbss as i said is

212
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,639
really universal but

213
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,800
with that universality comes certain

214
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,400
problems right so it's designed

215
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,280
to be one size fits all in a way you see

216
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,440
product manufacturers in the iot space

217
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,960
and the web application space

218
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,840
linux kernel network protocols pretty

219
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,440
much every sector where there is

220
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,879
digitalization digital

221
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,919
digitization new cvss

222
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,840
for scoring vulnerabilities not only in

223
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,680
software but also in hardware and

224
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,360
firmware and pretty much

225
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,199
all through the stack and the other

226
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,840
uh the the other uh kind of an obstacle

227
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,879
with with cvss

228
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,319
is subjectivity because the definitions

229
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,720
can be interpreted differently uh the

230
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,440
answers

231
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,479
can be very subjective i may answer a

232
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,879
certain question let's say about

233
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,599
scope which is often debated or let's

234
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,000
say

235
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,080
uh the attack complexity what may be

236
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,279
simple to me could be

237
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,360
interpreted as really complicated for

238
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,039
someone else

239
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,679
so this can lead to different scoring

240
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,959
and also the number of

241
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,680
knobs may be limited um if you see the

242
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,360
if you remember the screenshot

243
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,160
there were there were eight of them um

244
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,519
three of them for confidentiality

245
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,000
integrity

246
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,360
availability and a bunch of them for

247
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,440
attacker profile and within each of

248
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,959
those there's either a none

249
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,040
low or a high for most of them so the

250
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,480
number of options for each is still

251
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,720
limited

252
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,279
and temporal and environmental sections

253
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,640
often lead to more work

254
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,279
often lead to more subjectivity and and

255
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,399
essentially

256
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,120
um they just fall through the cracks

257
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
most secure teams security teams tend to

258
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,800
use the base core

259
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,680
and this can lead to a lot of confusion

260
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,480
and ambiguity

261
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,040
in terms of is it really representing

262
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,560
the the impact

263
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,240
of the vulnerability correctly is it

264
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,839
representing the risk associated with

265
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,560
vulnerability currently

266
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,120
all risks are not secure are not equal

267
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,600
um

268
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,360
so this kind of subjectivity in one size

269
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,519
fits all can be really problematic

270
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,839
uh you score a vulnerability for you for

271
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,600
your facebook app or

272
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,200
for instagram or a social media

273
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,720
application but then you're using the

274
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,600
same yardstick let's say for a pacemaker

275
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,240
so um there are concerns about whether

276
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,800
this kind of scoring this kind of

277
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,959
rating of vulnerability is getting the

278
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,240
right kind of attention

279
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,279
in the medical community

280
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,560
the medical community scoring or poor

281
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,000
communication of information

282
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,720
or lack of justification can have a

283
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,000
severe impact

284
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,079
because we are talking about um

285
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,360
prioritization

286
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,600
and how the uh the engineering teams

287
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,279
need to respond how the

288
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,040
executives need to respond how the

289
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,720
incident response team has to respond

290
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,760
and so on

291
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,640
so any kind of ambiguity can have a

292
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,320
pretty severe impact

293
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,240
and also it becomes imperative that

294
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,920
there are new parameters

295
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,760
and new definitions that are

296
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,320
mandatory in a way or that that it would

297
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,160
make a lot of sense to accommodate them

298
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,440
for example clinical environment

299
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,279
conditions patient safety and so on

300
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,000
for this purpose um in order to address

301
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
some of these challenges and ambiguities

302
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,360
the u.s fda worked with mitre over over

303
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,040
the last couple of years

304
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,279
and as of october 2020 they announced

305
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,360
the rubric for cvss

306
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,680
so the rubric is essentially a

307
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,279
healthcare medical device

308
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,160
specific scorecard and a template that's

309
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,519
lathered on top of the cvss 3.0 spec

310
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,720
there have been multiple internal

311
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,640
revisions and sponsor studies so a lot

312
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,480
of work has gone into this

313
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,200
and as an outcome we have the cyber

314
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,000
security

315
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
medical device development tool the

316
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,200
purpose of this

317
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,160
is to generate accurate severity scores

318
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,959
we talked about

319
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,519
how there could be ambiguities and

320
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,560
shortcomings

321
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,920
so that's exactly what they want to

322
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,560
address the purpose is to score

323
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,000
uh accurately and justify this course

324
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,640
so uh as part of this there are certain

325
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,560
healthcare specific metrics

326
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,839
that have been clearly defined in the

327
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,959
specifications and this also includes

328
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,320
patient safety

329
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,000
medical device design and clinical

330
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,880
network environment

331
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,959
again if you want to summarize the

332
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,279
purpose of the mddp it is to generate

333
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,399
accurate severity scores

334
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,000
so how does it work um the fda and my

335
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,320
effort does not reinvent the wheel so we

336
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,079
now have structured questions for

337
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,959
serious and base core metrics

338
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,360
but the c i and a the confidentiality

339
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,000
integrity

340
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,079
availability metrics have gone through a

341
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,040
lot of

342
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,440
rehauling and overhauling there have

343
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,959
been six new sections

344
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,720
specifically on healthcare related

345
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
topics with respect to data as well as

346
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,399
functionality

347
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,000
some of the scoring is not interactive

348
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,720
unlike the the traditional cvss

349
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,279
based on how you answer question a

350
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,000
question b

351
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,720
may come up or question c may pop up so

352
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,240
new options appear based on how you

353
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,279
answer

354
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,600
and there are 31 new extended metrics

355
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,720
each of these start with an

356
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,079
x that can seem a lot but actually

357
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,440
they've made it simpler

358
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,760
through these decision flow diagrams and

359
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,639
extended vector diagrams

360
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,519
and what they are if you look at one

361
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,680
section for example privileges required

362
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,079
there are two three new extended metrics

363
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,160
here um so you look at

364
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,360
the text in bold it's xbrl xbrz

365
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,560
and xbrs and there are certain questions

366
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,240
that you answer these questions are more

367
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,360
focused

368
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,440
as compared to what the core cvs aspect

369
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,279
says so these are more specific

370
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,360
to health care and medical devices and

371
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,519
as you answer yes no or unknown

372
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,760
you get new options and then you land at

373
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,279
the privileges required

374
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,880
outcome for that particular case

375
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,800
similarly there is an extended vector

376
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,480
table this is another representation for

377
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,440
the rubric

378
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,639
where the questions are more verbose and

379
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,320
it also provides you the values

380
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,920
and the element that are relevant

381
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,440
extended vector elements that are

382
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,399
relevant

383
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,240
so you use this as the reference and

384
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,079
then you answer these questions

385
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,680
and that helps you generate the score

386
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,720
before we start with the case studies i

387
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,240
want to talk about patient safety

388
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,560
uh because this has been customized for

389
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,639
healthcare and medical devices

390
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,800
any adverse effect on patient safety is

391
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,680
flat so

392
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,040
this there is a there's a flag where

393
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,920
it's called pips or short for potential

394
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,600
impact to patient safety

395
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,880
the idea is that um if a certain marker

396
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,399
has come up for pips

397
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,399
then you may be required to do an

398
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,720
internal safety oriented hazard analysis

399
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,560
and report this to the fda for

400
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,720
as part of your post-market post-market

401
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,000
guidance

402
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,199
this is one of the activities that's

403
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,040
commonly associated with class two class

404
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,560
three medical devices

405
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,600
so this ties in nicely where

406
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,120
as part of the scoring mechanism you're

407
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,839
also providing that information to the

408
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
fda

409
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,040
the fda also recommends that you perform

410
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,320
these activities

411
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
by consultation with a group of smes

412
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,480
including security professionals device

413
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,160
engineering professionals

414
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,720
health care experts as well as i.t

415
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,360
integration

416
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,760
office you know interoperability experts

417
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,560
so this

418
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,880
reduces the likelihood of um

419
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,880
subjectivity it gets more inputs from a

420
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,639
broad range of experts in the space

421
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,360
all right uh i'm gonna head over to

422
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,880
rahul here to talk about

423
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,360
the online calculator for the rubric and

424
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,079
also show you how to use it

425
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:11,279
over here on uh let me just stop sharing

426
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,320
all right thank you samantha

427
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:27,839
just wanted to share my screen

428
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,839
we can see your screen

429
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,880
okay hello everyone this is rahul from

430
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,600
deep armor

431
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,680
so from here i will walk you through the

432
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,519
d parma's online calculator

433
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,040
which is also called as rubric

434
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,959
calculator and as you can see these are

435
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,360
the links where you can

436
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,519
find the calculator so do visit this

437
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,440
links and check out the calculator

438
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,120
by yourself so before i show you the uh

439
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,160
calc rubrics calculator i will show you

440
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,240
the cvss calculator which you all are

441
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,360
familiar with

442
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,680
and then i'll show the rubric calculator

443
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,000
to compare the differences

444
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,839
so as you can see there are eight

445
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,839
different metrics under the space core

446
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:04,640
sections

447
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,880
where each metrics have been defined or

448
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,039
to select a particular option

449
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,119
in order to evaluate a particular

450
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,720
security threat

451
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,919
so but these options sometimes limit the

452
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:16,720
options

453
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,799
for perfectly defining a particular

454
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,640
vulnerability to be specific the

455
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,400
vulnerabilities which are affecting the

456
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,799
uh

457
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,359
medical devices so in order to evaluate

458
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,240
those kinds of

459
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,840
vulnerability we should be using rubrics

460
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,120
calculator

461
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,520
so this is how the rubrics calculator is

462
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,280
used and this is the web page where you

463
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,200
can see the rubrics calculator

464
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,679
so the rubric calculator mainly

465
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,840
concentrates on scoring medical devices

466
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,039
uh vulnerability

467
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,600
uh and as you can see under each uh

468
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,640
metrics

469
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,880
which offers you a structured questions

470
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,640
where we need to answer all these

471
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,400
structured questions in order to

472
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,480
evaluate a particular vulnerability

473
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,360
in a better way sometimes what happens

474
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:03,679
is

475
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,559
uh the user or the analyst will not be

476
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,000
sure about the

477
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,240
answers to certain questions so at that

478
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,480
times this rubric calculator

479
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,799
will take the worst case scenario and it

480
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,400
is going to calculate the worst case

481
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,080
vector value

482
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,760
and the interesting part is whenever we

483
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,440
answer a particular question

484
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,760
so the rubrics calculator is going to

485
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,360
skip some of the questions which are not

486
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,960
relevant to the uh

487
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,200
vulnerability so for example for this

488
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,600
field if i select the option as yes

489
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
as you can see these two questions have

490
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,440
been skipped by the calculator

491
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,799
because these two questions are not

492
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,919
relevant for the previous questions

493
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,240
so once you answer all these questions

494
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,400
uh where we get the attack vector value

495
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,520
uh in this place

496
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,080
so in the next part uh the uh matrix

497
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,360
which comes under

498
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,720
this mis uh basic metric group uh

499
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,840
which are i mean with these metrics are

500
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,919
all similar to what we have previously

501
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,120
seen in the uh

502
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,160
rubrics i mean uh in cvs's calculator so

503
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,520
as you can see we can

504
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,799
uh this is the attack complexity

505
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,880
matrix and the privilege required uh

506
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,640
metrics also has some of the structured

507
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,000
questions here

508
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,559
and the user interaction and scope

509
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,240
metrics are also same

510
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,600
as the cvss calculator

511
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,960
so coming to the next part uh the rubric

512
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,880
calculator mainly concentrates on the

513
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,919
confidentiality

514
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,799
integrity and availability factors uh by

515
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,080
mainly considering some of the

516
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,919
healthcare aspects

517
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,320
uh as soon as explained previously this

518
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,440
year impact

519
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
will be divided into six different

520
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,919
sections where each section

521
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,679
specifies a particular health care

522
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,960
aspect

523
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,679
so like once we uh answer all these

524
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,480
specific

525
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,679
questions under each section so we are

526
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,840
going to get a rubric cbs score

527
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,640
over here so this was about the

528
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,720
walkthrough of the uh

529
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,039
rubric calculator so we'll get back to

530
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,159
the slides

531
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,840
for the further

532
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,640
so now we will see some of the case

533
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,480
studies where we'll understand some of

534
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:24,799
the

535
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,799
vulnerabilities which are affecting the

536
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,919
medical device

537
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,720
and then we'll calculate uh the cbs

538
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,200
score

539
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,679
for the particular vulnerability using

540
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,240
both

541
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,120
cvss and the rubric calculator

542
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,440
so in this vulnerability uh

543
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,440
so in this case study the vulnerability

544
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,120
was discovered

545
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,000
on a market product which is classified

546
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,559
as to be as the classroom medical device

547
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,840
where this medical device can be

548
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,240
connected to a mobile application via

549
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,880
bluetooth

550
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,120
so the vulnerability here is whenever

551
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,400
the medical device is

552
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,360
unpaired it is always discovered by the

553
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:03,760
other

554
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,640
bluetooth devices so what happens now is

555
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,039
uh

556
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,799
it will open a door for an attacker

557
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,200
where he can use his malware application

558
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,799
in order to connect to that particular

559
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,200
medical device which will prevent the

560
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,080
actual user

561
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,720
uh to connect uh to the medical device

562
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,320
and the attacker might cause

563
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,720
some denial of service condition for the

564
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,960
user

565
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,200
so as we know the vulnerability now so

566
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,039
we'll calculate the cvs score

567
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,360
for this particular vulnerability

568
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,480
so for the attack vector matrix i am

569
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
going to select the option as

570
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,760
adjacent because the medical device

571
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,840
which we are using in this case uh it is

572
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,480
it uses

573
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,440
a uh ble protocol for the communication

574
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,000
part

575
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,840
where uh in order to explore this

576
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,440
particular vulnerability it should be on

577
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,960
the same protocol level

578
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,200
that means it cannot be exploited or

579
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,880
remotely so i'm going to select the

580
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,480
option as adjacent

581
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,159
and for the attack complexity i'm going

582
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,400
to select as high because

583
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,240
the user i mean the attacker should

584
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,559
perform some of the previous tasks

585
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,320
like you need to create a malware

586
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,200
application

587
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,840
uh so and some of the other tasks he

588
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,600
should perform so the attack complexity

589
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,520
will be high here

590
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,880
and there is i mean uh the attacker

591
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,840
doesn't require

592
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,080
require any privilege accounts are in

593
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,840
order to exploit this vulnerability so

594
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,080
i'm going to select kind for this option

595
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,480
and also uh the attacker doesn't require

596
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,400
the user interaction in order to exploit

597
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,840
the vulnerabilities so i'm going to

598
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,559
select for this option as well

599
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,000
so for the scope field i'm going to

600
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,480
select the option as unchained because

601
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,799
the exploited vulnerability doesn't

602
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,480
affect any resources

603
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,520
beyond the security scope so

604
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,840
that will be unchanged and there is no

605
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,600
loss in the confidential data

606
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,720
so again this field also goes none

607
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,760
and again uh there is on i mean there is

608
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,720
no effect in the

609
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,559
data that the device is going to be

610
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,320
stored that the medical device is going

611
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,600
to be stored so i'll

612
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,000
select the option as none for this for

613
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,760
the availability of

614
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,440
field i'm going to select the option as

615
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,960
low because

616
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,360
once the exploit is done uh the

617
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,520
availability of the data which the

618
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,159
device is stored it will be partial so

619
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,600
i'm going to select the option as low

620
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,480
for this

621
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,200
for this case so as you can see we got

622
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,240
the uh

623
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,679
cvss score as 3.1 so we'll do the same

624
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,240
for this vulnerability using

625
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,120
rubric's calculator as well just a

626
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,439
moment

627
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,480
okay

628
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,240
so for this attack vector metrics the

629
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,520
first question is

630
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,159
is asking that can the attacker utilize

631
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,840
some type of network or communication

632
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,159
protocol to exploit this polarity

633
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,279
uh since uh this uh medical device is

634
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:01,840
using

635
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,080
ble protocol for the communication part

636
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,360
uh we are going to select

637
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,240
yes for this option

638
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,120
and the next question is it's asking us

639
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,480
does it use

640
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,080
any osi specific protocols like ipr

641
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,600
like tcp or udp so since only ble

642
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,120
protocols have been used uh

643
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,279
we are select we are selecting the

644
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,320
option as no here

645
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,120
so the next question is uh like since

646
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,840
the uh

647
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,480
communication part with the medical

648
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
device is taking place via bluetooth

649
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,840
which is a wireless channel

650
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,679
so i'm going to select the option as yes

651
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,360
here

652
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,520
so in in order to explore this

653
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,600
particular vulnerability

654
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,279
the attacker should be in the range

655
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,960
approximately 10 feet

656
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,600
or less around the medical device so i'm

657
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,879
going to select the option as

658
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,120
yes for this so we have answered all the

659
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,600
questions

660
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,760
for this particular matrix and we got

661
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,799
the

662
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,320
vector values local for now

663
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,039
so for the next matrix that which comes

664
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,960
under a basic metric group which are all

665
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,520
similar

666
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,679
to as what we have seen what we have

667
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,440
defined in the vulnerability previously

668
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,000
using

669
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,120
cvss calculator

670
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,200
so i'll select those default values for

671
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,320
this calculator as well

672
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,679
so the privilege required will be no

673
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,640
and the user interception also is no and

674
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,919
this is same as the

675
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,039
cvs calculator

676
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,760
so coming for the for the next part uh

677
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,760
since the medical device doesn't store

678
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,080
any data that is related to phi

679
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,720
or pi data and also the device the

680
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,559
medical device which we are using in

681
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,279
this case

682
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,200
doesn't store any data related to

683
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,480
diagnosis

684
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,720
also it doesn't store any data related

685
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,840
to

686
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,200
the delivery of therapy and and also uh

687
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,880
the device which we are using in this

688
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,919
case doesn't store

689
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,760
any data related to the clinical

690
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,320
workflow so i'm going to select

691
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,840
the all the options as none for this

692
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,440
case

693
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,360
so we'll do the same for this section as

694
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,840
well

695
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,639
and for this

696
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,039
so we have selected the options now uh

697
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,320
in the next section this

698
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,480
uh section mainly concentrate on the

699
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,240
functionality part of the medical device

700
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,360
where

701
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,320
the attacker will block the

702
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,400
functionality of that particular medical

703
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,880
device

704
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,880
so based on this scenario we'll answer

705
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,039
these particular questions

706
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,360
so the functionality part cannot be read

707
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,360
or exposed in this case so we'll select

708
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,480
none for this option

709
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,960
again the functionality of the device

710
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,559
cannot be deleted

711
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,919
so we'll select none for this option

712
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,679
since the attacker is going to block the

713
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,240
functionality part of the medical device

714
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,000
so we are going to select the option as

715
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,520
low for this case okay

716
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,919
uh in the next section as well the

717
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,360
medical device which we are using in

718
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,039
this case doesn't store any

719
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,159
sensitive data so all the

720
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,000
questions under this section will select

721
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,039
the option as none

722
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,480
so we have answered all the questions

723
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,039
so you as you can see here we got the

724
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,039
rubik's cube score s4

725
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,679
and the severity level is medium so

726
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,039
let's get back to the

727
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:49,840
slides and we'll compare the results now

728
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,279
so this is the screenshot for the cbs

729
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,159
calculator

730
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,399
where we have selected every option

731
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,000
under each matrix

732
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
and as you can see we got the cvss score

733
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,200
as 3.1

734
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,240
for this case and this is the tabular

735
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,640
form

736
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,919
for all the questions that we have

737
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,919
answered using rubric calculator

738
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,679
and this is a better way to analyze the

739
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,039
answers that the user has

740
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,120
opted as you can see in the below

741
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,480
screenshot

742
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,559
this is the comparison part for the cvs

743
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,000
score uh

744
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,960
where this score is this is the score

745
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,679
using

746
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,559
we got the score using cbs's calculator

747
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,720
and this is the score we got uh

748
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,440
using rubric calculator so as you can

749
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,520
see the severity level here

750
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,039
uh deviates from low to medium and also

751
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,159
we can see some

752
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,840
uh major deviations in the cvss core

753
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,880
part as well

754
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,840
which is from 3.1 to 4.0

755
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,600
thanks rahul so i think in the interest

756
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,880
of time we'll just jump to the

757
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,919
conclusion

758
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,159
um if you can just hand over the screen

759
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,640
back to

760
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,600
okay okay

761
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,760
right

762
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,760
cool thanks so we saw one case study

763
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,320
where

764
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,279
the cvs's core actually changed so we

765
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,159
were

766
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,760
the using the cvss um the actual

767
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,480
uh 3.1 calculator we saw that the score

768
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,279
was uh

769
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,080
a low but using the rubric for cvss by

770
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,760
answering some of those questions

771
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,679
specifically we saw that it jumped to a

772
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,200
medium

773
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,919
and note that the attack vector and the

774
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:42,320
um

775
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,360
the access vector in the attack

776
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
complexity has changed

777
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,679
this is because uh the attacker profile

778
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,279
has not really changed but by reading

779
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,080
the rubric

780
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,919
and analyzing those questions that the

781
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,080
rubric specifically calls out

782
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,720
for some of these sections um it was

783
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,760
easier for us

784
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,799
to actually lower the

785
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,080
access complexity from high to low

786
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,880
and the access vector from a local to

787
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,640
from an adjacent to the local

788
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,559
right so uh what helped in this case was

789
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,640
that um there are very explicit

790
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,480
questions in the rubric

791
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,880
that enabled us to answer these

792
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,200
questions specifically and precisely

793
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,440
and hence arrive at a score that is more

794
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,399
justifiable

795
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,080
compared to the the regular cbss 3.1

796
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,520
calculator similarly in the interest of

797
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,799
time we'll just breeze through this

798
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,919
there is another

799
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,919
case study where the score did not

800
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,600
change much at all

801
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,279
it just came down from 7.9 to a 7.8

802
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,399
so what we're trying to say is that

803
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,559
don't expect this to dramatically change

804
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,080
the results but there could be certain

805
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,440
specific cases

806
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,120
where the rubric can actually provide

807
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,799
you with a more accurate

808
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,640
framework for scoring medical devices

809
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,360
vulnerabilities

810
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,799
and lastly while this is showing a lot

811
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,519
of promise

812
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,080
there are certain gaps and more work to

813
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,600
be done

814
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,960
some of these studies have been done on

815
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,360
very focused groups of medical devices

816
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,279
so it may not apply to all kinds of

817
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,880
medical devices

818
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,080
and this this guidance is not suitable

819
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,399
for

820
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,080
pre-market submissions this is not for

821
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,600
evaluating risks

822
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,440
and vulnerabilities in the architecture

823
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,279
and design this is more for device level

824
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,720
vulnerabilities

825
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,320
and essentially the the feedback and

826
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,000
data is still relatively thin this is

827
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,840
this is brand new in a way

828
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,279
because these kind of programs take

829
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,880
years to mature and

830
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,240
eventually reach that kind of uh

831
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,919
stability so i think uh to summarize

832
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,840
this is really promising this can help

833
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,519
the healthcare and medical environment

834
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,519
uh to a large degree

835
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,120
and um and yeah so so that's what we had

836
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,240
for today

837
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,440
so if you have any questions we're going

838
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,200
to be hanging out in the work adventure

839
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,600
2d

840
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,640
platform um and if any anyone wants to

841
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,279
talk to us

842
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,600
about uh medical device security and

843
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,600
healthcare iot security chat anytime

844
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,000
cool thank you very much to mans and and

845
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,159
rahul pretty interesting work

846
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,600
um yes as suman said um q a

847
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,919
is in record work adventure so be sure

848
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,360
to hang out there

849
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,840
and with that i think we're going to

850
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,640
transition

851
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,360
to the next talk

852
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,840
bye

853
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,240
tracy do we start right now yeah go

854
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:40,559
right

855
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,399
go right ahead okay cool um

856
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,080
so hey mitsuhara son um my name is alex

857
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,159
i'm the moderator of this session

858
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,000
um we will be

859
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,919
having a q a right after this

860
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,760
presentation in work adventure

861
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,039
um so make sure to go over there um

862
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,440
it's our conference to the virtual

863
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,960
social platform

864
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,039
um and this is also the place where you

865
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,840
find the experience and other fun

866
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,399
activities

867
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,480
with that it's it's a great pleasure to

868
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,000
introduce mitsuhara-san

869
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,440
uh who works as a researcher for nct ntt

870
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:17,840
is a

871
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,519
is a long time contributed to first

872
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,120
stuff today he will share

873
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,000
a model to automatically evaluate risk

874
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,880
by combining cvss things with like s

875
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,399
assets sensitivity so i'm really looking

876
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,600
forward to this talk

877
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,360
and now heading over to you stages yours

878
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,840
okay

879
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,760
uh could you see it yes everything looks

880
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,840
good

881
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,519
okay

882
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,918
uh thank you for your introduction

883
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,359
uh as shown here

884
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,560
the title of my presentation is simple

885
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,440
method of

886
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,839
automatic risk assessment for web

887
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:22,879
systems

888
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,800
considering asset sensitivity

889
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,879
to begin with let me tell you something

890
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:29,918
about myself

891
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,719
my name is mitsuhara sasaki and i'm a

892
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,440
member of

893
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,199
entity thought which is a seasoned

894
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,719
organization of

895
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,440
mtt a japanese telecommunications

896
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,760
company

897
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,800
up to now i have been engaged in

898
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,719
vulnerability assessment and management

899
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,440
for seven years and in my present

900
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,679
research

901
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,320
my goal is to achieve security

902
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,359
operations

903
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:03,839
that anyone can easily perform

904
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,359
okay uh let me give begin by giving you

905
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,320
an overview

906
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,240
of our research our objective of our

907
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,119
objective

908
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,599
is to automate the work of risks

909
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,640
assessment

910
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,720
that up to now has been done manually

911
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,160
this work has required advanced skills

912
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,520
and has been costly to perform

913
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,480
to meet this objective we propose a

914
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,760
simple risk assessment

915
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,680
considering the asset sensitivity of

916
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,880
web systems this method

917
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,680
automatically calculates the asset

918
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,599
sensitivity of our web system

919
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,119
from access roads and web content

920
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,000
and output our risk score without

921
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,200
requiring advanced skills

922
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,680
it calculates asset sensitivity from the

923
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,119
viewpoint of

924
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,839
confidentiality integrity and

925
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,520
availability

926
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,320
and combines this asset sensitivity with

927
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,520
cbss

928
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,880
to output the risk score we

929
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,280
perform risk assessment considering

930
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,800
asset sensitivity

931
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,359
and examine the effectiveness of the

932
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,880
proposal method

933
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,839
by an experiment using web systems

934
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,040
operated in

935
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,240
an actual company

936
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,800
my presentation is organized as shown

937
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,079
here

938
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,200
background proposal method

939
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,599
evaluation experiment result and

940
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:40,640
discussion

941
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,598
and conclusion

942
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,000
ok let me give you some background

943
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,359
according to the national vulnerability

944
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,640
database

945
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,800
the number of vulnerability is

946
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,839
increasing

947
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,880
year by year uh total

948
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,680
of 80 356 vulnerabilities

949
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,359
were reported in 2020

950
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,320
in particular anyone can access web

951
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,119
systems

952
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,280
that are open to the public on the

953
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,320
internet so there are many opportunities

954
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,920
for attacks appropriate countermeasures

955
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,280
to vulnerabilities must be taken

956
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,720
however this huge number of publicly

957
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,240
released vulnerabilities

958
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,720
makes it difficult to deal with all of

959
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,800
them

960
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,839
for this reason my many

961
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,079
corporate security analysts and

962
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,200
administrators

963
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,160
need to quickly assess risks to

964
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,480
prioritize vulnerability countermeasures

965
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,359
in general risk can be determined from

966
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,520
three elements asset variability

967
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,800
and threat this is

968
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,359
a risk can be determined by accessing

969
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,079
each target

970
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,960
system from the viewpoint of what kind

971
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,920
of system has

972
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,200
what kind of vulnerability and what kind

973
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,920
of threat

974
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,200
exists however

975
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,440
assessing the risk of each system is

976
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,480
difficult

977
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,839
for these three reasons

978
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,280
first there are many systems managed by

979
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,640
security analysts

980
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,160
and administrators so risk assessment

981
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,920
takes time second

982
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,720
while a variety of guidelines for risk

983
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,599
assessment

984
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,200
are presented by a nist iso and other

985
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,560
organizations

986
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,760
they tend to be very versatile but

987
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,440
highly abstract at the same time

988
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,320
this means that analysts themselves must

989
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,800
decide on detailed procedures

990
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,520
and they must possess advanced skills

991
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,079
such as

992
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,040
knowledge of business operations and

993
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,480
knowledge of risks assessment

994
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,119
third today's shortage of security

995
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,240
expert is

996
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,599
making it extremely difficult to educate

997
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:12,880
and seek a partner

998
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,320
having such specialized skills

999
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,000
as a result risk assessment is not

1000
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,800
an easy task due to a variety of cost

1001
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,839
factors

1002
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,640
including operational cost and cost of

1003
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,000
acquiring skilled partner

1004
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,680
practically speaking we can assess risks

1005
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,920
and prioritize vulnerability

1006
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,200
countermeasures

1007
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,440
by using a vulnerability assessment

1008
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,320
method

1009
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,200
called the common variability scoring

1010
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,920
system

1011
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,280
or c basis this is

1012
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,640
a framework for assessing

1013
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,119
vulnerabilities it expresses the

1014
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,760
stability of a particular vulnerability

1015
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,839
by a 10-level cbss score

1016
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:03,119
we can assess risks easily by using c

1017
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:03,760
basis

1018
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,960
squads however

1019
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,319
in general published cbs space scores

1020
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,599
do not consider assets

1021
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,960
there are value that focus only on

1022
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,720
variability and threat

1023
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,000
which means that the they cannot

1024
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,119
provide an appropriate assessment of the

1025
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,040
target system there is a concern that

1026
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,040
countermeasures to higher risk

1027
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,640
vulnerabilities will be

1028
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,480
put off until later and that more money

1029
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,680
than necessary

1030
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,119
will be spent on security

1031
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,440
countermeasures

1032
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,920
therefore there is a need to establish

1033
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,720
an automatic risk assessment method

1034
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,440
considering asset sensitivity

1035
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,960
up to now a variety

1036
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,280
of risks assessment methods have been

1037
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,400
proposed

1038
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,800
but most of previous research has

1039
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,640
focused on vulnerabilities and threats

1040
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,880
a few risks assessment methods that

1041
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,040
consider said sensitivity

1042
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,400
have been proposed for example

1043
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,680
acceptor they propose a

1044
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,040
method that defines a set sensitivity at

1045
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,079
the

1046
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,920
sum of the cbss scores of the

1047
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,280
variabilities possessed by the system

1048
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,319
however this is a method focused

1049
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,440
on vulnerabilities it does not

1050
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,400
sufficiently

1051
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,079
consider set uh in addition

1052
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,240
circuit buzzer data proposed a method

1053
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,720
for determining asset sensitivity

1054
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,760
using system information like

1055
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,359
server function however

1056
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,760
in this method analyst must manually

1057
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,560
correct

1058
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,599
and classify asset information which

1059
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,440
requires advanced skills

1060
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,560
in response to these problems we propose

1061
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,720
a risk assessment method

1062
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,359
that automatically considers asset

1063
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,079
sensitivity

1064
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,440
in a web system here

1065
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,319
is a conceptual diagram of the proposed

1066
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:17,760
method

1067
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,079
this method consists of three processes

1068
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,319
the first process is data correction

1069
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,720
this process obtains web content from

1070
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,520
the target web system

1071
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,920
the second process is calculation of

1072
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,920
asset sensitivity

1073
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,839
this process calculates asset

1074
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,000
sensitivity by analyzing the

1075
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,560
web content and previously prepare

1076
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,280
prepared

1077
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,040
access logs the third process

1078
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,160
is output of risk score

1079
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,680
this process output risk score by

1080
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,119
evaluating the given cbs score based on

1081
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,920
sea basis environmental metrics using

1082
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,319
asset sensitivity

1083
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,319
the proposed method ascent website that

1084
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,440
have web content

1085
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,800
as target systems it also considers

1086
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,800
administrators and security analysts

1087
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,000
that must manage

1088
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,640
many websites in addition

1089
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,440
the asset sensitivity values and risk

1090
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,520
squads charactered by the purpose method

1091
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,400
are not

1092
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,839
absolute values they are expressed as a

1093
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,520
related ranking

1094
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,839
among the web systems in the

1095
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,920
organization

1096
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,079
in the following slide i will describe

1097
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,720
in detail age process of proposal method

1098
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,560
in data collection process input is

1099
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,560
the fqdn of a target system

1100
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,880
this then is used to correct the web

1101
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,599
content

1102
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,480
of the target system using a web crawler

1103
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,640
the correction process begins by

1104
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,760
searching for

1105
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,280
any rings within the top page

1106
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,880
it makes transition to each page pointed

1107
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,440
to by

1108
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,480
link and get the content

1109
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,640
of that page then it searches for

1110
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,520
links again within each of those pages

1111
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,720
this process is repeated up to a

1112
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,079
specified hierarchy to correct web

1113
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,119
to web content

1114
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,079
next i will describe the calculation of

1115
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,720
asset sensitivity

1116
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,599
in the proposed method we focused on the

1117
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:44,800
viewpoint of

1118
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,440
confidentiality integrity and

1119
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,599
availability

1120
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,800
the first index is sensitivity of

1121
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,160
confidentiality

1122
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,319
denoted by alpha we consider that

1123
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,160
the more confidential information a

1124
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,359
system has

1125
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,400
the greater the impact the second

1126
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,119
index is sensitivity of integrity

1127
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,079
denoted by

1128
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,520
beta the more web content and

1129
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,480
function are system hearts the greater

1130
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,400
the impact

1131
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,359
finally the third index is sensitivity

1132
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:20,560
of availability

1133
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,319
denoted by gamma the greater the number

1134
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,160
of system users

1135
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,839
the greater the impact the three terms

1136
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:30,880
are for

1137
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,480
beta and gamma corresponding to

1138
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,720
these three elements are now summed up

1139
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,079
to give asset

1140
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,319
sensitivity s in the following slides

1141
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,960
i will describe in detail each of three

1142
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,839
elements

1143
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,920
first is sensitivity of confidentiality

1144
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,839
alpha this sensitivity is calculated

1145
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,720
based on

1146
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,359
whether a login form exists and the

1147
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,760
number of accesses

1148
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,560
we chose the existence of a login form

1149
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,280
as a basis for this calculation

1150
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,599
because our system having confidential

1151
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:10,400
information

1152
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,520
should restrict access by authentication

1153
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,200
functions

1154
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,839
in addition we chose number of accesses

1155
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,200
as another basis

1156
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,399
for this calculation

1157
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,400
since the volume of confidence

1158
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,079
information tends to

1159
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,720
increase proportionally to the number of

1160
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,000
users

1161
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,400
which means that the impact of an

1162
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,640
incident is likely to be great

1163
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,400
for a large number of users

1164
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,400
here a of w sub i

1165
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,720
denotes the number of accesses to the

1166
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,680
target system

1167
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,960
w sub i and

1168
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,760
l of w sub i denotes whether our login

1169
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,720
form

1170
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,760
exists in the content of the target

1171
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,440
system

1172
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,839
the number of accesses is determined by

1173
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,599
counting the number of unique ib

1174
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:02,640
addresses from

1175
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,839
access rows the process calculates

1176
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:09,040
the product a and

1177
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,800
l for each system and uses the maximum

1178
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,400
value

1179
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,599
of these products as a logarithmic base

1180
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,559
then it calculates the logarithm of the

1181
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:21,760
target system

1182
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,839
to determine the value alpha

1183
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,240
next is sensitivity of integrity beta

1184
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,720
this sensitivity is calculated by

1185
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,040
determining the total number of contact

1186
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,960
items content items

1187
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,240
and parameters in each pages

1188
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,960
this is based on the idea that since

1189
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,280
tampering occurs by the misuse of

1190
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,839
functions on the system the greater the

1191
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,319
number of content items and functions

1192
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,160
that can be tampered with

1193
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,559
the greatest impact when an incident

1194
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,640
occurs

1195
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,640
uh here b of w sub i denotes the number

1196
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,640
of

1197
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,400
content items in target system w sub i

1198
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,240
it is calculated from the number of

1199
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,040
pages in the obtained content

1200
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,559
in addition c of w sub i

1201
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,040
denotes the number of parameters in

1202
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,200
target system w sub i

1203
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,280
it is calculated by counting the

1204
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,520
parameters used by the system

1205
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,160
from imp tanks and form tags within a

1206
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,000
page

1207
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,960
similar to confidentiality calculations

1208
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,240
the

1209
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,280
process calculates b of w

1210
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,880
sub i and c of w sub y

1211
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,960
for each target system and uses the

1212
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,720
maximum value of

1213
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,559
b of w sub y and of c of w sub i

1214
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,760
other logarithmic bases it calculates

1215
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,559
the regression

1216
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,000
of v of double sub i

1217
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
end of c of w sub i and sum the two

1218
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,880
logarithms

1219
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,839
to determine the value beta

1220
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,040
finally we calculate sensitivity of

1221
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:07,920
availability

1222
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,359
gamma this sensitivity is calculated

1223
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:11,839
from

1224
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:15,440
number of accesses this is based on the

1225
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,400
idea that

1226
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,400
the greater the number of users the

1227
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,800
greatest impact when a system outage

1228
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,720
occurs

1229
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,640
uh here the number of access is

1230
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,760
calculated from

1231
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,839
access loans obtained from the target

1232
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:30,079
system

1233
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:33,200
as as in the previous calculations uh

1234
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,200
the maximum value of

1235
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,319
a of w subway calculated for each target

1236
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:39,680
system

1237
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,720
is used as a logarithmic base

1238
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,079
and the logarithm of a of w sub i

1239
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,319
for the target system is calculated to

1240
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,599
give the value

1241
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:52,000
gamma

1242
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,720
next i'll describe the process for

1243
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,599
outputting a risk score

1244
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,079
this process calculates risk using the

1245
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:06,640
environmental metrics of cbss

1246
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,920
these environment environmental metrics

1247
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,760
are defined by cbss this about metrics

1248
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,599
for assessing the

1249
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,640
vulnerability risk including the asset

1250
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,400
of the target system risk is expressed

1251
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,800
expressed by the this formula

1252
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,119
here impact is a time related to

1253
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,079
asset and exploitability is a time

1254
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,200
related to the

1255
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,640
vulnerability and threat

1256
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,319
the impacts term includes variables

1257
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:45,680
called security requirements which based

1258
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,839
on the conditions of the target

1259
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:51,200
system when the vulnerability is

1260
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,160
published

1261
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,800
the barriers of terms other than these

1262
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,200
security requirements

1263
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,240
are simultaneously published so

1264
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,440
consequently

1265
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,319
in the proposed method we only replace

1266
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,800
the

1267
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,680
barriers of these security requirements

1268
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,160
with

1269
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,359
asset sensitivity values and evaluate

1270
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:14,160
the cbs score to determine the risk

1271
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,160
score

1272
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,440
the term cr ir

1273
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,040
and air respectively related to

1274
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,440
confidentiality integrity and

1275
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,119
availability

1276
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,440
each it's expressed by the time

1277
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,640
corresponding to

1278
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:34,640
its asset sensitivity plus k

1279
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,640
here k is a constant equal to 0.5

1280
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,880
which is used to match each of those

1281
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,880
terms with the services score range

1282
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,520
i will now describe the evaluation

1283
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,839
experiment

1284
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,559
for this evaluation we used web systems

1285
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:55,680
operated by an

1286
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,400
actual company and performed an

1287
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,200
evaluation

1288
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,440
using rank correlation coefficient

1289
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,200
between system importance

1290
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,880
and asset sensitivity here

1291
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,760
system importance expresses a level

1292
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,599
decided beforehand

1293
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,240
by a security analyst in the company

1294
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,280
based on

1295
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,800
internal company policies a system

1296
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,280
deemed

1297
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,559
important by the company is set to high

1298
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,640
and a system not deemed important is set

1299
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,118
to raw

1300
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,880
the types of systems used in this

1301
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,559
experiment

1302
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,440
include the company's official website

1303
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,359
customer service site

1304
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,319
tech wrong product introduction site and

1305
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,240
so on

1306
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,880
this experiment aberrates whether a

1307
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,160
correlation exists

1308
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,800
between previously assigned system

1309
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,839
importance

1310
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,880
and asset sensitivity obtained by the

1311
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,520
proposed method

1312
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,559
in the experiment we evaluated

1313
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,079
a total of 18 systems corrected

1314
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,520
access loans for a period of one month

1315
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,559
starting from drive first 2020

1316
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,760
and corrected data by starting through

1317
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,240
three

1318
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,919
hierarchical layers

1319
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,559
to begin with here the result of

1320
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,440
calculating

1321
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,839
acid sensitivity for each of the 18

1322
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:28,480
systems

1323
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,640
for this category based on

1324
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,119
system importance it has not been

1325
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:35,839
possible

1326
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,240
to evaluate difference in asset

1327
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,440
sensitivities

1328
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,319
between systems within the same category

1329
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:43,040
that is

1330
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,240
high or low however

1331
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,400
it can be seen here that the

1332
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,480
quantitative barriers provided by the

1333
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,680
proposal method

1334
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:58,879
make it possible to rank each system

1335
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,599
these slides show the result of

1336
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:04,400
calculating

1337
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,319
asset sensitivity in detail

1338
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:11,760
first sensitivity of confidentiality

1339
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,040
alpha tended to have high scores

1340
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,680
for main website that handle customer

1341
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,599
information such as customer service

1342
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,920
site

1343
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,760
next sensitivity of integrity beta

1344
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,880
intended to have high scores for us

1345
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,119
websites such as the company's official

1346
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,680
website

1347
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,720
and finally sensitivity of availability

1348
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,160
gamma tended to have high scores for

1349
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:42,880
website

1350
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,720
with a large number of users

1351
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,440
next this right so the

1352
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,720
run correlation coefficient and

1353
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,480
the distribution of asset sensitivity

1354
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,640
using spearman's lung correlation

1355
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,680
coefficient

1356
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,760
we determine the correlation coefficient

1357
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:04,960
between system

1358
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,440
importance and asset sensitivity

1359
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,680
we obtained a positive correlation of

1360
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:15,760
0.82 for asset sensitivity

1361
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,960
s which suggests that the proposed

1362
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,319
method is a varied

1363
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:24,240
indicator of system importance

1364
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,440
also a positive correlation was obtained

1365
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,559
for the elements alpha beta

1366
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,559
and gamma the right figure

1367
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,520
shows a normalized histogram of asset

1368
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,880
sensitivity

1369
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,000
these results show that systems of

1370
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,119
high importance can be separated from

1371
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,400
systems of low importance according to

1372
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,319
asset sensitivity which indicates that

1373
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:55,520
company policies can be expressed by

1374
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,799
of asset sensitivity

1375
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,839
finally as a case study we present an

1376
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,040
example of outputting

1377
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,799
the risk score using actual

1378
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,359
vulnerabilities

1379
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:14,400
uh here we present

1380
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,200
only a portion of these results

1381
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,640
concerning space limitations

1382
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,799
we calculate risk scores using two

1383
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,559
vulnerabilities related to

1384
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:27,599
web servers the first vulnerability

1385
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:28,400
relates

1386
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,680
to the apache http server

1387
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,599
it affects confidentiality and integrity

1388
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:39,119
cvss base score is 6.1

1389
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,760
the second vulnerability relates to the

1390
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,119
microsoft ios server it affects only

1391
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:48,480
availability cbs space score is

1392
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,359
7.5

1393
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,559
we calculate risk score considering the

1394
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:57,200
asset sensitivity of the target system

1395
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,079
using computation formula for cbss

1396
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:03,280
environmental metrics

1397
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,960
on examining these results we can see

1398
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,319
that system 3

1399
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:11,040
having the highest asset sensitivity

1400
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,960
obtained the highest risk score for

1401
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,079
these vulnerabilities

1402
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,640
furthermore on comparing system 5 and

1403
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,680
system 6

1404
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:24,079
with respect to the cb 2019

1405
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:27,280
941 system 5

1406
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,960
has higher

1407
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,720
about the risk score the system 6

1408
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:39,680
is a higher get higher risk score

1409
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,760
this suggests the feasibility of risk

1410
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,200
assessment concerning the asset

1411
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,400
sensitivity

1412
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,599
of 80 score also

1413
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,720
because the com

1414
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,079
so because the gamma of system six is

1415
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:54,880
higher than

1416
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,520
a system five and so this

1417
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,960
vulnerabilities are fixed only

1418
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,640
availability

1419
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,319
so this result reflects correct

1420
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,480
evaluation

1421
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,160
so in the past it is difficult to

1422
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,400
prioritize variability count measures

1423
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,319
based on c basis

1424
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:12,400
based squads without considering asset

1425
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,000
sensitivity however

1426
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,880
using the proposed method to evaluate

1427
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,520
these scores would make it possible

1428
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,359
for example if the budget for

1429
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:23,040
vulnerability counter measures is

1430
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:23,760
limited

1431
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,520
count measures for system 3 should be

1432
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,480
given priority

1433
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:31,280
based on this result we can say that the

1434
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,480
proposal method

1435
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,839
worked as hypothesized for the most part

1436
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:37,359
and that is proved to be

1437
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:40,240
an effective technique however we found

1438
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:40,720
that

1439
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,599
some issues remained first it is

1440
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:44,960
difficult to

1441
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,440
calculate asset sensitivity in the

1442
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,599
system that has no login pages

1443
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,760
but that corrects and manages customer

1444
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,079
information through a contact page

1445
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,720
second it is difficult to crawl through

1446
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,160
pages that make a

1447
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,480
transition by inputting appropriate

1448
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,280
parameters

1449
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,799
through web forms or apis which makes

1450
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:07,119
it difficult to calculate accurate

1451
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:07,920
squats

1452
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,160
we need to make further improvement to

1453
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:13,440
deal with these issues

1454
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:16,640
i will now conclude my presentation we

1455
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,000
propose a simple method

1456
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,400
of risks assessment considering asset

1457
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,680
sensitivity

1458
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,920
this method defines asset sensitivity

1459
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,599
and automatically

1460
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,400
output the risk score using access logs

1461
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,240
and web content

1462
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,280
in this way it is a method that can

1463
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,680
assess risk without requiring advanced

1464
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,040
skills

1465
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,599
we confirm the effectiveness of the

1466
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:40,640
proposal method

1467
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,440
by conducting an evaluation experiment

1468
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,200
using web systems of

1469
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,240
an actual company

1470
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,559
that completes my presentation thank you

1471
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:51,599
very much for

1472
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:54,400
your attention

1473
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:00,160
thank you very much um q a will now

1474
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:04,079
happen in the um virtual world

1475
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,359
so make sure to check it out um

1476
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:09,280
and i think now we have a little break

1477
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,240
before we continue

1478
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,680
yeah great thanks guys yeah we're gonna

1479
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,880
go into a break

1480
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:20,000
um streams two and streams three are

1481
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,119
on break as well they will resume uh

1482
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,280
this after well actually wherever you

1483
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,119
are they will resume

1484
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:31,040
at 14 30 but we will have a featured

1485
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,559

practitioners in the wild excuse me

1488
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:42,000
we'll start in this stream at 13 15. all

1489
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,680
right we will go into break thanks

1490
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,078

1580
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,840
how do people get into security and

1581
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,600
those of us who've been in it how do we

1582
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,760
stay in it so long

1583
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,040
i think a lot of us have been

1584
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,040
firefighting for a while and

1585
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,679
the twists and turns can certainly be um

1586
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:09,120
challenging sometime

1587
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,280
so today we have a great panel to talk

1588
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,719

1593
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,480
from many different angles

1594
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,480
we have folks representing all kinds of

1595
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:27,520
different

1596
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,480
businesses and vendors and backgrounds

1597
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,600
and i don't want to take up too much

1598
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,960
time because i just kind of want to jump

1599
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,159

um carolyn can we start with you please

1607
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:50,239

1608
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:50,640

1609
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,520
uh thank you so much sean and tracy and

1610
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,520
i'm just super excited to be here

1611
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:58,239
um how did i get started so when i was

1612
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,080
16 or 17 years old

1613
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,640
my father who is a chinese immigrant

1614
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:03,600
asked me

1615
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,360
what would you like to study in college

1616
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,040
and i said i would like to study dance

1617
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,800
because i love dance or i would like to

1618
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,080
study psychology

1619
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,920
because i think that's very interesting

1620
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,280
and he's a chinese immigrant to the

1621
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,719
united states so he said

1622
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:16,400
you're going to study engineering and

1623
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,400
you're going to attend the best school

1624
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,840
you get accepted to

1625
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,760
and so what happened was i studied

1626
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,360
electrical engineering and computer

1627
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,960
science at uc berkeley

1628
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:28,000
when i was a junior in college i i

1629
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,520
thought oh now it's time to look for a

1630
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,040
summer internship

1631
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:34,560
i applied to 50 or so companies

1632
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,640
around where my boyfriend at the time's

1633
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,480
family was based because i wanted to

1634
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,080
stay with his family instead of

1635
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,400
my family that summer uh and i ended up

1636
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,320
getting an internship at ebay

1637
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:48,080
i graduated from school and i said oh

1638
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,920
you know i have enjoyed this so much i

1639
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,920
would really like to work here full-time

1640
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,480
and they said well uh it has a hiring

1641
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,239
freeze so we don't have a position for

1642
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:56,800
you

1643
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,880
but there's an entry-level position uh

1644
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,560
in information security there's actually

1645
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,440
a couple

1646
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,600
and at the time this was 2005 i said i

1647
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,040
don't know what information security

1648
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:05,520
means

1649
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,440
and they said that's okay you know the

1650
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,440
they were looking for a new college grad

1651
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:12,719
uh and the rest the the the last 16

1652
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:13,679
years are

1653
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:17,360
are now history though that you made it

1654
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,640
sound so easy

1655
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:22,480
[Laughter]

1656
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,080
how about you what was your where did

1657
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,440
you come from where was your background

1658
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,320
from you know

1659
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,159
i think it's kind of going to be similar

1660
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:29,360
so i um i

1661
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,120
can't i grew up in central asia for

1662
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,800
those who don't know um that's where i

1663
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:33,760
went to college

1664
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,159
um so when i was graduating high school

1665
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:37,679
i want to do something with math

1666
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:40,400
because i love math and so basically i

1667
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,239
had two choices economics or computer

1668
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:42,880
science

1669
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,760
um and i was like hmm let's let's go

1670
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,520
computer science

1671
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,000
and that's how i ended up being so i

1672
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,679
finished my bachelor's computer science

1673
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:53,199
and then after that i had a

1674
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:55,760
great opportunity to do my master's in

1675
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,719
india

1676
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:58,320
and so i spent three years in india

1677
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:01,280
doing my master's

1678
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,960
i didn't take any security related

1679
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,719
courses i mean they didn't offer any

1680
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:08,480
in my undergrad my grad nothing

1681
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,719
and i have to finish i finished my

1682
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:12,960
master's i had opportunity to intern

1683
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,320
with wolbang

1684
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,040
and that groom the group that i was

1685
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,880
interning ended up being in security and

1686
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,280
enterprise security and that's how i

1687
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,640
ended up in security so it was

1688
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,440
purely you know it wasn't intentional it

1689
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,199
just happened to be my first internship

1690
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:28,480
in security

1691
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,719
and that's how i started um uh

1692
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:31,520
insecurity

1693
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:35,520
and just like how in the rest is history

1694
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,040
wonderful wonderful katie

1695
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,520
how did you get started well first of

1696
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,159
all again

1697
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:43,920
thank you so much for having me on this

1698
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,199

01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:47,199
you and and the fellow panelists are

1700
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,480
among my favorite people in this

1701
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,679
industry so it's

1702
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:51,679
it was a pleasure to get up this early

1703
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:53,040
let me just say that

1704
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,159
um so how did i get started

1705
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:59,120
in security well before there was an

1706
01:19:59,120 --> 01:19:59,760
industry

1707
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:02,159
i was hacking things so in the late 80s

1708
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:03,920
when i was a teenager

1709
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,960
i was on a local bulletin board system

1710
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:11,199
in you know near boston where i grew up

1711
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:14,159
and um it was some of the same members

1712
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:16,400
of the loft hacking group where

1713
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,880
were on that that same bbs as well as

1714
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:19,440
the

1715
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,199
cult of the dead cow and some of the

1716
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:22,880
earliest hacking groups so

1717
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,639
i grew up hacking and there wasn't

1718
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:26,400
really a career in it back then

1719
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,199
so um when i went to college i studied

1720
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:32,320
molecular biology and mathematics and

1721
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,000
then i decided that i didn't want to

1722
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,920
work in molecular biology and

1723
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:36,800
mathematics

1724
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,520
and but i was still good at computers so

1725
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,159
um

1726
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:42,239
so you know i made a few transitionary

1727
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:44,000
hops i'm first doing systems

1728
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:44,960
administration

1729
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,360
at the genome center at mit where i was

1730
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,880
working and then

1731
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,880
moved into systems administration again

1732
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,159
at the department of aeronautics and

1733
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:53,760
astronautics at mit

1734
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,600
and we were getting attacked left and

1735
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,600
right so there was my opportunity to

1736
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,760
dust off the old hacking skills

1737
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,760
but instead hack myself before someone

1738
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,199
else could um

1739
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:04,639
and then i became a professional

1740
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:06,880
penetration tester just at the very

1741
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,320
beginning of when that industry was

1742
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,920
starting again with some of my old

1743
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,440
childhood friends

1744
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,840
former loft members who had started a

1745
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,920
consultancy called at stake

1746
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,800
and um i think it was at stake was

1747
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,320
acquired by symantec

1748
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,360
and symantec sent me off

1749
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:26,080
along with a a lot of other ad stakers

1750
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,560
to ebay where i actually met caroline

1751
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:28,880
and

1752
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,920
and members of her team um in the early

1753
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,280
you know early days of

1754
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,000
ebay security i remember finding some

1755
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,840
very weird vulnerabilities which i hope

1756
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:38,800
still don't exist

1757
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,400
but you know they're not paying me

1758
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,480
anymore to check so it's fine

1759
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,199
um but you know long winding journey and

1760
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:47,440
i would say you know that anybody in

1761
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,120
our industry who's been around for a

1762
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,719
while has probably had

1763
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:53,040
an unusual path or a non-traditional

1764
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:53,760
path so

1765
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,520
i want to encourage people out there to

1766
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,199
definitely you know

1767
01:21:57,199 --> 01:21:58,880
take leaps of faith especially in

1768
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,239
yourself

1769
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:02,719
i think that's a great point katie it's

1770
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:04,880
everyone i've met no one has had the

1771
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,120
typical i studied computer science for

1772
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,880
four years 20 years ago because

1773
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,760
you're right it didn't exist jeffrey how

1774
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:12,960
did you get involved

1775
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,800
how did you come here well thank first

1776
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,239
thanks for having me on this panel it's

1777
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:17,199
an honor

1778
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:20,159
to be here with my colleagues uh well i

1779
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:22,159
actually haven't told this story

1780
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:24,880
very very often my first entry to

1781
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,960
computer security was in high school

1782
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,760
we had a multi-user pdp-11 i'm dating

1783
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,800
myself

1784
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,840
uh system and i modified

1785
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,280
i'm not gonna use the word hacked i

1786
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,679
modified a system program so that

1787
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:39,280
if you run it and enter a certain

1788
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,199
keystroke it allows you to change

1789
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:42,719
yourself to any user

1790
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:45,679
on the system and i got busted uh for

1791
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:47,600
for doing it that was my first very

1792
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,840
so i then from that point on redirected

1793
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,239
my efforts to more honorable uh

1794
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:55,120
the honorable side and my first job was

1795
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,040
in enterprise i.t at the university of

1796
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,000
pittsburgh

1797
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,239
and that gave me a fantastic background

1798
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:01,600
of how do you how do you

1799
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:04,639
build scalable secure services to serve

1800
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:05,120
50

1801
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:08,159
000 users and at the time

1802
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:10,400
um the physics department was starting

1803
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,159
to get broken into very

1804
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:14,960
frequently and we would they'd be broken

1805
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,480
into we'd have to go help them

1806
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,719
recover and i tried to get the

1807
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:20,159
leadership of the computer center to

1808
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:20,639
realize

1809
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:22,400
we got to create a response team we have

1810
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,920
to make this more formalized we have to

1811
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,199
help these departments and they really

1812
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:26,000
weren't

1813
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,199
interested and i was very fortunate

1814
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:30,480
based on location

1815
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,159
that the cert coordination center

1816
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:33,679
carnegie mellon was right across the

1817
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:34,719
street

1818
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:38,159
and they were hiring and i was hired as

1819
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:39,120
a

1820
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:42,560
entry-level incident response analyst

1821
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,440
uh at the surf coordination center and

1822
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,440
ended up staying with cert for 20

1823
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:50,080
for 20 years so that's that's how i got

1824
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:50,880
started

1825
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,960
wow well thank you for sharing i i love

1826
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,320
it when it's stories we haven't heard

1827
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,880
before that's

1828
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:01,280
good get in the dirt so lots of

1829
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:02,800
experience here on this panel

1830
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,719
folks who've been been doing this and

1831
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:06,400
coming at it from different angles so

1832
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,080
you know coming at it from comms coming

1833
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,719
out from penetration testing um

1834
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:12,080
i myself am a former veterinary

1835
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,560
technician um

1836
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,600
again it's it all comes down to getting

1837
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:18,880
the foot in the door

1838
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:21,440
what do you all consider as is what's

1839
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,040
something important as a security

1840
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,320
professional if you were

1841
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,080
kind of advising somebody who's getting

1842
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:27,679
in what would you

1843
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:29,679
how would you direct them jeffrey let's

1844
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:31,440
start with you please

1845
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,440
well i think it's it's really important

1846
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,960
not to only focus

1847
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,679
on the technical skills a lot of times

1848
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:39,120
in our industry people think the

1849
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,040
technical skills are the most important

1850
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,320
thing and they focus

1851
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:45,920
on on that but that's not necessarily

1852
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:46,480
the most

1853
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:47,920
important thing it certainly is

1854
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,000
important but it's one of many things

1855
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:50,800
you really

1856
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,920
need to ensure that that in your career

1857
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,840
and when you're preparing yourself for

1858
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:56,960
your career

1859
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:00,000
that uh you know that communication is

1860
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,520
extremely important your ability to

1861
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:02,159
present

1862
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:04,239
you know both the written and oral

1863
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:05,679
communication are very

1864
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:08,800
important collaboration skills

1865
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:12,000
uh investigation just basic

1866
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
investigation skills intellectual

1867
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,679
curiosity so there's a lot more than

1868
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:16,239
just

1869
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:18,320
the technical skills that people tend to

1870
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,080
focus on and think of the most

1871
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,840
but i was never the most technical

1872
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,600
person in in any

1873
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,840
security room that i've been in and

1874
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,280
that's not what has

1875
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,520
helped me be successful it's been

1876
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,800
bringing people together

1877
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,960
helping to collaborate help them reach

1878
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,719
decisions and reach understandings

1879
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:36,480
together and so it's important to

1880
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:39,120
focus in other areas not just technical

1881
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,239
excellent

1882
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:41,440
does anyone else have something they'd

1883
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,000
like to add

1884
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:48,320
i think that something that's happened

1885
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:49,920
to me

1886
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,080
one million times throughout my career

1887
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,320
is that i encounter something that i

1888
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,040
don't know

1889
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,600
or that i've never done before uh and i

1890
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:58,639
would say

1891
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:01,679
uh to to any of us in the industry or or

1892
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:03,520
starting out in the industry

1893
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,920
don't be afraid of that that is going to

1894
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:06,719
happen

1895
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:09,679
just just be curious and just have a

1896
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:10,880
learning mindset

1897
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,840
um so number one focus on learning the

1898
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,040
other thing is that

1899
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,080
uh i've had a variety of like really

1900
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,120
positive

1901
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:21,920
and really not so positive experiences

1902
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:23,199
throughout my career

1903
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:26,159
um and i want to actually quote an

1904
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:28,320
online yoga teacher i follow

1905
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:31,040
yoga with adrien she says find what

1906
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:31,520
feels

1907
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:35,600
good and i think that not everyone

1908
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,080
is good at everything and not every

1909
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,639
context is right for every person

1910
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:42,800
so if you find yourself in a situation

1911
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,400
where you're like oh this doesn't feel

1912
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,280
very good

1913
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,600
then maybe that's an opportunity to

1914
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,600
focus on what does feel good if you're

1915
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,880
interacting with someone and you're like

1916
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,120
wow this is a really positive

1917
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:56,239
enriching encouraging experience you

1918
01:26:56,239 --> 01:26:57,440
know i'm really connecting with this

1919
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,560
person like

1920
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,880
that's a person to spend more time with

1921
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,719
you know and if you encounter someone

1922
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:04,000
and they're putting you down or they're

1923
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,600
not treating you well that's a person to

1924
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,600
like try not to spend time with so

1925
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,760
i would say number one focus on learning

1926
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,280
number two

1927
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,760
like adrian from yoga with adrian says

1928
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:14,560
you know find

1929
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:17,679
find what feels good i love it katie did

1930
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:19,280
you it looked like you had something

1931
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,199
more to add you know i couldn't have

1932
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:23,199
said it better in terms of keeping that

1933
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:25,920
open and learning mindset um honestly

1934
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:26,880
the field is so

1935
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,920
new and so relatively green

1936
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,520
and as we're seeing from all these

1937
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,600
ransomware attacks definitely

1938
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,239
definitely not a solved problem you know

1939
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:37,440
in terms of getting

1940
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:40,000
uh getting everybody to the level of

1941
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,159
cyber security that that we need

1942
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:45,280
you know everyone to be at um so i think

1943
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:47,760
that preserving that you know open mind

1944
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,120
and curiosity

1945
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:51,760
and then understanding that you know

1946
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,159
taking your experiences from one place

1947
01:27:54,159 --> 01:27:56,480
there's always another place that needs

1948
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,960
to know what you have to offer right

1949
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,760
so manage your you know sort of manage

1950
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:02,800
your career path

1951
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:05,520
try and learn new things but also take

1952
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:07,520
those career opportunities

1953
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,000
where you might be able to you know be

1954
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,679
in charge of an organization

1955
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:13,679
at your next job where you know and

1956
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:15,280
apply the things that you learned

1957
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:16,960
not being in charge and being a team

1958
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,440
member you know at your previous job

1959
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,920
that's something that is also you know

1960
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:25,199
in terms of just general career advice

1961
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:27,679
we live in an era where it's normal to

1962
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:30,239
change jobs every couple of years or so

1963
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:31,920
and you know when i was kind of coming

1964
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,360
up career-wise that was certainly

1965
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,159
frowned upon

1966
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:36,480
you know i spent my first four years of

1967
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:37,520
my career

1968
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,520
working at one place because you know i

1969
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,760
thought you tried to get a job and stay

1970
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:43,520
there for life and kind of progress up

1971
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,320
the ladder

1972
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,080
but career-wise you know especially in

1973
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,239
cyber security don't let that

1974
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,239
that mindset limit you especially when

1975
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:52,000
there are new areas to learn

1976
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
and new organizations that might need to

1977
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,320
learn what you specifically have

1978
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,880
have a mast in terms of your knowledge

1979
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,239
that's great advice

1980
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:03,839
nazira do you have anything else to add

1981
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:07,280
i mean same thing i think um just to

1982
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:07,920
re-read

1983
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,560
about there are so many roles in

1984
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,560
security right so if you start somewhere

1985
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:13,840
and you don't like it

1986
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,280
try something else i mean there's so

1987
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,120
many things and you need to find

1988
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,880
something that's you're passionate about

1989
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:21,840
right so that makes you you know happy

1990
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:22,239
you

1991
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:24,159
you know look at the days like oh i'm

1992
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:25,760
gonna go all this solve all these

1993
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,679
problems right and i think security

1994
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:29,280
provides you that

1995
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,080
opportunities there's so many roles and

1996
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,760
don't feel discouraged if you go take

1997
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,920
your first secure job and you hate it

1998
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,000
um you know there must be something else

1999
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,920
for you yeah

2000
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:42,560
excellent excellent now as i mentioned

2001
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,800
earlier we have a lot of experience on

2002
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,320
this panel so

2003
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:47,840
let's kind of move on to the questions

2004
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,480
about how we have survived so long doing

2005
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,960
doing the kinds of jobs we do uh one of

2006
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,159
the questions i have is

2007
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:57,120
you know what would you do differently

2008
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,120
is there something you would change

2009
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:00,400
something that you would try and do

2010
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,080
better or something that you maybe would

2011
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:02,639
have

2012
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:05,760
let go of sooner in your career now that

2013
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:09,199
you're kind of looking back at it

2014
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:16,800
please um i guess looking back

2015
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,639
i mean there was a period of time in my

2016
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:20,239
career where

2017
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:22,080
you know even though people around told

2018
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,440
me like oh you need to go you know you

2019
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:24,960
should go to the leadership management

2020
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:25,440
track

2021
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:27,600
i resisted that for a while i was like

2022
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,880
no i like being technical i want to bic

2023
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:34,400
um so i think you know

2024
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:37,600
um obviously you need to do what feels

2025
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:38,480
right and

2026
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:41,199
um but i think it's for me was just it

2027
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:41,760
took

2028
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:44,080
probably longer to make that decision

2029
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:45,679
even though i don't regret that decision

2030
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:46,560
right i definitely

2031
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:50,400
love what i do um but i guess my advice

2032
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:51,679
is

2033
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:55,840
listen you know um and um

2034
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,159
so yeah for me i think that decision

2035
01:30:58,159 --> 01:30:59,840
took a little longer

2036
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:02,800
um you know maybe maybe it was for a

2037
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:03,440
reason

2038
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,920
i wanted to become really sure but um

2039
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:07,199
that that was

2040
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:08,639
one thing you know if i go back it's

2041
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:10,560
like maybe you know i should have

2042
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:13,280
talked to more mentors sooner get you

2043
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,520
know external um

2044
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:18,239
input sooner i think it just took me a

2045
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:19,520
little longer

2046
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:22,639
okay great carolyn

2047
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:25,120
so i've worked for super big companies

2048
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,960
and i've worked for super small

2049
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:30,320
companies and earlier in my career i had

2050
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,080
decided specifically

2051
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:34,560
to work for more established companies i

2052
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,239
i really believed that there was value

2053
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:37,360
to

2054
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:41,360
being more specialized in the context

2055
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:43,840
of an organization that already had a

2056
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:46,159
lot of relatively a lot of processes in

2057
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:47,040
place

2058
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:50,800
um i have loved working for a small

2059
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,840
company

2060
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,960
and and it's just because the

2061
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,000
impact of me as one individual and what

2062
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,239
i can accomplish at a small company is

2063
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:01,280
so different

2064
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,840
than what's possible at a larger company

2065
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:04,560
um and

2066
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:08,320
and therefore uh i also learn so much

2067
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:11,520
i get to know so much more about what my

2068
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:12,000
colleagues

2069
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,560
are doing and how what i do impacts what

2070
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:15,600
they do

2071
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,239
um and so that that would be something

2072
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:20,560
uh that i would maybe change i would i

2073
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:21,280
would maybe

2074
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:24,400
have begun to explore opportunities

2075
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,639
at at smaller companies much smaller

2076
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:27,440
companies

2077
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:29,280
uh earlier in my career because i've

2078
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,440
i've really just enjoyed that so much

2079
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:34,080
excellent excellent jeffrey how about

2080
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,199
you

2081
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:38,080
well i'm i'm very fortunate to think i

2082
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,440
don't regret

2083
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:41,840
any of the career choices that i've made

2084
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,360
i've i've been

2085
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:45,600
i've been blessed to work some for some

2086
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,360
really good organizations and i've

2087
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,239
learned a lot

2088
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:51,040
i think the area that i uh to this day i

2089
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,679
have to keep working is i'm an introvert

2090
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:55,199
and so it's hard for me to walk up and

2091
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:57,360
just start talking to people

2092
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:59,520
and you really really have to do that to

2093
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,840
build relationships with people

2094
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:04,560
uh you know especially people in first

2095
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,480
especially you build relationships with

2096
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:07,920
other people in other companies doing

2097
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,920
jobs because eventually someday

2098
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:11,440
you may be able to connect with them in

2099
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:12,719
some way that's going to help you in

2100
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:13,520
your

2101
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,600
career so i have to get out of my

2102
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:16,560
comfort zone

2103
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,000
and i know in this industry there's a

2104
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,840
lot of people that are also

2105
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,600
introverts and you have to force

2106
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:23,280
yourself to

2107
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:26,239
um to do what is uncomfortable because

2108
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:26,800
it will

2109
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,440
eventually pay benefits to you that's a

2110
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:30,560
very good point

2111
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:33,520
katie yeah you know that's a great point

2112
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,600
jeffrey about being an introvert so i'm

2113
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,280
an introvert who plays an extrovert on

2114
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,400
the internet you know

2115
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,600
um and um the fact that i think

2116
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:44,960
regret wise in my career um one i would

2117
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,639
have changed jobs more often you know we

2118
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:48,080
already talked about that a little bit

2119
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:48,639
but

2120
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:50,320
you know if you don't do that in your

2121
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:53,120
career sometimes you will find yourself

2122
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:55,920
um you will you will eventually find

2123
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,440
yourself working for people who have

2124
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:58,880
less experience than you

2125
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,719
and that's that's just the reality and

2126
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:02,320
maybe it's true in other

2127
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:03,920
other areas as well but i've been in

2128
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:05,600
cyber security for over 20 years and

2129
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,600
that's certainly been my experience

2130
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:09,440
um and then i would have started public

2131
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:10,639
speaking a lot sooner

2132
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:12,880
now granted at the time there were

2133
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,719
really not a lot of conferences that

2134
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:16,400
welcomed newcomers at all

2135
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,719
now you have a plethora of different

2136
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:20,639
conference opportunities you can do a

2137
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:22,719
b-sides they even have special

2138
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:25,040
um you know speaker coaches and mentors

2139
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,080
and things like that to help

2140
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:28,320
help you get going but i never gave a

2141
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:29,520
talk until

2142
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:32,960
i think it was 2006 and um

2143
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,960
and it was really because i didn't

2144
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,719
believe that there was anything i could

2145
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:37,520
talk about

2146
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,440
that hadn't been done before or if i

2147
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,840
wasn't dropping zero day during my talk

2148
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,119
you know with the circles that i was

2149
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:45,040
moving in that that

2150
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:47,119
you know nobody would would be

2151
01:34:47,119 --> 01:34:48,960
interested in what i had to say

2152
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:50,960
so i would say you know first for sure

2153
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,960
now if you're just getting started

2154
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:55,679
go give a talk i mean who cares uh talk

2155
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:57,360
about you know your first year in

2156
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:58,800
infosec or

2157
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,800
breaking into the industry of

2158
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,159
information security

2159
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:04,000
those would be fascinating talks and

2160
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,760
guaranteed lots of people would be

2161
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,400
interested in what you have to say

2162
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:13,199
excellent what would you say has been

2163
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:15,119
have you had any twists in your career

2164
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:16,960
has there been something you were on a

2165
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:17,520
path

2166
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,360
you know maybe it was working a big

2167
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:20,800
incident or

2168
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,320
maybe it was you know working for a

2169
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,239
specific company and just that left turn

2170
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:27,119
came out of nowhere

2171
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:29,199
does anyone have a story around that

2172
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:30,320
just kind of that that

2173
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,320
that quick change of of going into

2174
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:33,520
something and going

2175
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,239
wow here we go

2176
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:41,040
so i made a transition from being

2177
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,040
what i refer to as a practitioner

2178
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:45,360
meaning like on a security team

2179
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,360
with the job of you know protecting and

2180
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:49,119
defending that organization

2181
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:50,480
and then i switched over to the vendor

2182
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,880
side and those are really different

2183
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,320
roles and when i

2184
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:57,280
had originally been on kind of security

2185
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:59,360
teams and leading security teams

2186
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:01,679
i thought that that was sort of the type

2187
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:03,920
of role that i was always interested in

2188
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:07,199
um i find that

2189
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:13,840
i find that being on the vendor side

2190
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:18,000
gives me easier wins

2191
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,159
if that makes any sense i feel like

2192
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:21,840
being on the practitioner side it's sort

2193
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:22,960
of like

2194
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:26,400
all of the problems all of the time and

2195
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:29,760
that is incredibly valuable they're such

2196
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:30,000
an

2197
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,400
awesome opportunity for learning um at

2198
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:33,840
the same time

2199
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:36,800
there's also like thousands of security

2200
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:37,760
vendors

2201
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:40,080
trying to like buy you dinner and like

2202
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,679
be your best friend and

2203
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:43,280
so there's there can also be especially

2204
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,760
if you're sort of in a budget owning

2205
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:47,440
management type of position there can

2206
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:50,159
also be this like weird

2207
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:53,199
vibe and i thought i wanted those things

2208
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:53,679
you know

2209
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:56,880
but i will say like on the

2210
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:00,000
vendor side um there are these

2211
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,719
business goals that can be achieved and

2212
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:04,400
when those business goals get achieved

2213
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:05,600
or even exceeded

2214
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:08,800
it feels super good um so i

2215
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:11,440
i think that for me i kind of earlier in

2216
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:14,000
my career thought i would always be

2217
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,719
leading security teams uh and it turns

2218
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:18,320
out i actually

2219
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:21,199
love uh being on the vendor side and

2220
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:23,040
specializing in focusing on

2221
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,679
one particular problem uh rather than

2222
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:27,119
being in a situation where

2223
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:29,600
my job is to manage all of the problems

2224
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:32,159
all the time

2225
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,480
awesome jeffrey i think you had a little

2226
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,480
more to add yeah well i took

2227
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:39,920
uh i took a leap uh when i left search

2228
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,920
and um uh moved from incident response

2229
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:46,560
to product security working for

2230
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:48,320
royal phillips doing product security

2231
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,159
for medical devices so that was back

2232
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:50,719
when

2233
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:53,760
that was just becoming uh

2234
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:57,520
a bigger issue and that was great

2235
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:58,800
experience for me was completely

2236
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:00,880
different than what i had been doing

2237
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,800
at cert but i realized several things

2238
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,040
while i was there one

2239
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:06,800
i missed managing people because that

2240
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:09,199
was not a people leader role and it was

2241
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:10,800
unlikely based on the people that were

2242
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,239
already in positions there that i was

2243
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:13,520
going to get to a people

2244
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:16,639
leader role soon and i realized i missed

2245
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:18,560
instant response so i was only there for

2246
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,880
three years and then moved to

2247
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:25,360
to to secure works but that helped me

2248
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:28,320
figure out what i really wanted because

2249
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,239
after 20 years at cert

2250
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:32,400
it kind of like clouded my mind as to

2251
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:34,080
what i really wanted to

2252
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:36,000
do in the future and that really uh it

2253
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,760
was a great experience but it helped me

2254
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:39,440
realize that that wasn't the experience

2255
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:40,480
that i really

2256
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:42,719
wanted and it helped me move to a to a

2257
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:43,600
role that

2258
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:47,040
that was more fulfilling for me

2259
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:50,239
excellent thank you jeffrey

2260
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:54,480
katie any uh any twists in your career

2261
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:58,320
so twisted

2262
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,719
we've got a few minutes if you you know

2263
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:02,320
depending on how

2264
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:05,360
to to elaborate on that um you know i

2265
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:06,320
would say that

2266
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:09,520
um it was it was certainly

2267
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:12,639
my seven years at microsoft were one the

2268
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:14,400
duration of time that i spent at

2269
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,560
microsoft was a surprise even to me

2270
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,639
right um you know i had been a linux

2271
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:20,719
developer at the turn of the millennium

2272
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:22,560
and the fact that i joined microsoft at

2273
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:24,000
all felt odd

2274
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,480
to me but you know they they were

2275
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,400
expanding roles and

2276
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,560
and i was shifting and trying to decide

2277
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,560
what i wanted to do next because after a

2278
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:33,360
while

2279
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:36,639
breaking into computers while fun um

2280
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:38,800
it gets repetitive it gets boring and

2281
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:40,000
especially when

2282
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,199
you're seeing the same classes of

2283
01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:42,800
vulnerabilities over and over again so i

2284
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:43,520
would say

2285
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:46,159
maybe the biggest twist and and surprise

2286
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:47,040
in my career

2287
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,920
is that we haven't solved basic you know

2288
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,520
injection flaw problems

2289
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,679
right whole classes of vulnerabilities

2290
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:54,639
that i thought

2291
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:57,360
for sure surely an ancient hacker such

2292
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,840
as myself cannot still break into things

2293
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:02,000
but i mean i hacked clubhouse recently

2294
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,440
that new audio app

2295
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:05,760
was just like huh all right then you

2296
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:06,719
know i guess

2297
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:10,000
the more things change the more vc will

2298
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:10,560
back

2299
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:12,960
whatever you know and um and i think the

2300
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,400
the twists and turns in my career have

2301
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:15,440
just been

2302
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:19,040
um absorbing the way that things are

2303
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:20,000
evolving

2304
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,719
while still staying so fundamentally

2305
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:23,679
basic

2306
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:27,199
that um you know it is it is such a

2307
01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:30,639
breadth of um the haves and have-nots

2308
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:33,119
and wendy nather uses the term security

2309
01:40:33,119 --> 01:40:34,400
poverty line

2310
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:37,360
and um i i would say i use the term

2311
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:38,800
security one percent

2312
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,560
you know because it's only the largest

2313
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:42,080
organizations that

2314
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:44,480
have the money and resources and vision

2315
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,480
and have been forced you know by

2316
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,480
harsh reality to truly invest in

2317
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:50,080
security and have these specialized

2318
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:53,199
roles you actually don't see a lot of of

2319
01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:55,760
security specialized roles downstream in

2320
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:57,440
the ecosystem of vendors

2321
01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:00,320
um you know i think sean you and i

2322
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,280
didn't overlap

2323
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:03,520
at microsoft at the same time but you

2324
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:06,000
know the exact grind that i'm talking

2325
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,520
about in terms of

2326
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,280
you know the the security response team

2327
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:12,320
but i think it was 2007 popular science

2328
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:15,040
called microsoft security grunt one of

2329
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:17,280
the top 10 worst jobs in science and it

2330
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,440
was between elephant vasectomist

2331
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,679
and whale feces researcher and it was

2332
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:22,560
not a lie

2333
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:25,760
and we got t-shirts so i mean maybe this

2334
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,520
is a convoluted and twisted answer to

2335
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:28,800
your question but

2336
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:31,199
um i would just say the entirety of my

2337
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:33,840
career has been full of surprises and i

2338
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:37,199
i expect it will continue to be so

2339
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:39,280
i believe i still have that t-shirt and

2340
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:41,040
having been a volunteer at a marine lab

2341
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:43,040
and having dealt in whale feces i will

2342
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,480
say the incident response

2343
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:46,400
job was definitely some days a little

2344
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,799
worse

2345
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:53,040
nazira how about you any twists

2346
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:55,679
um nothing really big twist i mean um i

2347
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:56,080
think

2348
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:58,000
going back to what katie said earlier i

2349
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,320
mean i spent 10 years at emc

2350
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:03,840
and slash right so i was alone so when i

2351
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:06,639
made that switch um it wasn't easy for

2352
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:07,040
me

2353
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:08,960
it was like let go ten years you know

2354
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:11,520
you build the team you build the program

2355
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:15,199
you know um everybody knows you in

2356
01:42:15,199 --> 01:42:17,360
in you know leaving all that and

2357
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:18,239
starting

2358
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:21,280
kind of new it was scary um

2359
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:23,199
but i you know i think it was necessary

2360
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:24,960
for me um

2361
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:27,440
to learn new things and it was you know

2362
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:28,239
personal

2363
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:30,800
decisions as well so but i guess it's

2364
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,639
just um

2365
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:36,239
don't be afraid to make big changes um

2366
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:38,560
obviously you know get the input get the

2367
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,239
information you need to

2368
01:42:40,239 --> 01:42:43,520
to make those um you know decisions but

2369
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:46,159
just don't be scared um sometimes you

2370
01:42:46,159 --> 01:42:48,239
have to make big decisions

2371
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:50,159
and and sometimes jumping out of those

2372
01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:52,480
uh like carolyn was mentioning earlier

2373
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:54,880
those uncomfortable bad

2374
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:56,960
areas and jumping into something new is

2375
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:58,000
scary but

2376
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,400
also very rewarding yeah i mean in my

2377
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:01,920
case it wasn't bad right i had a great

2378
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:03,040
career right it was

2379
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:06,159
me leaving a great team great career and

2380
01:43:06,159 --> 01:43:07,119
starting fresh

2381
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:09,280
um and that was a big decision for me

2382
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:10,239
but

2383
01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:11,840
um i think sometimes you have to make

2384
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:14,000
those decisions to keep learning

2385
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,679
and yeah what would what would make you

2386
01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:17,199
kind of go from doing something that's

2387
01:43:17,199 --> 01:43:17,920
good

2388
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:19,840
and then you're enjoying it all to

2389
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:21,440
trying something completely new and kind

2390
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:23,679
of scary

2391
01:43:23,679 --> 01:43:26,080
uh for me it was uh both you know

2392
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:27,040
personal decision

2393
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:30,400
uh commute when

2394
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:32,400
kukovic wasn't there um my committee was

2395
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,320
gonna be like really really and i have

2396
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:34,800
you know

2397
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,199
um i had a kid going to kindergarten so

2398
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:38,320
it was you know a lot of it was a

2399
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:39,679
personal incision as well

2400
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:41,520
but from the professional one it's just

2401
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:43,679
um i was an instant response as well

2402
01:43:43,679 --> 01:43:46,239
for a very very long time and my new

2403
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:47,520
role wasn't going to be an incident

2404
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:48,639
response

2405
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:50,480
i mean yes we're going to support you

2406
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:52,000
know be supporting the response but it

2407
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:52,639
wasn't

2408
01:43:52,639 --> 01:43:56,159
me making you know um

2409
01:43:56,159 --> 01:43:58,000
calls at night making decisions on

2410
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,679
incidents it was like it's gonna be

2411
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:01,440
completely different

2412
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:04,320
um and i was also moving from on-prem as

2413
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:05,920
you know emc and dell it's like

2414
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:08,320
reselling hardware and software

2415
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:11,119
i'm going to full cloud so those were

2416
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:12,159
the things for me

2417
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:14,239
um you know it was a learning

2418
01:44:14,239 --> 01:44:15,760
opportunity for me to learn

2419
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:18,639
a completely different things awesome

2420
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:21,840
awesome thank you

2421
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:24,719
we've seen a lot and katie mentioned

2422
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:26,639
earlier all of the different

2423
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:29,280
ransomwares that are going on and we've

2424
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:30,960
had a few more incidents

2425
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:33,440
in industry-wide incidents i think just

2426
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,280
in the last couple months

2427
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:37,920
half a year than i'd seen in a while and

2428
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:39,360
i know we've been seeing numbers of

2429
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:41,760
incidents going up and up and up

2430
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:44,400
what can practitioners and companies do

2431
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:46,080
better

2432
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:49,280
whether it's championing championing

2433
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:53,199
new talent uh trying to fix

2434
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:55,040
you know the path they're on i mean

2435
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,719
katie you had mentioned earlier the one

2436
01:44:56,719 --> 01:44:57,280
percent

2437
01:44:57,280 --> 01:45:00,320
how most companies unless they're very

2438
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:01,760
large and and have

2439
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:04,000
had incidents in the past aren't really

2440
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:04,880
even scaled

2441
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:06,560
to to deal with the kinds of incidents

2442
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,000
we're facing right now it's

2443
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,760
so what what should we be doing better

2444
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:12,880
what should we be looking at

2445
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:15,840
well i can start you know honestly no

2446
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,920
matter how small your company is

2447
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:20,159
multi-factor authenticate all the things

2448
01:45:20,159 --> 01:45:22,400
just please multi-factor authenticate

2449
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:23,920
all the things and um

2450
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:25,920
and and you will be in a lot better

2451
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,119
shape um

2452
01:45:27,119 --> 01:45:29,440
and certainly um some of the ransomware

2453
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:31,040
attacks that we've seen

2454
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:33,119
multi-factor authentication probably

2455
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:34,480
would have would have um

2456
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:36,320
you know made the attackers move on to

2457
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:38,239
the next target um

2458
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:40,320
and then the only other thing that i

2459
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:41,360
would say

2460
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:45,440
is that as your organization grows

2461
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:47,440
attempt to grow your security

2462
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:48,800
capabilities

2463
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:52,159
in step with you know proportionately

2464
01:45:52,159 --> 01:45:54,800
to the risks that not just your company

2465
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:56,800
is facing but that your users if you are

2466
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:59,040
a producer of technology

2467
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,440
are facing so that was my one beef with

2468
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,199
clubhouse you know was

2469
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:06,639
that they had millions of users and

2470
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:08,400
at the time that i contacted them to

2471
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:10,080
report the security vulnerabilities that

2472
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:11,040
i found

2473
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:12,880
they had fewer employees than i did

2474
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:14,639
total and you know they

2475
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:18,000
were already at the four billion dollar

2476
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
you know rumors of acquisition by

2477
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,920
twitter four billion dollar mark

2478
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,679
so that's a disproportionate growth of

2479
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:25,679
your security capabilities if i ever saw

2480
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:26,719
one

2481
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:28,800
and i think that our industry

2482
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:31,040
unfortunately is incentivized towards

2483
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:33,679
you know building the features scaling

2484
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:35,840
getting the users getting the data

2485
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,840
before you know organizations have had a

2486
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,119
chance to

2487
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:42,400
take a serious look at their security so

2488
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,719
trying to stay in proportion with your

2489
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:46,800
risk and your problem set will help a

2490
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,560
lot of small companies and

2491
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:50,560
hopefully they don't get so big that

2492
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:52,480
they are surprised by a middle aged

2493
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:54,239
hacker who happened to find some stuff

2494
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:56,639
along with my cat who is here by the way

2495
01:46:56,639 --> 01:46:59,280
and threatening this very this very

2496
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:00,960
panel that we are on he may make an

2497
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:01,600
appearance

2498
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:05,440
we may get hacked oh goodness okay

2499
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:11,199
any anyone else things

2500
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:13,040
yeah if i can just stand and i agree

2501
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:14,719
with katie i mean the most

2502
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:16,639
most companies are making still some of

2503
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:18,080
the most basic

2504
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:20,960
errors so it's not like they need you

2505
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,280
know

2506
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:23,760
the most cutting-edge thing that they

2507
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:25,040
don't have the basics down

2508
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:26,800
i think the other thing that i would add

2509
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,239
is this is where

2510
01:47:28,239 --> 01:47:30,400
i think communication and collaboration

2511
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:31,520
are very

2512
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:34,400
important as practitioners making sure

2513
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:36,320
that your business partners others in

2514
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,199
the business

2515
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:40,560
understand what some of the the choices

2516
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:42,560
that they make what the risks actually

2517
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:42,960
are

2518
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:45,199
and helping communicate that upward

2519
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:46,159
become very

2520
01:47:46,159 --> 01:47:48,880
important and if you cannot effectively

2521
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:51,280
communicate and you can't collaborate

2522
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:54,400
with others uh or you take a very

2523
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:57,440
you know you know brusque attitude

2524
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:58,960
towards people that you think don't get

2525
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,960
it um

2526
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:02,719
you're not really gonna advance your

2527
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:04,159
your organization

2528
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:06,560
and maybe even not advance your career

2529
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:07,440
if you

2530
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:09,199
if you don't so i think those are very

2531
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:11,280
important factors in helping

2532
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:16,320
move a company forward awesome carolyn

2533
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:18,800
i totally agree with katie and jeffrey i

2534
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:19,760
think that

2535
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:21,840
it is really important to focus on the

2536
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:22,880
basics

2537
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:24,800
it is really important to try and get

2538
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:27,520
the investment that's appropriate

2539
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,520
one of the ways that i recommend that

2540
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,040
folks

2541
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:34,159
try to get the resources

2542
01:48:34,159 --> 01:48:37,199
that's appropriate for an organization

2543
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:41,119
you know 15 years ago

2544
01:48:41,119 --> 01:48:43,600
a security and then a security incident

2545
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:44,159
in the news

2546
01:48:44,159 --> 01:48:46,480
was like a very big deal uh and i would

2547
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:48,000
say like today it's still a very big

2548
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:48,960
deal but it's also

2549
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:51,040
increasingly common and we are kind of

2550
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:53,040
used to it

2551
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:55,440
there's an opportunity for us as

2552
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:57,280
security practitioners

2553
01:48:57,280 --> 01:49:00,239
to leverage recent incidents to explain

2554
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:02,080
to people who are not security

2555
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:03,520
practitioners

2556
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:06,400
how this could happen at our place maybe

2557
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:08,400
not like this exact same thing

2558
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:11,760
but sort of an underlying theme and how

2559
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:13,360
that applies

2560
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:16,000
and i think that uh you know to to

2561
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,719
jeffrey's point about

2562
01:49:17,719 --> 01:49:20,719
communication and collaboration

2563
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:25,199
i continue to see security people

2564
01:49:25,199 --> 01:49:28,320
wanting so much

2565
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:30,639
to speak the language of the business

2566
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:33,040
and and just having a tough time with it

2567
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:38,080
um and and to those folks uh i would say

2568
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:40,480
learn everything you can about how your

2569
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:44,159
organization works to achieve its goals

2570
01:49:44,159 --> 01:49:47,599
and also sort of leverage current

2571
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:50,800
incidents and what happened so that you

2572
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:52,719
can tell stories

2573
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:55,119
that are interesting and relevant about

2574
01:49:55,119 --> 01:49:56,719
what may be going on

2575
01:49:56,719 --> 01:49:59,679
in your organization

2576
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:03,440
zera yeah i just want to add on

2577
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:06,719
i think um a lot of us i think sometimes

2578
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:08,960
forget to bring our

2579
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:11,920
end customers and user along to our

2580
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:12,480
journey

2581
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:15,520
right um because a lot of things

2582
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:16,719
you know especially in the software

2583
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:18,080
industry we make a lot of things

2584
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:19,920
available but if they're not used by our

2585
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:21,360
end customers and users

2586
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:23,360
they're useless right so sometimes we

2587
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:24,639
forget about that and

2588
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:28,000
you know so we need to bring you know

2589
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,440
them along so be making things

2590
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:33,520
easier for them to use or just basic

2591
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:35,119
education

2592
01:50:35,119 --> 01:50:37,920
like you know i'm sure you guys could

2593
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:39,840
read like so many incidents things

2594
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:41,599
related because customers didn't use the

2595
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:42,800
certain things that was already

2596
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:43,520
available

2597
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:46,639
for them to to use um so i mean i've

2598
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:48,159
been doing so many so i think

2599
01:50:48,159 --> 01:50:49,920
sometimes we forget that so we need to

2600
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:52,320
always um and also we need to hear from

2601
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:53,840
them right we need to hear like

2602
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,440
why they are using some of the security

2603
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:56,880
features we're making them available is

2604
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:57,920
it hard for them

2605
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:00,000
like what other things so i think we

2606
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,440
need to bring that

2607
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:04,000
feedback from our end and end users and

2608
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,360
customers and sometimes

2609
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:06,800
we forget as a security practitioner

2610
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:10,400
because we are so focused internally

2611
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:11,679
i think too also like you were

2612
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:13,679
mentioning you know bringing the

2613
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:16,560
external and the internal folks

2614
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:18,639
along for the ride i think the the the

2615
01:51:18,639 --> 01:51:20,719
biggest thing i got to do was taking my

2616
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:22,320
head of calms out for a beer one night

2617
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:23,840
and just explaining kind of

2618
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:25,760
how things can go sideways in in the

2619
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:26,960
media and

2620
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:29,679
uh it was very helpful to to get them on

2621
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:32,080
board with things that need to change

2622
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:34,400
um let's move a little bit more to roles

2623
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,199
so we

2624
01:51:35,199 --> 01:51:37,679
you all have had certainly different

2625
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:39,440
roles and and different parts in your

2626
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:40,239
career

2627
01:51:40,239 --> 01:51:43,280
how are you seeing roles evolving um

2628
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:44,719
are you seeing the industry going in a

2629
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:47,599
certain direction with security roles

2630
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:49,920
are you seeing places that are you know

2631
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:51,760
being left behind that were missing

2632
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:54,960
or seeing maybe too much attention in

2633
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:56,719
one area versus another what

2634
01:51:56,719 --> 01:51:59,840
how are you all seeing it

2635
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:03,920
katie i see a lot of attention

2636
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:06,080
on the hacking side of things and myself

2637
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:07,760
as a hacker you know i thought

2638
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:09,760
wow this is paradise you know or i would

2639
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:12,000
have thought that this is this is what

2640
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,639
present me uh middle aged hacker me

2641
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:16,080
would have thought about it but

2642
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:18,159
um in fact it's an unbalanced equation

2643
01:52:18,159 --> 01:52:20,159
you know people are obsessed with zero

2644
01:52:20,159 --> 01:52:22,159
days and obsessed with hacking

2645
01:52:22,159 --> 01:52:24,080
um and they're not really understanding

2646
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:25,840
that knowing about a flaw

2647
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:27,920
is is less than half the battle there

2648
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:30,239
are so many other security jobs

2649
01:52:30,239 --> 01:52:33,280
that are so important and they're on the

2650
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:36,320
um defense side or or on the offense

2651
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:39,280
in in order to um you know help train

2652
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:40,719
the defense side

2653
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:42,880
um and so i think that's that's one

2654
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,320
major thing

2655
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:46,320
you know major theme that that i see

2656
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:48,480
people kind of focusing the wrong

2657
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:50,480
kinds of security attention when they do

2658
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:52,080
finally start paying attention to

2659
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:54,000
security you know um

2660
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,960
uh not to beat up on clubhouse but maybe

2661
01:52:56,960 --> 01:52:58,080
a little bit to beat up

2662
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:01,199
on the vc model of growth first um

2663
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:02,960
they didn't have a security team which

2664
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:04,480
you know is understandable when they had

2665
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:05,040
under 10

2666
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:07,440
employees at the time but they had a bug

2667
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:08,080
bounty

2668
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:11,119
and that seemed like a crazy place to

2669
01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:13,280
be investing your early security dollars

2670
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:15,360
i mean absolutely insane

2671
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:18,560
so um you know i think that

2672
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:20,480
the other major thing that our industry

2673
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:22,400
is shifting towards you know not just

2674
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:24,800
this you know sort of been an ongoing

2675
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:25,599
theme of being

2676
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:28,880
obsessed with hacking right um but

2677
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:31,280
something else is that there are hardly

2678
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:32,080
any in

2679
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:34,239
entry-level security positions and i

2680
01:53:34,239 --> 01:53:35,920
think that's a huge mistake

2681
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:37,840
um when caroline was talking about the

2682
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:39,760
fact that like there were entry-level

2683
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:41,360
security positions at a major

2684
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:44,560
tech company that it was like oh yeah

2685
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:46,560
those were rare even back then

2686
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:48,639
um because what little security dollars

2687
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:50,400
you have it makes sense from an

2688
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:51,679
organizational perspective they're

2689
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:53,520
trying to get the most experience

2690
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:55,199
biggest bang for their buck candidate

2691
01:53:55,199 --> 01:53:57,199
they can but what they're missing

2692
01:53:57,199 --> 01:53:59,760
is opportunities to train people who are

2693
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:00,239
there

2694
01:54:00,239 --> 01:54:02,560
not in a security role already but want

2695
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:04,159
to move into security

2696
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:05,920
so they're missing a huge opportunity of

2697
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:07,440
their existing personnel

2698
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:09,280
and they're also missing you know

2699
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:10,639
opportunities to

2700
01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:13,040
recruit and train uh some folks who are

2701
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:14,239
in entry-level

2702
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:15,599
you know certain would be appropriate

2703
01:54:15,599 --> 01:54:17,280
for entry-level security jobs

2704
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:19,920
i think that's a major pipeline problem

2705
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:20,880
um and i heard

2706
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:22,480
at some point you know there's what

2707
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:24,320
something like 3.1

2708
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:26,400
unfilled cybersecurity jobs in the

2709
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:27,520
entire world

2710
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:29,440
around half a million of them are in the

2711
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:31,040
united states alone

2712
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:34,400
and um i was hearing that over a million

2713
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:35,199
candidates

2714
01:54:35,199 --> 01:54:38,320
tend to be competing for the same 10

2715
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:42,320
000 or so entry-level security jobs so

2716
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:44,159
what do we need to do differently in our

2717
01:54:44,159 --> 01:54:46,800
industry have more entry-level jobs

2718
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:49,840
and do a lot more lateral training from

2719
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:51,440
within organizations

2720
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:53,679
to not just educate everybody more about

2721
01:54:53,679 --> 01:54:55,840
security but actually to pull from the

2722
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:56,639
business

2723
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:58,159
and they know their area of the business

2724
01:54:58,159 --> 01:55:00,719
very well and pull them into security

2725
01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:02,400
i think that's a great point katie and i

2726
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:03,679
know one of the things i've heard in the

2727
01:55:03,679 --> 01:55:04,080
past

2728
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:05,840
is well i'm going to train them up and

2729
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:06,960
then they're going to go leave and make

2730
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:08,560
more money at another company what do

2731
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:10,960
you say to that

2732
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:13,599
let them leave if you can yes good

2733
01:55:13,599 --> 01:55:14,800
that's good

2734
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:16,560
yeah if you can't compel them with

2735
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:18,719
enough benefits and reasons to stay in

2736
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:20,159
career opportunities

2737
01:55:20,159 --> 01:55:21,840
then they should go and you should

2738
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:23,679
namaste them right out the door

2739
01:55:23,679 --> 01:55:26,960
you know jeffrey

2740
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:29,840
no i completely agree i you know we

2741
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:31,760
training is extremely important for us

2742
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:32,159
we

2743
01:55:32,159 --> 01:55:34,080
it's one of those sacrosanct things that

2744
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:36,239
doesn't doesn't get touched you have to

2745
01:55:36,239 --> 01:55:37,679
help people learn to grow this industry

2746
01:55:37,679 --> 01:55:38,560
is changing too

2747
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:41,520
fast if you don't and you you leave the

2748
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:42,639
people

2749
01:55:42,639 --> 01:55:44,400
they're not only disgruntled but then

2750
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:46,080
they're not able to do the job anymore

2751
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:47,760
because everything's changed around them

2752
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:49,679
and they haven't haven't learned i also

2753
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:51,280
completely agree with katie about entry

2754
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:51,920
level

2755
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:53,360
there's a really good article in the

2756
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:54,960
australia financial review

2757
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:56,719
about a week ago talking about how

2758
01:55:56,719 --> 01:55:58,840
businesses are starting to turn towards

2759
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:00,320
non-traditional

2760
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:02,880
uh backgrounds in to bring them into

2761
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:03,679
security

2762
01:56:03,679 --> 01:56:05,040
psychology was one of the things they

2763
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:06,239
were talking about bringing people with

2764
01:56:06,239 --> 01:56:08,080
psychology skills and then training them

2765
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:09,280
on other things

2766
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:11,599
we have to in this in this industry we

2767
01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:13,040
have to have to do that

2768
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:14,800
the other other thing that i would note

2769
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:16,719
is things are a lot more collaborative

2770
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:18,320
today than they were when i started in

2771
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:19,199
security

2772
01:56:19,199 --> 01:56:21,679
many many years ago you have to be a

2773
01:56:21,679 --> 01:56:22,800
team player

2774
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:24,800
these things are so complicated when you

2775
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:26,880
get into these situations no one person

2776
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:28,639
can be able to solve these things alone

2777
01:56:28,639 --> 01:56:30,320
so you have to have the people with

2778
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:32,159
skills when i'm interviewing people

2779
01:56:32,159 --> 01:56:33,440
collaboration

2780
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:35,119
and ability to communicate with that's

2781
01:56:35,119 --> 01:56:36,800
the most important thing i look for when

2782
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:37,119
i'm

2783
01:56:37,119 --> 01:56:39,440
when i'm interviewing for people because

2784
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:41,280
the days of having a single person go in

2785
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:42,480
the closet

2786
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:44,400
you know slide pieces under the door and

2787
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:45,520
then they come out with the answers

2788
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:46,320
those are long

2789
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:49,199
those are long gone

2790
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:55,440
awesome carolyn i think that

2791
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:58,480
our industry has a

2792
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:01,280
challenge when it comes to writing job

2793
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:02,639
descriptions

2794
01:57:02,639 --> 01:57:06,480
i think we are not so good at that

2795
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:08,719
and i think it's super hard both for the

2796
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:10,080
hiring manager

2797
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:13,360
and for the candidate there is an

2798
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:16,880
opportunity here i think um

2799
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:20,480
i do think that some hiring managers

2800
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:23,840
have a tendency to rely on

2801
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:27,119
teams and recruiters to help them um

2802
01:57:27,119 --> 01:57:30,159
and i think that trying to fill a

2803
01:57:30,159 --> 01:57:32,239
security role

2804
01:57:32,239 --> 01:57:34,480
is is pretty different from trying to

2805
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:36,159
fill a lot of other different roles for

2806
01:57:36,159 --> 01:57:38,560
a lot of different reasons

2807
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:41,040
and there's all these mismatches you

2808
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,280
know and i do think that

2809
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:45,599
if we as an industry could get better at

2810
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:47,520
writing job descriptions like

2811
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:49,760
figuring out actually what it is that we

2812
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:51,840
need and want and then writing it down

2813
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:53,119
clearly

2814
01:57:53,119 --> 01:57:55,599
then then that would that would help i

2815
01:57:55,599 --> 01:57:56,800
think that's i think that's very

2816
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:58,080
difficult and i think it's super

2817
01:57:58,080 --> 01:57:58,960
difficult

2818
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:00,880
both on the hiring manager side as well

2819
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:02,480
as the candidate side i mean it is

2820
01:58:02,480 --> 01:58:04,800
absurd that on one hand we've got like

2821
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:06,480
three million unfilled jobs

2822
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:08,480
and however many million people who

2823
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:10,239
really want these jobs and we can't

2824
01:58:10,239 --> 01:58:13,599
do the matching um so that i think uh

2825
01:58:13,599 --> 01:58:16,080
is an unsolved opportunity i think you

2826
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:17,679
had a great point there too about

2827
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:20,560
you know involving hr and do you see

2828
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:22,960
that maybe that hr

2829
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:24,719
they're more generalist and maybe not as

2830
01:58:24,719 --> 01:58:26,480
used to dealing with

2831
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:28,480
the security personality that we

2832
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:31,119
sometimes see in the industry or

2833
01:58:31,119 --> 01:58:34,239
so i had another super um

2834
01:58:34,239 --> 01:58:36,960
unexpected twist in my role a couple of

2835
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:39,119
years ago which is to say

2836
01:58:39,119 --> 01:58:41,199
i now have 16 years of experience in

2837
01:58:41,199 --> 01:58:42,880
information security

2838
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:44,719
and i'm also the head of people at my

2839
01:58:44,719 --> 01:58:46,800
company right now which means i oversee

2840
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:49,840
people operations and talent acquisition

2841
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:53,920
and i think the the it's actually

2842
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:57,440
a data problem and what i mean by that

2843
01:58:57,440 --> 01:58:57,920
is

2844
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:02,000
if you're like a recruiter or a

2845
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,280
people ops person there's there's like

2846
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:08,239
data that you can get about roles and

2847
01:59:08,239 --> 01:59:10,639
locations and levels

2848
01:59:10,639 --> 01:59:12,960
and that data for security is sort of

2849
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:14,159
all over the place

2850
01:59:14,159 --> 01:59:17,360
and so what happens a lot is that

2851
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:19,760
security rules get categorized

2852
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:21,360
incorrectly

2853
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:23,920
and then you're actually looking for a

2854
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:24,960
person

2855
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:28,480
at such and such level but the way that

2856
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:30,719
your compensation band is structured

2857
01:59:30,719 --> 01:59:33,280
it's at such and such other level and

2858
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:33,840
and there's

2859
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:37,119
there's a severe lack of data

2860
01:59:37,119 --> 01:59:39,679
um so i i think that that's really uh

2861
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:41,520
where folks struggle that and i think

2862
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:42,639
that

2863
01:59:42,639 --> 01:59:45,040
i think that hiring managers you know a

2864
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:47,119
hiring manager

2865
01:59:47,119 --> 01:59:50,560
is a hiring manager in security is not

2866
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:51,760
only hiring

2867
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:53,840
a team for security they're also

2868
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:55,360
managing their team

2869
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:56,800
trying to keep everyone emotionally

2870
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:59,360
afloat doing their job putting out fires

2871
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:01,119
trying to train trying to strategize

2872
02:00:01,119 --> 02:00:02,320
trying to ask for money

2873
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:04,639
and so the recruiting and the focus on

2874
02:00:04,639 --> 02:00:06,560
that ends up being

2875
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:09,040
maybe like five percent of a person's

2876
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:10,239
job

2877
02:00:10,239 --> 02:00:12,960
and and i actually have come to learn

2878
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:13,760
that

2879
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:15,679
for a hiring manager if you're going to

2880
02:00:15,679 --> 02:00:17,440
do a very good job at recruiting

2881
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:20,880
it takes at least 25 of a person's job i

2882
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:21,440
think

2883
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:23,920
and so there's there's kind of not

2884
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:24,960
enough time and it's

2885
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:27,040
difficult to prioritize the time that it

2886
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:28,800
takes i think to do well which is

2887
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:30,880
where you get sort of like these

2888
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:32,560
copy-paste job descriptions that don't

2889
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:34,239
actually match what you're looking for

2890
02:00:34,239 --> 02:00:36,239
where you get sort of a lack of

2891
02:00:36,239 --> 02:00:38,239
justifying an appropriate level for what

2892
02:00:38,239 --> 02:00:40,239
you're actually looking for or you

2893
02:00:40,239 --> 02:00:43,440
you're maybe don't have the space

2894
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:46,320
and the time to brainstorm like oh

2895
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:48,239
instead of this like one senior role

2896
02:00:48,239 --> 02:00:50,080
could i sort of like break it up into

2897
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:51,920
two or three more junior roles and have

2898
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:52,480
folks

2899
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:54,560
you know specialize you know all of

2900
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:55,599
those things take

2901
02:00:55,599 --> 02:00:58,719
time and one of the things that security

2902
02:00:58,719 --> 02:00:59,920
hiring managers

2903
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:03,040
don't have a lot of his time okay i want

2904
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:03,520
to

2905
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:05,280
share one tip with the hiring manager if

2906
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,199
you don't mind that works for me and it

2907
02:01:07,199 --> 02:01:09,199
will save you a lot of time

2908
02:01:09,199 --> 02:01:11,679
spend 30 minutes to do live sourcing

2909
02:01:11,679 --> 02:01:12,560
with a recruiter

2910
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:14,400
once right once you have a job

2911
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:16,000
description spend 30 minutes

2912
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,199
do live sourcing and it helped

2913
02:01:19,199 --> 02:01:20,800
tremendously then you don't have to

2914
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:22,639
waste your time reviewing

2915
02:01:22,639 --> 02:01:24,480
hundreds and hundreds of resumes that do

2916
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:25,920
not match what you want

2917
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:28,480
so invest that time upfront do live

2918
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:29,760
sourcing

2919
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:33,040
and it will help you a lot

2920
02:01:33,040 --> 02:01:35,520
so that's one tip that has been helping

2921
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:36,239
me

2922
02:01:36,239 --> 02:01:39,599
excellent excellent thank you you know

2923
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:41,520
we so we we've talked about kind of how

2924
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:43,520
everybody got into their careers and the

2925
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:44,080
twists

2926
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:47,040
and the roles what keeps you all up at

2927
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:48,400
night

2928
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:50,639
you know i i it like we've mentioned

2929
02:01:50,639 --> 02:01:52,239
there's still nothing's

2930
02:01:52,239 --> 02:01:55,360
it nothing seems to have been solved

2931
02:01:55,360 --> 02:01:56,880
we're still doing a lot of the same

2932
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:59,360
things if not at the larger levels all

2933
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:00,080
the all the

2934
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:01,840
newer and smaller companies coming up

2935
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:03,760
what what kind of

2936
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:06,800
makes you fear a little bit

2937
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:11,679
okay besides the obvious answer scappy

2938
02:02:11,679 --> 02:02:13,920
the cat keeps me up at night which is

2939
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:17,040
absolutely true um i would say you know

2940
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:18,080
honestly

2941
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:20,000
national security's been on my mind for

2942
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,639
a very long time and the fact that

2943
02:02:22,639 --> 02:02:26,400
um our incident responders especially

2944
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:29,760
at the federal level are under resourced

2945
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:32,480
they are understaffed they lack the

2946
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:34,080
people process and tech

2947
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:36,960
to do their jobs effectively um that

2948
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:37,440
really

2949
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:40,880
concerns me and um you know i gave

2950
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:43,119
testimony before congress a couple weeks

2951
02:02:43,119 --> 02:02:43,599
ago

2952
02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:47,040
on supply chain software supply chain um

2953
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:49,679
security and you know the fact that the

2954
02:02:49,679 --> 02:02:51,280
recent executive order in the united

2955
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:53,040
states covers cyber security

2956
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:55,119
to such a great extent is wonderful on

2957
02:02:55,119 --> 02:02:56,880
the one hand but it's also

2958
02:02:56,880 --> 02:02:59,920
you know kind of like it's almost like

2959
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:01,360
turning to the federal government in the

2960
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:02,880
private sector and saying

2961
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:05,119
have you considered being more secure

2962
02:03:05,119 --> 02:03:06,159
because this is what

2963
02:03:06,159 --> 02:03:07,679
you know this is what you should do is

2964
02:03:07,679 --> 02:03:09,360
be more secure now

2965
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:11,440
and it's you know to me it just feels

2966
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:12,400
like

2967
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:15,679
there's so there's been so little

2968
02:03:15,679 --> 02:03:17,679
consistent investment

2969
02:03:17,679 --> 02:03:19,840
across administrations across the

2970
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:21,280
private industry

2971
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:24,400
that ransomware is just one

2972
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:27,520
very loud symptom of a problem that we

2973
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:30,400
on this panel have known has just been

2974
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:32,320
simmering this entire time

2975
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:34,800
you know so what keeps me up at night

2976
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:36,320
it's that we've reached the boiling

2977
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:36,719
point

2978
02:03:36,719 --> 02:03:40,239
and it's you know there's no better time

2979
02:03:40,239 --> 02:03:42,239
to get into cyber security if one is

2980
02:03:42,239 --> 02:03:44,480
considering a career in it because there

2981
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:45,199
are

2982
02:03:45,199 --> 02:03:47,760
you know it's like precincts without

2983
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:48,880
fire stations

2984
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:50,960
um there's there's absolutely a lot of

2985
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:52,480
work to do so

2986
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:55,119
that plus the cat really they keep me up

2987
02:03:55,119 --> 02:03:57,360
at night

2988
02:03:57,360 --> 02:04:00,799
can't can't help you with the cat but

2989
02:04:01,119 --> 02:04:03,679
carolyn from my perspective and it's

2990
02:04:03,679 --> 02:04:04,800
maybe not

2991
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:08,639
sort of only an infosec thing

2992
02:04:08,639 --> 02:04:11,440
but when i think about my young children

2993
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:13,679
i have two kids below the age of 10 and

2994
02:04:13,679 --> 02:04:14,880
i think about

2995
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:17,360
like their lives and what the big

2996
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:19,679
challenge of their lives is

2997
02:04:19,679 --> 02:04:21,599
i feel like when i was growing up there

2998
02:04:21,599 --> 02:04:24,159
was like an agreed-upon set of facts

2999
02:04:24,159 --> 02:04:26,719
that people believed and i think that's

3000
02:04:26,719 --> 02:04:28,000
not the case today

3001
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:31,440
i think disinformation is rampant

3002
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:34,560
and i think that that is just a

3003
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:37,679
super fascinating phenomenon you know

3004
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:40,239
and i think that

3005
02:04:40,239 --> 02:04:42,400
as security professionals you know

3006
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:46,079
integrity of information has always been

3007
02:04:46,079 --> 02:04:49,440
of utmost importance to us and i think

3008
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:52,480
we have an opportunity um but i

3009
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:53,840
certainly don't know how to go about

3010
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:55,440
solving it which is why it keeps me up

3011
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:57,360
at night that to me is

3012
02:04:57,360 --> 02:05:00,239
absolutely terrifying

3013
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:04,079
yipes jeffrey what keeps you up at night

3014
02:05:04,079 --> 02:05:06,560
uh well i'll pick something different

3015
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:08,239
than what my other colleagues have said

3016
02:05:08,239 --> 02:05:08,960
and i think

3017
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:12,880
uh you know privacy issues i think and

3018
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:15,360
the need for people to better understand

3019
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:16,079
them

3020
02:05:16,079 --> 02:05:18,560
and i think as professionals it's we

3021
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:19,520
really need to help

3022
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:22,480
people people that are not technologists

3023
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:23,199
understand

3024
02:05:23,199 --> 02:05:26,480
why privacy issues are important to them

3025
02:05:26,480 --> 02:05:29,040
i mean when we talk about you can

3026
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:30,639
combine this with getting people

3027
02:05:30,639 --> 02:05:33,199
interested in the field but go to

3028
02:05:33,199 --> 02:05:34,239
schools go

3029
02:05:34,239 --> 02:05:36,719
to as a as a professional in this

3030
02:05:36,719 --> 02:05:37,679
industry

3031
02:05:37,679 --> 02:05:41,280
and uh and speak to them about about

3032
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:43,280
these kinds of issues and kind of will

3033
02:05:43,280 --> 02:05:44,719
touch back on something that

3034
02:05:44,719 --> 02:05:47,199
katie talked about before not not

3035
02:05:47,199 --> 02:05:50,239
speaking early enough in her career

3036
02:05:50,239 --> 02:05:51,840
everyone in this industry no matter what

3037
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:53,280
level you are you're at the level where

3038
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:55,360
you can go into a school and talk to

3039
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:58,239
talk to students about the work you do

3040
02:05:58,239 --> 02:05:58,960
about the

3041
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:01,679
pressing issues of the day and they will

3042
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:02,000
ask

3043
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,400
you they're smart they will ask you very

3044
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:06,320
intelligent questions and very

3045
02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:07,280
challenging

3046
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:09,119
questions but i think you know it's our

3047
02:06:09,119 --> 02:06:10,400
duty to to go

3048
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:13,440
and and and help educate those

3049
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:17,839
those uh those folks

3050
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:21,440
excellent excellent so

3051
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:22,960
we've talked about the nightmares

3052
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:24,639
including the cats um

3053
02:06:24,639 --> 02:06:26,719
where do you see hope for the future

3054
02:06:26,719 --> 02:06:31,840
where do you see things getting better

3055
02:06:42,719 --> 02:06:46,239
i have a couple of kids as well and um

3056
02:06:46,239 --> 02:06:50,239
all of my hope is is wrapped up in them

3057
02:06:50,239 --> 02:06:53,599
and and their generation

3058
02:06:53,599 --> 02:06:57,599
and you know not just what they will do

3059
02:06:57,599 --> 02:06:59,920
but hopefully what they won't do with

3060
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:00,800
technology

3061
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:03,599
quite frankly um you know we are

3062
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:04,960
building things faster than we can

3063
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:07,199
secure them we've always done this

3064
02:07:07,199 --> 02:07:10,159
but at this point it is exceeding you

3065
02:07:10,159 --> 02:07:10,480
know

3066
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:13,599
even our ability to keep up with

3067
02:07:13,599 --> 02:07:15,840
with the needs and of of all of these

3068
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:16,960
threats so

3069
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:20,480
um my hope for the future is is that we

3070
02:07:20,480 --> 02:07:21,440
will

3071
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:24,800
um grow a little wiser you know with uh

3072
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:26,800
our our building of technology just

3073
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:28,159
because we can

3074
02:07:28,159 --> 02:07:30,719
doesn't mean we should necessarily build

3075
02:07:30,719 --> 02:07:31,440
it um

3076
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:34,639
and that we'll um we'll start having

3077
02:07:34,639 --> 02:07:35,199
better

3078
02:07:35,199 --> 02:07:38,079
and more knowledgeable lawmakers and

3079
02:07:38,079 --> 02:07:40,000
regulators who can help

3080
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:43,280
um shape the industry without holding it

3081
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:44,719
back and without

3082
02:07:44,719 --> 02:07:47,280
um you know chilling security research

3083
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:48,719
for example

3084
02:07:48,719 --> 02:07:51,599
in in their willingness to regulate

3085
02:07:51,599 --> 02:07:53,679
these systems

3086
02:07:53,679 --> 02:07:57,040
so anyway i think that there are more

3087
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:59,280
technologists like me and others who are

3088
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:00,960
willing to help with that regulatory

3089
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:02,320
process

3090
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:04,719
and hopefully shape an industry that we

3091
02:08:04,719 --> 02:08:05,679
can all live with

3092
02:08:05,679 --> 02:08:08,560
whether or not uh you know regardless of

3093
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:09,920
how fast computers get

3094
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:12,560
and and how close we are to true ai and

3095
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:13,520
all of that

3096
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:16,800
um i'm i am hopeful

3097
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:19,119
awesome jeffrey i was going to say the

3098
02:08:19,119 --> 02:08:20,800
same thing katie said it's really the

3099
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:21,679
it's the youth

3100
02:08:21,679 --> 02:08:24,719
of today and as they

3101
02:08:24,719 --> 02:08:27,520
those who have grown up with with a much

3102
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:29,280
higher level of technology than any of

3103
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:30,480
us had when we

3104
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:32,560
grow as they get older the average

3105
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:34,639
understanding of technology is going to

3106
02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:36,159
increase you know you have lawmakers

3107
02:08:36,159 --> 02:08:37,679
that are 80 years old

3108
02:08:37,679 --> 02:08:39,679
you know the the technology biggest

3109
02:08:39,679 --> 02:08:41,280
technology when they grew up was a

3110
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:43,280
telephone that was a party line

3111
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:46,000
in their in their house so you know as

3112
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:46,320
as

3113
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:49,440
people as the youth get uh older they

3114
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:51,040
will have a much better understanding

3115
02:08:51,040 --> 02:08:52,159
and i think

3116
02:08:52,159 --> 02:08:54,719
the more that we do to help them not

3117
02:08:54,719 --> 02:08:56,320
just understand the technology but

3118
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:57,119
understand

3119
02:08:57,119 --> 02:08:59,679
the societal issues that that technology

3120
02:08:59,679 --> 02:09:00,639
poses

3121
02:09:00,639 --> 02:09:05,840
um the better we will be in the future

3122
02:09:06,639 --> 02:09:09,599
excellent carolyn

3123
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:15,280
i think that education

3124
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:17,119
is going to be different for my young

3125
02:09:17,119 --> 02:09:20,239
children than it was for me

3126
02:09:20,239 --> 02:09:23,599
my husband and i went through like

3127
02:09:23,599 --> 02:09:26,639
traditional american education which

3128
02:09:26,639 --> 02:09:27,360
really just

3129
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:31,040
means a lot of student loans um

3130
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:35,040
and i think for my kids

3131
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:38,719
like one of there were so many

3132
02:09:38,719 --> 02:09:40,639
amazing things that came out of the

3133
02:09:40,639 --> 02:09:42,239
pandemic and a lot of them had to do

3134
02:09:42,239 --> 02:09:44,320
with technology

3135
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:47,599
my six-year-old is proficient on zoom

3136
02:09:47,599 --> 02:09:49,520
she's more proficient than i am on sam i

3137
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:51,280
i literally look over her shoulder

3138
02:09:51,280 --> 02:09:52,880
and i'm like oh my gosh you can do that

3139
02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:54,800
she's like yeah duh mom

3140
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:59,360
and um she's learning to code

3141
02:09:59,360 --> 02:10:01,920
um i wish i learned to code the way that

3142
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:03,199
she's learning to code because it's

3143
02:10:03,199 --> 02:10:05,919
actually fun

3144
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,719
you can take in today's world which i

3145
02:10:10,719 --> 02:10:11,520
think you

3146
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:15,360
couldn't 20 years ago the very best

3147
02:10:15,360 --> 02:10:18,400
most engaging most interesting teacher

3148
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:21,840
and that teacher can teach everyone

3149
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:24,159
about a topic in the entire world who

3150
02:10:24,159 --> 02:10:25,599
has internet now

3151
02:10:25,599 --> 02:10:28,400
only half the world has internet it's

3152
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:29,199
easy to

3153
02:10:29,199 --> 02:10:30,880
think because of the situation where and

3154
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:32,159
then everyone has internet not everyone

3155
02:10:32,159 --> 02:10:34,719
has internet that is a separate problem

3156
02:10:34,719 --> 02:10:38,000
um but i do think that

3157
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:41,679
education is gonna change for the better

3158
02:10:41,679 --> 02:10:42,960
i think that there's going to be more

3159
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:45,360
focus on

3160
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:46,880
things that people want to learn and

3161
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:48,639
things that people need to learn and i

3162
02:10:48,639 --> 02:10:49,840
think that

3163
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:51,840
people are going to have more and more

3164
02:10:51,840 --> 02:10:53,280
access

3165
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:57,199
to learning if if they choose it

3166
02:10:57,199 --> 02:11:00,639
excellent is there any any hopes any

3167
02:11:00,639 --> 02:11:03,679
bright lights that you see yeah just to

3168
02:11:03,679 --> 02:11:05,760
add what carolyn said i mean covets

3169
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:07,599
changed a lot of things right i mean

3170
02:11:07,599 --> 02:11:08,079
code

3171
02:11:08,079 --> 02:11:11,679
uh kobe drove a lot of innovation um

3172
02:11:11,679 --> 02:11:13,599
which is sometimes scary especially the

3173
02:11:13,599 --> 02:11:16,159
areas that i support there's like wow

3174
02:11:16,159 --> 02:11:19,679
um and so but i think it's it's

3175
02:11:19,679 --> 02:11:21,520
hopefully it's gonna also drive the

3176
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:22,719
accessibility

3177
02:11:22,719 --> 02:11:24,560
right that people have more access to

3178
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:26,239
things that they didn't have

3179
02:11:26,239 --> 02:11:29,520
i think you know the uh security talent

3180
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:30,800
pool is going to be wired and

3181
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:31,840
you know we don't have those

3182
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:33,760
restrictions of oh you have to be in the

3183
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:35,440
bay area you have to be in there you

3184
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:36,639
know boston to

3185
02:11:36,639 --> 02:11:38,159
apply for this job so i think we're

3186
02:11:38,159 --> 02:11:39,920
going to have much more

3187
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:42,560
um larger talent people being more open

3188
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:43,920
about remote work so those are the

3189
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:45,520
things excites me

3190
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:49,520
um and and yeah the the youth

3191
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:53,840
i mean my 7 year old she she's awesome

3192
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:55,119
right and i was like oh where's this

3193
02:11:55,119 --> 02:11:57,440
button um but

3194
02:11:57,440 --> 02:12:00,239
yeah i'm just excited to see things

3195
02:12:00,239 --> 02:12:00,800
through her

3196
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:04,079
eyes um and

3197
02:12:04,079 --> 02:12:06,719
yeah i'm hopeful for for the younger

3198
02:12:06,719 --> 02:12:07,920
generation i mean

3199
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:09,440
you know i've seen this with all the

3200
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:11,040
stuff happening around us

3201
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:12,560
you know how high school students in

3202
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:14,880
middle school students here in the area

3203
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:15,840
are speaking up

3204
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:17,599
and you know how they're showing their

3205
02:12:17,599 --> 02:12:18,880
empathy much

3206
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:22,400
more than a lot of adults in most cases

3207
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:22,719
so

3208
02:12:22,719 --> 02:12:24,400
i'm really really helpful about the

3209
02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:26,239
youth that you know they will

3210
02:12:26,239 --> 02:12:28,239
they will make the changes that we all

3211
02:12:28,239 --> 02:12:30,079
need excellent

3212
02:12:30,079 --> 02:12:32,159
we've got two minutes left i had one

3213
02:12:32,159 --> 02:12:35,040
last question see if we can sneak it in

3214
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:37,199
we've we've gone through careers and and

3215
02:12:37,199 --> 02:12:38,079
twists and

3216
02:12:38,079 --> 02:12:40,560
and and hope for the future what is the

3217
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:42,000
one bit of advice you would give your

3218
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,159
younger self at this point

3219
02:12:44,159 --> 02:12:45,360
that you as you were starting your

3220
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:46,719
career what would you what would you say

3221
02:12:46,719 --> 02:12:49,840
to yourself

3222
02:12:51,119 --> 02:12:54,480
i would say that um like all sorts of

3223
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:55,840
stuff is gonna happen

3224
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:57,840
that you can't predict and that you

3225
02:12:57,840 --> 02:12:59,760
won't expect and some of it will be

3226
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:01,599
amazing and some of it will be not

3227
02:13:01,599 --> 02:13:02,480
amazing

3228
02:13:02,480 --> 02:13:05,520
and i would say that um

3229
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:08,560
like to to trust yourself to know

3230
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:10,880
that whatever happens you will be there

3231
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:12,560
on the other side to catch yourself to

3232
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:14,560
know that you are so capable

3233
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:16,800
that no matter what comes up you can

3234
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:18,560
handle it that

3235
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:21,599
would have been so nice to know as a

3236
02:13:21,599 --> 02:13:24,320
younger person

3237
02:13:25,840 --> 02:13:30,480
don't be afraid to say i don't know

3238
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:33,920
ask for help um no one can know

3239
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:35,360
everything

3240
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:37,840
uh and i think people sometimes they

3241
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:39,520
they think people will think that

3242
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:40,639
they're weak

3243
02:13:40,639 --> 02:13:42,159
if they do that and that that's not the

3244
02:13:42,159 --> 02:13:44,400
case if i see people say i don't know

3245
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:47,519
that's actually a positive

3246
02:13:52,239 --> 02:13:55,040
i think a couple things one i would have

3247
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:57,760
told my younger self to start a company

3248
02:13:57,760 --> 02:13:59,840
the fact that i waited until i was in my

3249
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:01,840
40s to start a company made me realize i

3250
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:03,599
should have started a company in my 20s

3251
02:14:03,599 --> 02:14:04,320
so

3252
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:07,679
start a company and then

3253
02:14:07,679 --> 02:14:10,400
you know when i wasn't being paid enough

3254
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:12,000
and i wasn't being promoted and i wasn't

3255
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,280
being recognized

3256
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:16,000
i wish i had told myself um in more

3257
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,079
emphatic terms to take that job and

3258
02:14:18,079 --> 02:14:19,119
shove it you know

3259
02:14:19,119 --> 02:14:21,760
so that that's the advice i would give

3260
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:22,639
my younger self

3261
02:14:22,639 --> 02:14:25,199
start a company a lot sooner and if

3262
02:14:25,199 --> 02:14:26,159
you're not in a position

3263
02:14:26,159 --> 02:14:29,760
to do so um you know then

3264
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:32,880
make sure that you are serving cert

3265
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:35,360
your loyalty should be to yourself not

3266
02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:36,880
to any particular job

3267
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:40,079
or team or whatnot career-wise your

3268
02:14:40,079 --> 02:14:41,360
loyalty really

3269
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:44,719
has to be to yourself and you will build

3270
02:14:44,719 --> 02:14:48,079
uh great things wherever you are and um

3271
02:14:48,079 --> 02:14:50,480
anyone is lucky to have you so i wish i

3272
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:52,840
wish my younger self had heard those

3273
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:55,840
words

3274
02:14:57,920 --> 02:14:59,920
to me i guess one thing i would say

3275
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:01,360
don't be afraid of um

3276
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:03,599

3279
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:09,440
you know sometimes you feel like oh my

3280
02:15:09,440 --> 02:15:11,520

3281

3368
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:34,800
hello everyone this is

3369
02:29:34,800 --> 02:29:37,920
henrik adrian from the first team member

3370
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:41,120
luck laser and i will be moderating this

3371
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:43,359
session and the next sessions today

3372
02:29:43,359 --> 02:29:45,120
we are now in the second half of the

3373
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:47,920
first con 2021 day two in the session

3374
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:49,120
one breakout

3375
02:29:49,120 --> 02:29:52,080
one stream just one thing before we get

3376
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:53,120
started as per

3377
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:55,600
trusty has just said that we will be

3378
02:29:55,600 --> 02:29:56,800
holding q a

3379
02:29:56,800 --> 02:29:59,200
immediately following this presentation

3380
02:29:59,200 --> 02:29:59,920
in the work

3381
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:03,200
adventure platform is the 2d virtual

3382
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:04,000
cool social

3383
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:05,920
platforms which is the same place where

3384
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:07,760
you can find our exhibitors

3385
02:30:07,760 --> 02:30:10,399
and other fun activities like q and a

3386
02:30:10,399 --> 02:30:12,720
networking hall and ctf events you're

3387
02:30:12,720 --> 02:30:14,000
gonna like it

3388
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:15,760
you can join these events after logging

3389
02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:17,120
into the work adventure with the

3390
02:30:17,120 --> 02:30:19,120
registration credentials provided

3391
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:22,080
to you and send by the email after you

3392
02:30:22,080 --> 02:30:22,560
complete

3393
02:30:22,560 --> 02:30:24,960
the registration or ask for advice send

3394
02:30:24,960 --> 02:30:27,040
the email to the events

3395
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:29,840
at the first.org for the quick

3396
02:30:29,840 --> 02:30:31,040
registration for it

3397
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:34,479
so the next session is uh allow me to

3398
02:30:34,479 --> 02:30:35,280
introduce the

3399
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:39,280
talk of the breaking the chain of trust

3400
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:41,760
so this technical talk describes the

3401
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:42,319
threats

3402
02:30:42,319 --> 02:30:45,120
in the secure boot process on computer

3403
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:46,319
environments with the

3404
02:30:46,319 --> 02:30:48,560
concept of the breaking the chain of

3405
02:30:48,560 --> 02:30:50,479
trust by skipping cryptographic

3406
02:30:50,479 --> 02:30:51,600
signature checks

3407
02:30:51,600 --> 02:30:53,760
in their implementation of the roots of

3408
02:30:53,760 --> 02:30:55,040
trust

3409
02:30:55,040 --> 02:30:58,000
so this talk is important to us since

3410
02:30:58,000 --> 02:30:59,280
there has been a grub

3411
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:01,920
or boot hall vulnerability disclosed by

3412
02:31:01,920 --> 02:31:03,920
eclipse in the 2020

3413
02:31:03,920 --> 02:31:06,800
so let's welcome the speakers mr alex

3414
02:31:06,800 --> 02:31:08,080
bazanyuk

3415
02:31:08,080 --> 02:31:10,319
uh the firmware expert from the intel

3416
02:31:10,319 --> 02:31:11,359
corporations

3417
02:31:11,359 --> 02:31:14,560
uh i hope he's uh here right now yeah

3418
02:31:14,560 --> 02:31:15,439
okay good

3419
02:31:15,439 --> 02:31:17,920
cool and mr jc michael from the

3420
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:19,760
equipment also the follower with the

3421
02:31:19,760 --> 02:31:22,640
research on exploits inside processor

3422
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:25,200
especially for the hardware design right

3423
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:27,280
are you here right now too

3424
02:31:27,280 --> 02:31:29,920
okay good call anna mistress mike is cut

3425
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:31,840
off from the ecliption also the

3426
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:32,399
following

3427
02:31:32,399 --> 02:31:33,960
research in bios firmware

3428
02:31:33,960 --> 02:31:35,520
implementations

3429
02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:39,040
so uh and with that let's get started

3430
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:42,000
alex jc and mikey the follower is all

3431
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:43,359
yours

3432
02:31:43,359 --> 02:31:45,680
thank you thank you everyone um we're

3433
02:31:45,680 --> 02:31:47,520
glad to present here in first

3434
02:31:47,520 --> 02:31:52,319
um so today um let me share my slides

3435
02:31:52,319 --> 02:31:55,520
uh very quickly

3436
02:31:55,520 --> 02:31:57,120
can you see it can you tell me that you

3437
02:31:57,120 --> 02:31:59,600
see my slides

3438
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:02,720
yes we can see your slides so yeah um

3439
02:32:02,720 --> 02:32:04,000
today we will talk about

3440
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,399
the hardware and from and the former

3441
02:32:06,399 --> 02:32:07,439
vulnerabilities

3442
02:32:07,439 --> 02:32:09,359
and how this affects in the entire trust

3443
02:32:09,359 --> 02:32:10,720
of the device

3444
02:32:10,720 --> 02:32:13,840
and what we can do to run incident

3445
02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:14,560
response

3446
02:32:14,560 --> 02:32:17,760
and forensic on the devices it's not

3447
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:19,600
super technical talk but it will be some

3448
02:32:19,600 --> 02:32:21,520
technical details some of the slides

3449
02:32:21,520 --> 02:32:23,439
will be overview

3450
02:32:23,439 --> 02:32:26,479
you can check other sources

3451
02:32:26,479 --> 02:32:29,120
from mick and jesse and myself about the

3452
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:31,200
more deeper research we provide over the

3453
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:32,080
years

3454
02:32:32,080 --> 02:32:34,720
about some exploitation techniques and

3455
02:32:34,720 --> 02:32:36,240
different presentations in our past

3456
02:32:36,240 --> 02:32:37,280
conferences

3457
02:32:37,280 --> 02:32:40,720
of the different aspects of that and uh

3458
02:32:40,720 --> 02:32:42,240
in the end or close to the end we will

3459
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:44,000
discuss a specific vulnerability and

3460
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:45,600
specific uh

3461
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:48,640
components uh in the boot flow

3462
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:50,840
and what is the implication to have a

3463
02:32:50,840 --> 02:32:53,359
vulnerabilities and that component

3464
02:32:53,359 --> 02:32:55,760
how that could be used by the attacker

3465
02:32:55,760 --> 02:32:57,680
to compromise the entire integrity of

3466
02:32:57,680 --> 02:32:58,399
the device

3467
02:32:58,399 --> 02:33:02,080
and in fact device as the as the legacy

3468
02:33:02,080 --> 02:33:05,600
rootkits was infection in mbr and vbr

3469
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:09,520
previously so um just uh

3470
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:11,439
30 seconds i'm sitting on co-founder of

3471
02:33:11,439 --> 02:33:12,640
eclipse um

3472
02:33:12,640 --> 02:33:14,479
and previously was researchers with

3473
02:33:14,479 --> 02:33:16,399
mickey and jesse we did a lot of

3474
02:33:16,399 --> 02:33:17,200
research

3475
02:33:17,200 --> 02:33:19,040
in a different area again just

3476
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:20,399
referencing our

3477
02:33:20,399 --> 02:33:23,120
back twitter and github and other links

3478
02:33:23,120 --> 02:33:24,399
about us

3479
02:33:24,399 --> 02:33:26,240
so uh when we're talking about the

3480
02:33:26,240 --> 02:33:28,560
devices usually people believe that this

3481
02:33:28,560 --> 02:33:31,359
is monolithic uh trusted blocks

3482
02:33:31,359 --> 02:33:34,160
and has the best security practice

3483
02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:35,200
possibly have

3484
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:38,240
um as well as we have

3485
02:33:38,240 --> 02:33:40,560
in this in a software world like all of

3486
02:33:40,560 --> 02:33:41,680
these devops

3487
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:45,280
the most kind of advanced techniques cfi

3488
02:33:45,280 --> 02:33:48,560
and all of this kind of stuff but in

3489
02:33:48,560 --> 02:33:50,880
reality the hardware is not monolithic

3490
02:33:50,880 --> 02:33:53,439
can like like typical laptop a server

3491
02:33:53,439 --> 02:33:54,000
contains

3492
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,479
many components designed and implemented

3493
02:33:56,479 --> 02:33:58,319
from the different oem on a different

3494
02:33:58,319 --> 02:33:58,960
time

3495
02:33:58,960 --> 02:34:01,439
time slot and they was basically

3496
02:34:01,439 --> 02:34:02,080
integrated

3497
02:34:02,080 --> 02:34:04,880
all together to have a final device and

3498
02:34:04,880 --> 02:34:06,640
it's very complicated and

3499
02:34:06,640 --> 02:34:09,120
many of the components has the software

3500
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:10,560
running on that components called

3501
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:11,280
frommer

3502
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:13,120
for example network card has its own

3503
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:14,319
from

3504
02:34:14,319 --> 02:34:16,319
ufi it's a separate firmware system

3505
02:34:16,319 --> 02:34:18,640
firmware then it could be intel me

3506
02:34:18,640 --> 02:34:19,439
firmware

3507
02:34:19,439 --> 02:34:22,000
it could be wi-fi confirm and so on and

3508
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:23,680
all of this complexity

3509
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:26,560
create the the big attack surface which

3510
02:34:26,560 --> 02:34:26,880
is

3511
02:34:26,880 --> 02:34:29,359
researchers and attackers both looking

3512
02:34:29,359 --> 02:34:30,240
in

3513
02:34:30,240 --> 02:34:32,800
to find the interesting interesting

3514
02:34:32,800 --> 02:34:35,120
weaknesses and vulnerabilities

3515
02:34:35,120 --> 02:34:37,520
um so and they going from all of that

3516
02:34:37,520 --> 02:34:40,240
components and looking very deeply

3517
02:34:40,240 --> 02:34:41,920
from their different perspective and

3518
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:44,080
servers and um

3519
02:34:44,080 --> 02:34:46,640
and and laptops and when we're talking

3520
02:34:46,640 --> 02:34:48,399
about even appliances

3521
02:34:48,399 --> 02:34:51,439
in most appliances it's just and neither

3522
02:34:51,439 --> 02:34:52,160
arm or

3523
02:34:52,160 --> 02:34:55,280
maps or x86 box which has

3524
02:34:55,280 --> 02:34:58,399
um the same complexity as the server and

3525
02:34:58,399 --> 02:35:01,280
may have a remote interfaces like bmc

3526
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:03,600
or may have a remote interfaces like web

3527
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:05,359
interfaces things like that

3528
02:35:05,359 --> 02:35:08,080
and it's all kind of uh has its own

3529
02:35:08,080 --> 02:35:10,720
update processes and their own kind of

3530
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:13,520
supply chain and security practices

3531
02:35:13,520 --> 02:35:15,840
which has a lot of weaknesses and

3532
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:17,600
you can see on the screen i will not go

3533
02:35:17,600 --> 02:35:19,840
one by one but when you see the red

3534
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:21,760
boxes it basically was exploited in the

3535
02:35:21,760 --> 02:35:22,640
wild

3536
02:35:22,640 --> 02:35:24,319
and then you can see like usb was

3537
02:35:24,319 --> 02:35:27,200
exploited in while the efi

3538
02:35:27,200 --> 02:35:30,560
bmc was exploited in the wild intel

3539
02:35:30,560 --> 02:35:32,880
me imt was exploited in the wild by

3540
02:35:32,880 --> 02:35:34,000
platinum group

3541
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:35,680
and then the rest components even if

3542
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:37,600
they was not exploited in the wild

3543
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:39,760
there was a significant risk which was

3544
02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:40,800
introduced

3545
02:35:40,800 --> 02:35:43,359
from raw hammer to roca to spectrum

3546
02:35:43,359 --> 02:35:44,160
meltdown

3547
02:35:44,160 --> 02:35:46,399
which is basically breaking security of

3548
02:35:46,399 --> 02:35:48,880
entire device

3549
02:35:48,880 --> 02:35:50,880
and then when we're talking about each

3550
02:35:50,880 --> 02:35:52,840
component and the system overall in

3551
02:35:52,840 --> 02:35:54,160
general

3552
02:35:54,160 --> 02:35:57,280
there is two things which is uh

3553
02:35:57,280 --> 02:35:59,920
need to take care for sure is basically

3554
02:35:59,920 --> 02:36:02,560
secure update and secure boot

3555
02:36:02,560 --> 02:36:04,720
secure update is meaning that we can

3556
02:36:04,720 --> 02:36:06,840
update that component from a very

3557
02:36:06,840 --> 02:36:09,359
securely

3558
02:36:09,359 --> 02:36:11,600
this republic cryptography signature

3559
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:13,439
when it could not be spoofed in the

3560
02:36:13,439 --> 02:36:14,319
middle

3561
02:36:14,319 --> 02:36:17,600
by the attacker secret boot meaning that

3562
02:36:17,600 --> 02:36:20,319
uh the software running on a late stage

3563
02:36:20,319 --> 02:36:22,319
will be verified by the

3564
02:36:22,319 --> 02:36:24,880
software from a running early stage so

3565
02:36:24,880 --> 02:36:25,760
then we know

3566
02:36:25,760 --> 02:36:28,960
that if you have some secret

3567
02:36:28,960 --> 02:36:32,960
or some kind of very very trusted

3568
02:36:32,960 --> 02:36:35,359
initialization phase the rest of the

3569
02:36:35,359 --> 02:36:37,120
faces would be verified

3570
02:36:37,120 --> 02:36:39,040
and this very trusted initialization

3571
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:41,439
phases in a recent five years

3572
02:36:41,439 --> 02:36:43,760
got huge traction on the harder route of

3573
02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:44,479
trust

3574
02:36:44,479 --> 02:36:46,240
is basically all of the different

3575
02:36:46,240 --> 02:36:48,319
technology which is implemented in this

3576
02:36:48,319 --> 02:36:48,960
first

3577
02:36:48,960 --> 02:36:52,319
phase which will run verification

3578
02:36:52,319 --> 02:36:54,960
of the of the next phase which will be

3579
02:36:54,960 --> 02:36:56,560
responsible to the verification on the

3580
02:36:56,560 --> 02:36:58,160
rest of the system

3581
02:36:58,160 --> 02:37:00,479
and there's a lot of development happen

3582
02:37:00,479 --> 02:37:02,880
from the multiple vendors

3583
02:37:02,880 --> 02:37:05,439
from vendors like desktop vendors and

3584
02:37:05,439 --> 02:37:07,280
laptop vendors like hp

3585
02:37:07,280 --> 02:37:10,479
to their cloud providers like uh

3586
02:37:10,479 --> 02:37:14,160
um nitra amazon nitra and then

3587
02:37:14,160 --> 02:37:16,000
titan and open titan for the google

3588
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:17,840
cloud so there's a lot of good

3589
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:18,960
activities happens

3590
02:37:18,960 --> 02:37:21,600
on the uh on the first initialization

3591
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:23,200
phase

3592
02:37:23,200 --> 02:37:25,520
and then if we will uh jump from the

3593
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:27,280
theory to a little bit more practical

3594
02:37:27,280 --> 02:37:28,319
aspects on the

3595
02:37:28,319 --> 02:37:31,200
real attacks then there is was a lot of

3596
02:37:31,200 --> 02:37:32,319
attacks in the wild

3597
02:37:32,319 --> 02:37:35,760
targeting boots boot sequence

3598
02:37:35,760 --> 02:37:37,920
in order to inject code at different

3599
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:39,040
point on the time

3600
02:37:39,040 --> 02:37:40,560
sometimes it could be during the

3601
02:37:40,560 --> 02:37:42,800
operation system but in many cases it

3602
02:37:42,800 --> 02:37:43,920
will go

3603
02:37:43,920 --> 02:37:46,960
before the operation system in order to

3604
02:37:46,960 --> 02:37:48,479
disable certain controls in the

3605
02:37:48,479 --> 02:37:50,479
operation system level in order to take

3606
02:37:50,479 --> 02:37:51,840
a more persistency

3607
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:54,160
almost stealth functionality or more

3608
02:37:54,160 --> 02:37:55,840
disruption capabilities like patent

3609
02:37:55,840 --> 02:37:56,960
non-pc attacks

3610
02:37:56,960 --> 02:37:59,439
which was targeting mbr so we basically

3611
02:37:59,439 --> 02:38:00,319
see the

3612
02:38:00,319 --> 02:38:02,479
that uh antarcticus is not looking only

3613
02:38:02,479 --> 02:38:03,359
from the

3614
02:38:03,359 --> 02:38:06,960
uh poor um uh poor uh post-expansion

3615
02:38:06,960 --> 02:38:08,000
phases

3616
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,399
um um post-infection phases when they

3617
02:38:10,399 --> 02:38:12,319
basically could accelerate secrets

3618
02:38:12,319 --> 02:38:13,680
and things like that but they're looking

3619
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:16,160
also how to stay longer how to be

3620
02:38:16,160 --> 02:38:17,040
undetected

3621
02:38:17,040 --> 02:38:18,800
how to take full control and make system

3622
02:38:18,800 --> 02:38:21,280
unbootable and this is all where the

3623
02:38:21,280 --> 02:38:23,760
frommer is playing a big role and in

3624
02:38:23,760 --> 02:38:26,000
this firma space the bootloaders

3625
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,880
also play a very significant lower role

3626
02:38:28,880 --> 02:38:30,960
because they're sitting right before

3627
02:38:30,960 --> 02:38:33,920
um right before the operation system uh

3628
02:38:33,920 --> 02:38:34,319
but

3629
02:38:34,319 --> 02:38:37,280
uh after firmware so it's basically um

3630
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:39,200
intermedium between

3631
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:41,359
firmware and the classical operation

3632
02:38:41,359 --> 02:38:42,399
system software

3633
02:38:42,399 --> 02:38:44,479
which was very juicy for the attackers

3634
02:38:44,479 --> 02:38:46,399
um there's a links

3635
02:38:46,399 --> 02:38:49,680
to check offline and then uh

3636
02:38:49,680 --> 02:38:52,000
as the response uh to this previous

3637
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,240
attack on the bootloaders

3638
02:38:54,240 --> 02:38:56,399
uh the classical mbr vbr type of

3639
02:38:56,399 --> 02:38:57,439
bootloaders

3640
02:38:57,439 --> 02:38:59,520
uh secure boot technology was invented

3641
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:01,120
and was highly pushed

3642
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:03,200
we will talk today uh really about ufi

3643
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:04,479
secure boot

3644
02:39:04,479 --> 02:39:05,520
there could be a different

3645
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:07,280
implementation and there could be

3646
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:09,120
different type of rules how to implement

3647
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:10,000
secure boot we

3648
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,560
specifically focus today on the ufi but

3649
02:39:12,560 --> 02:39:14,640
there is more references could be

3650
02:39:14,640 --> 02:39:16,319
found on the other implementation as

3651
02:39:16,319 --> 02:39:17,840
well um

3652
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:20,160
so the way uh how the secure boot works

3653
02:39:20,160 --> 02:39:21,120
is basically

3654
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:22,960
has certain keys and at some point it's

3655
02:39:22,960 --> 02:39:24,640
not very fine binaries

3656
02:39:24,640 --> 02:39:26,479
in order to make sure that all of the

3657
02:39:26,479 --> 02:39:29,439
binaries has this uh

3658
02:39:29,439 --> 02:39:32,000
checked by signature so then we can

3659
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:33,840
basically trust this binary and binary

3660
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:35,359
wouldn't be running

3661
02:39:35,359 --> 02:39:39,359
if the if it's not verified and then uh

3662
02:39:39,359 --> 02:39:41,439
ufi secure boot create like hierarchical

3663
02:39:41,439 --> 02:39:44,160
keys uh or hierarchical kind of

3664
02:39:44,160 --> 02:39:47,359
databases when you can store

3665
02:39:47,359 --> 02:39:49,439
what kind of binaries is allowed and

3666
02:39:49,439 --> 02:39:51,840
what kind of binaries is

3667
02:39:51,840 --> 02:39:54,800
and when you have basically a master key

3668
02:39:54,800 --> 02:39:56,080
which will verify

3669
02:39:56,080 --> 02:39:57,600
it's called the platform here which will

3670
02:39:57,600 --> 02:39:59,280
verify key exchange key which will

3671
02:39:59,280 --> 02:39:59,920
verify

3672
02:39:59,920 --> 02:40:03,760
db and dbx databases um in a way

3673
02:40:03,760 --> 02:40:07,760
in in in the ufi secure boot we have

3674
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:09,680
uh all of this key stored in the same

3675
02:40:09,680 --> 02:40:11,520
storage as the system from

3676
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:13,680
it's called spi storage so if someone

3677
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:15,359
compromised that spi storage they can

3678
02:40:15,359 --> 02:40:17,279
manipulate all of this data

3679
02:40:17,279 --> 02:40:19,120
referring our previous work we've done

3680
02:40:19,120 --> 02:40:21,359
to show this kind of attacks

3681
02:40:21,359 --> 02:40:24,160
um so when we when all this key working

3682
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:25,520
great and the

3683
02:40:25,520 --> 02:40:28,240
firmware has fully fully configured

3684
02:40:28,240 --> 02:40:28,880
correctly

3685
02:40:28,880 --> 02:40:31,439
no vulnerabilities in any of the

3686
02:40:31,439 --> 02:40:33,760
implementation pieces

3687
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:36,720
on early stage all of the control move

3688
02:40:36,720 --> 02:40:37,359
into the

3689
02:40:37,359 --> 02:40:40,319
bootloaders and bootloaders basically

3690
02:40:40,319 --> 02:40:41,840
need to enable

3691
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:45,760
end windows and linux boot flow in that

3692
02:40:45,760 --> 02:40:46,640
case

3693
02:40:46,640 --> 02:40:48,640
there is uh in case of windows it would

3694
02:40:48,640 --> 02:40:51,040
be a microsoft signup bootloaders

3695
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:53,120
which will uh call then late stage of

3696
02:40:53,120 --> 02:40:55,279
the microsoft os

3697
02:40:55,279 --> 02:40:57,760
to run late stage boot and then in case

3698
02:40:57,760 --> 02:40:58,720
of linux

3699
02:40:58,720 --> 02:41:00,000
then there is something which is called

3700
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
shim which is basically signed by

3701
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,399
microsoft and small binary which should

3702
02:41:04,399 --> 02:41:06,319
transition execution to grub so it

3703
02:41:06,319 --> 02:41:07,200
basically

3704
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:10,399
old job for stream is basically find the

3705
02:41:10,399 --> 02:41:12,479
and verify necessary graph

3706
02:41:12,479 --> 02:41:15,520
and um shim is signed by microsoft but

3707
02:41:15,520 --> 02:41:17,120
grub could be signed by the linux

3708
02:41:17,120 --> 02:41:19,439
distros so this is how the way linux

3709
02:41:19,439 --> 02:41:20,240
enable

3710
02:41:20,240 --> 02:41:23,040
all of that boot flow on the on on the

3711
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:25,760
boxes with the microsoft secure boot

3712
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:27,760
and ufi secure boot practices and how

3713
02:41:27,760 --> 02:41:29,520
they they release uh

3714
02:41:29,520 --> 02:41:32,800
the sign-in keys and all of that so

3715
02:41:32,800 --> 02:41:36,000
all of this kind of looks good and

3716
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:39,279
basically what happens is here and then

3717
02:41:39,279 --> 02:41:42,160
you will check the signature of the from

3718
02:41:42,160 --> 02:41:44,080
the dbx uh

3719
02:41:44,080 --> 02:41:47,120
microsoft microsoft ca um

3720
02:41:47,120 --> 02:41:49,680
cyanide binary uh which would be stream

3721
02:41:49,680 --> 02:41:51,439
and then you will move to the grub

3722
02:41:51,439 --> 02:41:53,920
the interesting piece here that when we

3723
02:41:53,920 --> 02:41:56,399
have a loud database meaning that all of

3724
02:41:56,399 --> 02:41:58,000
that binaries from allow database

3725
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
could run in so if someone replaces one

3726
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:01,760
legitimate shim with another legitimate

3727
02:42:01,760 --> 02:42:02,240
stream

3728
02:42:02,240 --> 02:42:04,080
it still will run if someone replaces

3729
02:42:04,080 --> 02:42:05,439
one legitimate grappler is another

3730
02:42:05,439 --> 02:42:06,080
legitimate

3731
02:42:06,080 --> 02:42:08,160
legitimate graph it will run so it

3732
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:09,359
doesn't really have

3733
02:42:09,359 --> 02:42:12,880
a very kind of thai flow that

3734
02:42:12,880 --> 02:42:14,960
that this binary should only be running

3735
02:42:14,960 --> 02:42:17,040
on this platform with that binary

3736
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:18,800
so it's all exchangeable and that was

3737
02:42:18,800 --> 02:42:21,120
also would be a source of

3738
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:23,120
their weaknesses as well when we will

3739
02:42:23,120 --> 02:42:25,279
move in a second on the

3740
02:42:25,279 --> 02:42:28,560
problems which could be done on this

3741
02:42:28,560 --> 02:42:31,760
specific uh flow

3742
02:42:31,760 --> 02:42:34,160
so then another picture to see how the

3743
02:42:34,160 --> 02:42:35,920
trust is implemented so

3744
02:42:35,920 --> 02:42:37,840
you you may have hardware to start here

3745
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:39,760
you may you may have signed an

3746
02:42:39,760 --> 02:42:42,960
update here you may have a

3747
02:42:42,960 --> 02:42:44,319
full secure boot enabled with

3748
02:42:44,319 --> 02:42:46,720
verification of dixie components

3749
02:42:46,720 --> 02:42:50,000
ufi applications bootloaders bootloaders

3750
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:51,040
is just one

3751
02:42:51,040 --> 02:42:53,439
of the one of the type of the ufi

3752
02:42:53,439 --> 02:42:54,399
application

3753
02:42:54,399 --> 02:42:58,000
and overall ufi environment is very um

3754
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:01,040
very extensible and very um

3755
02:43:01,040 --> 02:43:02,960
complex and juicy for the attacker as

3756
02:43:02,960 --> 02:43:04,240
well as very good

3757
02:43:04,240 --> 02:43:06,880
for developers to build um different use

3758
02:43:06,880 --> 02:43:08,640
cases there is like

3759
02:43:08,640 --> 02:43:11,600
a full wi-fi stack could be running on a

3760
02:43:11,600 --> 02:43:13,680
on ufi environment full bluetooth stack

3761
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:15,439
would be running on a ufo environment

3762
02:43:15,439 --> 02:43:18,880
tcp ip ipv6 ipsec and many other

3763
02:43:18,880 --> 02:43:21,359
interesting application could be

3764
02:43:21,359 --> 02:43:22,720
implemented

3765
02:43:22,720 --> 02:43:24,479
during early stage on the boot before

3766
02:43:24,479 --> 02:43:26,479
even operation system run

3767
02:43:26,479 --> 02:43:30,080
but coming back to our uh our scenarios

3768
02:43:30,080 --> 02:43:32,880
so um these scenarios basically if you

3769
02:43:32,880 --> 02:43:34,319
see a lot of green here

3770
02:43:34,319 --> 02:43:36,800
that green meaning that things should be

3771
02:43:36,800 --> 02:43:38,080
all uh

3772
02:43:38,080 --> 02:43:40,319
great together so if something breaks

3773
02:43:40,319 --> 02:43:42,160
here it will break entire

3774
02:43:42,160 --> 02:43:44,960
uh trust on the device and after that

3775
02:43:44,960 --> 02:43:46,479
nothing could be trusted

3776
02:43:46,479 --> 02:43:49,760
and then at each point on the time the

3777
02:43:49,760 --> 02:43:52,399
before break happens you kind of can

3778
02:43:52,399 --> 02:43:53,040
trust

3779
02:43:53,040 --> 02:43:54,960
what happened before but after it

3780
02:43:54,960 --> 02:43:57,040
happens nothing trusted

3781
02:43:57,040 --> 02:43:59,840
and that's basically saying that it has

3782
02:43:59,840 --> 02:44:01,520
a single point of failure so

3783
02:44:01,520 --> 02:44:03,200
if there would be one witnesses found

3784
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:05,200
here then we have implications for the

3785
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:05,760
entire

3786
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:08,479
integrity on the box so the the root

3787
02:44:08,479 --> 02:44:10,319
kits or boot kits could use it

3788
02:44:10,319 --> 02:44:12,880
uh to inject itself during the boot the

3789
02:44:12,880 --> 02:44:14,960
the boot chain

3790
02:44:14,960 --> 02:44:17,680
uh so uh just couple references on the

3791
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:19,200
harder route of trust

3792
02:44:19,200 --> 02:44:22,080
uh amazing work done by hp surestart and

3793
02:44:22,080 --> 02:44:24,640
google titan chip and apple t2

3794
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:26,399
interesting that they all have a very

3795
02:44:26,399 --> 02:44:28,240
specific implementation very

3796
02:44:28,240 --> 02:44:30,720
vendor-specific implementation which is

3797
02:44:30,720 --> 02:44:32,560
very hard to verify and understand how

3798
02:44:32,560 --> 02:44:33,680
does it work

3799
02:44:33,680 --> 02:44:35,920
so you basically need to trust it so

3800
02:44:35,920 --> 02:44:37,359
when we're talking about hardware to

3801
02:44:37,359 --> 02:44:38,000
stress

3802
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,240
maybe open titan has much more to

3803
02:44:40,240 --> 02:44:42,080
understand how does it work

3804
02:44:42,080 --> 02:44:43,840
but like if you're talking about apple

3805
02:44:43,840 --> 02:44:46,080
t2 and hp sure start

3806
02:44:46,080 --> 02:44:48,720
and even intel boot guard a lot of

3807
02:44:48,720 --> 02:44:50,160
assumptions need to be done

3808
02:44:50,160 --> 02:44:53,279
by trusting certain manufacturer on

3809
02:44:53,279 --> 02:44:54,800
certain architecture with certain

3810
02:44:54,800 --> 02:44:56,479
decisions they make

3811
02:44:56,479 --> 02:45:00,000
on the device to have a full

3812
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:01,520
trust on that device when we're talking

3813
02:45:01,520 --> 02:45:03,760
about supply chain

3814
02:45:03,760 --> 02:45:06,960
until the operation phase so

3815
02:45:06,960 --> 02:45:11,120
uh the previous work uh in this area was

3816
02:45:11,120 --> 02:45:13,120
very significant and important and

3817
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:14,720
demonstrate a lot of

3818
02:45:14,720 --> 02:45:18,000
weaknesses on uh on the boot chain

3819
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,080
which would allow attacker to manipulate

3820
02:45:20,080 --> 02:45:22,160
the the platform

3821
02:45:22,160 --> 02:45:25,520
and um inject the components during the

3822
02:45:25,520 --> 02:45:28,800
early boot phases very interesting was

3823
02:45:28,800 --> 02:45:30,000
the research

3824
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:33,040
golden key kaspersky kaspersky

3825
02:45:33,040 --> 02:45:34,560
bootloader is basically legitimate

3826
02:45:34,560 --> 02:45:35,920
bootloader which is

3827
02:45:35,920 --> 02:45:37,520
uh not maintaining signature

3828
02:45:37,520 --> 02:45:39,120
verification after that

3829
02:45:39,120 --> 02:45:41,600
so the attacker could just bring it uh

3830
02:45:41,600 --> 02:45:43,520
launch it and then run any uncertain

3831
02:45:43,520 --> 02:45:45,439
code after that

3832
02:45:45,439 --> 02:45:47,439
and there was a lot of work related all

3833
02:45:47,439 --> 02:45:49,120
for how can you trust

3834
02:45:49,120 --> 02:45:52,319
early stages before bootloader like

3835
02:45:52,319 --> 02:45:55,120
spi content spi protection runtime

3836
02:45:55,120 --> 02:45:56,000
protection of the

3837
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:59,120
smm different components different other

3838
02:45:59,120 --> 02:46:00,800
components protection and how they can

3839
02:46:00,800 --> 02:46:01,359
be

3840
02:46:01,359 --> 02:46:03,760
impacted early stage dma attacks and

3841
02:46:03,760 --> 02:46:05,040
things like that

3842
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:07,600
a lot of interesting work was done there

3843
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:08,960
when we're talking about kind of what

3844
02:46:08,960 --> 02:46:10,240
kind of risks

3845
02:46:10,240 --> 02:46:13,600
we possibly can find uh and exist

3846
02:46:13,600 --> 02:46:16,160
on this blue chain um there could be a

3847
02:46:16,160 --> 02:46:17,520
couple categories

3848
02:46:17,520 --> 02:46:20,319
one category could be a misconfiguration

3849
02:46:20,319 --> 02:46:21,600
and that's a big one

3850
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:24,000
so someone believed that some some

3851
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,240
register should be locked or certain

3852
02:46:26,240 --> 02:46:27,520
certain characteristics should be done

3853
02:46:27,520 --> 02:46:29,920
in one way but it was not

3854
02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:32,399
uh maintain it well until the operation

3855
02:46:32,399 --> 02:46:33,040
phase

3856
02:46:33,040 --> 02:46:35,680
and certain configuration was not

3857
02:46:35,680 --> 02:46:36,720
setting up and the

3858
02:46:36,720 --> 02:46:38,720
attacker could use it to basically

3859
02:46:38,720 --> 02:46:40,399
disable or

3860
02:46:40,399 --> 02:46:43,279
inject the code inside the system and it

3861
02:46:43,279 --> 02:46:45,200
could be implementation issues

3862
02:46:45,200 --> 02:46:47,840
so it could be uh just a buffer flow

3863
02:46:47,840 --> 02:46:48,720
type of issue

3864
02:46:48,720 --> 02:46:51,200
and that's all present in the firmware

3865
02:46:51,200 --> 02:46:53,520
because most of the from a wrote on see

3866
02:46:53,520 --> 02:46:56,240
and they basically are acceptable to

3867
02:46:56,240 --> 02:46:57,600
this type of buffer or flow type of

3868
02:46:57,600 --> 02:46:58,560
vulnerability

3869
02:46:58,560 --> 02:47:02,880
in almost any phase and then we see that

3870
02:47:02,880 --> 02:47:04,479
this vulnerability could be in sign of

3871
02:47:04,479 --> 02:47:06,399
bootloaders and as i mentioned

3872
02:47:06,399 --> 02:47:07,359
previously bootloaders is

3873
02:47:07,359 --> 02:47:09,120
interchangeable so that

3874
02:47:09,120 --> 02:47:10,880
gives a lot of flexibility for the

3875
02:47:10,880 --> 02:47:13,120
attacker and it could be

3876
02:47:13,120 --> 02:47:15,120
awesome as i mentioned misconfiguration

3877
02:47:15,120 --> 02:47:17,120
but special type of misconfiguration

3878
02:47:17,120 --> 02:47:19,520
like unsigned component so if you really

3879
02:47:19,520 --> 02:47:20,640
kind of try to build

3880
02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:23,120
this signature verification process you

3881
02:47:23,120 --> 02:47:24,800
must to be worried about

3882
02:47:24,800 --> 02:47:26,479
every single pointer and every single

3883
02:47:26,479 --> 02:47:29,040
instruction if you're running any single

3884
02:47:29,040 --> 02:47:29,920
instruction

3885
02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:33,120
or if you're not getting integrity of

3886
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:36,479
and one any single pointer then it would

3887
02:47:36,479 --> 02:47:38,800
allow the attacker to find that and

3888
02:47:38,800 --> 02:47:42,080
basically manipulate that

3889
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:44,960
there was some vulnerability showing uh

3890
02:47:44,960 --> 02:47:46,399
from the bypassing different hardware

3891
02:47:46,399 --> 02:47:47,600
route of trust

3892
02:47:47,600 --> 02:47:50,240
intel boot guard bypasses from the

3893
02:47:50,240 --> 02:47:51,680
different companies

3894
02:47:51,680 --> 02:47:53,520
um different research group and we

3895
02:47:53,520 --> 02:47:54,880
demonstrate how to

3896
02:47:54,880 --> 02:47:57,439
bypass hp sure start with the dmi

3897
02:47:57,439 --> 02:47:58,800
attacks and those

3898
02:47:58,800 --> 02:48:00,840
other vulnerabilities shown in a

3899
02:48:00,840 --> 02:48:02,000
different

3900
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,399
different area of harder route of stats

3901
02:48:04,399 --> 02:48:05,279
as well so

3902
02:48:05,279 --> 02:48:07,520
demonstrating that in every single step

3903
02:48:07,520 --> 02:48:10,479
you may have an issues

3904
02:48:10,479 --> 02:48:11,760
and that number of vulnerability

3905
02:48:11,760 --> 02:48:13,680
government over years

3906
02:48:13,680 --> 02:48:15,600
is just some statistical representation

3907
02:48:15,600 --> 02:48:17,840
on the problem

3908
02:48:17,840 --> 02:48:19,920
uh so when we're talking about like

3909
02:48:19,920 --> 02:48:20,880
specifically

3910
02:48:20,880 --> 02:48:24,160
uh bootloaders uh one of them

3911
02:48:24,160 --> 02:48:27,120
one of their previous work was done that

3912
02:48:27,120 --> 02:48:27,680
um

3913
02:48:27,680 --> 02:48:31,120
that legacy ubuntu or graph

3914
02:48:31,120 --> 02:48:33,760
graph was signed but didn't check the

3915
02:48:33,760 --> 02:48:35,439
signature of the latest stage

3916
02:48:35,439 --> 02:48:37,520
which was also used uh could be used by

3917
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:39,040
the attacker to

3918
02:48:39,040 --> 02:48:43,439
um basically install um

3919
02:48:43,439 --> 02:48:46,720
install their their rootkit um

3920
02:48:46,720 --> 02:48:50,640
so um yeah let me move on

3921
02:48:50,640 --> 02:48:52,960
um as a type of weaknesses and

3922
02:48:52,960 --> 02:48:54,160
architecture

3923
02:48:54,160 --> 02:48:56,000
uh which is very related to what i was

3924
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:57,359
explaining with

3925
02:48:57,359 --> 02:49:00,399
interchangeable binaries so then

3926
02:49:00,399 --> 02:49:03,200
someone could just bring a vulnerable

3927
02:49:03,200 --> 02:49:04,160
binary

3928
02:49:04,160 --> 02:49:06,720
a venerable bootloader to the system in

3929
02:49:06,720 --> 02:49:07,680
order to

3930
02:49:07,680 --> 02:49:10,000
replace a legitimate one and that would

3931
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:11,600
be sign it and then

3932
02:49:11,600 --> 02:49:13,760
exploit that vulnerable bootloader in

3933
02:49:13,760 --> 02:49:15,600
order to

3934
02:49:15,600 --> 02:49:18,080
inject the attacker's code and the

3935
02:49:18,080 --> 02:49:19,040
architecture is

3936
02:49:19,040 --> 02:49:20,960
fully flexible for that so if you're

3937
02:49:20,960 --> 02:49:22,160
talking about like

3938
02:49:22,160 --> 02:49:24,960
having a way um having a way to

3939
02:49:24,960 --> 02:49:25,920
manipulate this

3940
02:49:25,920 --> 02:49:28,240
would be the you know one of the first

3941
02:49:28,240 --> 02:49:30,000
thing which will attacker will look

3942
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:33,840
and in many cases uh evil made attacks

3943
02:49:33,840 --> 02:49:35,680
is outside of the scope for many threat

3944
02:49:35,680 --> 02:49:37,040
models i didn't

3945
02:49:37,040 --> 02:49:38,640
talk a lot about threat modeling but

3946
02:49:38,640 --> 02:49:40,560
it's another uh

3947
02:49:40,560 --> 02:49:43,439
it's another big area on there they're

3948
02:49:43,439 --> 02:49:45,200
basically

3949
02:49:45,200 --> 02:49:48,319
then oems and others um build a threat

3950
02:49:48,319 --> 02:49:50,319
model with certain one assumptions

3951
02:49:50,319 --> 02:49:52,240
but evil made is outside of the scope

3952
02:49:52,240 --> 02:49:55,439
for many of them and

3953
02:49:56,160 --> 02:49:59,359
evil mate could be easily injecting the

3954
02:49:59,359 --> 02:50:00,160
code

3955
02:50:00,160 --> 02:50:03,439
uh in the linux boot flow and

3956
02:50:03,439 --> 02:50:06,240
overall ufi partition which is basically

3957
02:50:06,240 --> 02:50:08,479
a storage where the ufi bootloader will

3958
02:50:08,479 --> 02:50:09,439
be stored

3959
02:50:09,439 --> 02:50:11,840
is unencrypted so whoever has fixed

3960
02:50:11,840 --> 02:50:13,520
physical access to the box

3961
02:50:13,520 --> 02:50:15,200
can manipulate it even if you have full

3962
02:50:15,200 --> 02:50:17,120
disk encryption that part will not be

3963
02:50:17,120 --> 02:50:19,040
there it will not be encrypted

3964
02:50:19,040 --> 02:50:21,840
so now um that was a very good overview

3965
02:50:21,840 --> 02:50:23,439
of the different aspects which is

3966
02:50:23,439 --> 02:50:24,479
referencing too many different

3967
02:50:24,479 --> 02:50:26,880
theoretical practical works so now it's

3968
02:50:26,880 --> 02:50:28,640
a little bit about boot hall

3969
02:50:28,640 --> 02:50:32,479
and uh so in uh in last year we start

3970
02:50:32,479 --> 02:50:34,080
looking for the bootloader

3971
02:50:34,080 --> 02:50:36,000
and look for the what the weaknesses put

3972
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:37,120
loader may have

3973
02:50:37,120 --> 02:50:38,960
because they are very crucial piece on

3974
02:50:38,960 --> 02:50:40,319
the boot flow

3975
02:50:40,319 --> 02:50:41,920
and we was looking specifically on the

3976
02:50:41,920 --> 02:50:44,640
graph and how grip is handling the

3977
02:50:44,640 --> 02:50:47,760
grab config file which is um in

3978
02:50:47,760 --> 02:50:50,880
in base in basic default configuration

3979
02:50:50,880 --> 02:50:53,760
is not sign it and can be manipulated by

3980
02:50:53,760 --> 02:50:54,880
the attacker

3981
02:50:54,880 --> 02:50:58,080
and what we found that uh that the grub

3982
02:50:58,080 --> 02:50:59,920
has the vulnerability how they

3983
02:50:59,920 --> 02:51:02,319
they handle the gap config file and the

3984
02:51:02,319 --> 02:51:03,600
attacker could use it

3985
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:06,640
to inject code to the system that's

3986
02:51:06,640 --> 02:51:08,720
exactly where the boot hole was

3987
02:51:08,720 --> 02:51:11,680
um just couple details here it was

3988
02:51:11,680 --> 02:51:13,600
basically bug between uh

3989
02:51:13,600 --> 02:51:16,720
code generated by from flex and the

3990
02:51:16,720 --> 02:51:17,359
graph

3991
02:51:17,359 --> 02:51:19,680
markers definition how it basically done

3992
02:51:19,680 --> 02:51:20,479
when you see

3993
02:51:20,479 --> 02:51:23,120
this marker here then you will see that

3994
02:51:23,120 --> 02:51:24,880
uh your fatal error

3995
02:51:24,880 --> 02:51:26,960
is just continue going and doesn't

3996
02:51:26,960 --> 02:51:28,720
interrupt any processes

3997
02:51:28,720 --> 02:51:32,640
which is basically which is basically

3998
02:51:32,640 --> 02:51:35,760
um was not was what is expected by the

3999
02:51:35,760 --> 02:51:38,000
uh flex generated code and this

4000
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:38,880
basically

4001
02:51:38,880 --> 02:51:40,560
misunderstanding between different kind

4002
02:51:40,560 --> 02:51:42,319
of integration blocks

4003
02:51:42,319 --> 02:51:44,160
uh during the implementation cause this

4004
02:51:44,160 --> 02:51:46,160
uh caused this mistake

4005
02:51:46,160 --> 02:51:48,399
and it it takes a year to found this

4006
02:51:48,399 --> 02:51:49,520
vulnerability

4007
02:51:49,520 --> 02:51:51,680
because by code audit and no static

4008
02:51:51,680 --> 02:51:54,399
analysis tools will detect that

4009
02:51:54,399 --> 02:51:56,880
but in another hand uh there was not

4010
02:51:56,880 --> 02:51:58,080
enough significant

4011
02:51:58,080 --> 02:51:59,920
effort on the dynamic analysis and

4012
02:51:59,920 --> 02:52:01,680
fuzzing uh to the group

4013
02:52:01,680 --> 02:52:04,160
until we basically arrived to that area

4014
02:52:04,160 --> 02:52:05,600
when we chatted with the

4015
02:52:05,600 --> 02:52:08,160
maintainers on the ground we found a lot

4016
02:52:08,160 --> 02:52:10,240
of interesting details about priorities

4017
02:52:10,240 --> 02:52:13,439
and how much security attention was

4018
02:52:13,439 --> 02:52:16,640
pointing to the grub and yeah it is a

4019
02:52:16,640 --> 02:52:18,479
little bit logical bug and stain between

4020
02:52:18,479 --> 02:52:20,000
components and integration

4021
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:21,200
maybe you can call it a little bit on

4022
02:52:21,200 --> 02:52:23,359
supply chain risks but it still could be

4023
02:52:23,359 --> 02:52:24,560
found dynamically

4024
02:52:24,560 --> 02:52:27,279
if there would be enough resources

4025
02:52:27,279 --> 02:52:28,000
allocated to

4026
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:31,120
the fuzzer of graphs so and then

4027
02:52:31,120 --> 02:52:32,720
when you have the overflow you will

4028
02:52:32,720 --> 02:52:35,359
control felix

4029
02:52:35,359 --> 02:52:37,600
felix structure which will basically

4030
02:52:37,600 --> 02:52:38,720
will go to the

4031
02:52:38,720 --> 02:52:40,960
street copy when you will control

4032
02:52:40,960 --> 02:52:42,479
destination address which is very

4033
02:52:42,479 --> 02:52:43,520
classical

4034
02:52:43,520 --> 02:52:45,439
overflow issue when you can control

4035
02:52:45,439 --> 02:52:47,040
where you will write and what value you

4036
02:52:47,040 --> 02:52:47,520
will

4037
02:52:47,520 --> 02:52:49,680
write which is basically called write

4038
02:52:49,680 --> 02:52:50,640
primitive

4039
02:52:50,640 --> 02:52:53,279
and in case of the graph which doesn't

4040
02:52:53,279 --> 02:52:55,120
have islr and dp

4041
02:52:55,120 --> 02:52:57,920
any of the exploit prevention technology

4042
02:52:57,920 --> 02:53:00,640
uh it basically 100 exploitable flow

4043
02:53:00,640 --> 02:53:02,720
so you can basically exploit this and

4044
02:53:02,720 --> 02:53:03,760
inject code

4045
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:06,399
uh in the grub during the boot uh boot

4046
02:53:06,399 --> 02:53:06,880
chain

4047
02:53:06,880 --> 02:53:11,120
by manipulating the config file um

4048
02:53:11,120 --> 02:53:13,120
moving on interestingly part that you

4049
02:53:13,120 --> 02:53:14,640
can say yeah but we could monitor

4050
02:53:14,640 --> 02:53:16,880
uh config file yes you can but you need

4051
02:53:16,880 --> 02:53:17,760
to do it uh

4052
02:53:17,760 --> 02:53:19,680
with the certain assumption because

4053
02:53:19,680 --> 02:53:21,600
someone can basically

4054
02:53:21,600 --> 02:53:24,240
hook the way how you would read the file

4055
02:53:24,240 --> 02:53:24,960
system

4056
02:53:24,960 --> 02:53:27,600
and will return you the fake config file

4057
02:53:27,600 --> 02:53:28,319
because

4058
02:53:28,319 --> 02:53:29,680
graph is running before the operation

4059
02:53:29,680 --> 02:53:31,359
system so operation system at that point

4060
02:53:31,359 --> 02:53:32,319
is not trusted

4061
02:53:32,319 --> 02:53:33,760
so from the forensic perspective you

4062
02:53:33,760 --> 02:53:35,920
need to do much more work to make sure

4063
02:53:35,920 --> 02:53:36,960
that you're really

4064
02:53:36,960 --> 02:53:40,960
reading the file which is was not

4065
02:53:40,960 --> 02:53:44,160
not hooked and not faked so when we

4066
02:53:44,160 --> 02:53:45,680
found this vulnerability

4067
02:53:45,680 --> 02:53:48,880
uh in grub

4068
02:53:49,120 --> 02:53:52,880
then um we open up uh interesting box of

4069
02:53:52,880 --> 02:53:54,319
all sorts of vulnerability and graham

4070
02:53:54,319 --> 02:53:54,880
because

4071
02:53:54,880 --> 02:53:56,080
apparently there was not enough

4072
02:53:56,080 --> 02:53:58,640
attention to the grub and no one

4073
02:53:58,640 --> 02:54:01,120
taking care of the grub overall so all

4074
02:54:01,120 --> 02:54:03,120
sorts of different vulnerabilities

4075
02:54:03,120 --> 02:54:05,439
and even more found after that based on

4076
02:54:05,439 --> 02:54:07,279
our initial kind of push

4077
02:54:07,279 --> 02:54:09,920
on that direction and all of this kind

4078
02:54:09,920 --> 02:54:10,880
of uh

4079
02:54:10,880 --> 02:54:12,399
vulnerabilities and different aspects

4080
02:54:12,399 --> 02:54:14,080
was found the more resources was

4081
02:54:14,080 --> 02:54:15,120
allocated by

4082
02:54:15,120 --> 02:54:17,040
communities thanks everyone who was

4083
02:54:17,040 --> 02:54:18,399
taking care of that

4084
02:54:18,399 --> 02:54:21,520
i know that's a lot of work there uh

4085
02:54:21,520 --> 02:54:23,439
and even more the nasa was very

4086
02:54:23,439 --> 02:54:25,040
important aspects there

4087
02:54:25,040 --> 02:54:27,439
and i'm almost finishing on the main

4088
02:54:27,439 --> 02:54:28,880
presentation is

4089
02:54:28,880 --> 02:54:31,439
uh architecture if you remember that

4090
02:54:31,439 --> 02:54:32,960
interchangeable piece

4091
02:54:32,960 --> 02:54:36,399
is very um was very flexible but it has

4092
02:54:36,399 --> 02:54:37,120
also the

4093
02:54:37,120 --> 02:54:39,040
downside so if you're thinking about

4094
02:54:39,040 --> 02:54:41,120
each crop was vulnerable

4095
02:54:41,120 --> 02:54:43,920
then meaning that each shim which is a

4096
02:54:43,920 --> 02:54:45,279
triggy and grab

4097
02:54:45,279 --> 02:54:47,359
also part of the vulnerable chain so you

4098
02:54:47,359 --> 02:54:49,120
need to start reworking all of this

4099
02:54:49,120 --> 02:54:49,920
process

4100
02:54:49,920 --> 02:54:52,479
and rework and grab is very complicated

4101
02:54:52,479 --> 02:54:54,080
because it's thousands of them

4102
02:54:54,080 --> 02:54:56,319
so the decision was made that that will

4103
02:54:56,319 --> 02:54:58,399
be reworked all of that shrimps

4104
02:54:58,399 --> 02:55:00,080
and then they will be basically update

4105
02:55:00,080 --> 02:55:02,399
all shims in order to co

4106
02:55:02,399 --> 02:55:04,720
in order to basically launch

4107
02:55:04,720 --> 02:55:06,800
non-vulnerable updated grubs

4108
02:55:06,800 --> 02:55:09,200
but even number of shims was very

4109
02:55:09,200 --> 02:55:10,240
significant

4110
02:55:10,240 --> 02:55:12,800
there was about i think 200 plus

4111
02:55:12,800 --> 02:55:14,319
different shims which would need to be

4112
02:55:14,319 --> 02:55:15,040
revoked

4113
02:55:15,040 --> 02:55:16,640
but if you remember when i was mentioned

4114
02:55:16,640 --> 02:55:19,600
that db and dbx database stored in space

4115
02:55:19,600 --> 02:55:20,319
storage

4116
02:55:20,319 --> 02:55:22,800
sps storage is very very limited it

4117
02:55:22,800 --> 02:55:25,200
could be 16 megabytes and nvram could be

4118
02:55:25,200 --> 02:55:26,319
one megabyte

4119
02:55:26,319 --> 02:55:29,359
and then dbx size could be up to uh

4120
02:55:29,359 --> 02:55:32,319
i i don't know maybe 650 entries so you

4121
02:55:32,319 --> 02:55:34,479
can only rework 650

4122
02:55:34,479 --> 02:55:36,880
binaries and if your wheels with one

4123
02:55:36,880 --> 02:55:39,120
vulnerability will rework

4124
02:55:39,120 --> 02:55:42,000
they will use 200 entries then basically

4125
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:43,520
three of this iteration

4126
02:55:43,520 --> 02:55:45,920
will fully exhaust all of your storage

4127
02:55:45,920 --> 02:55:47,120
for the dbx

4128
02:55:47,120 --> 02:55:49,920
which would mean that after that secure

4129
02:55:49,920 --> 02:55:52,000
boot will start unfunctional because

4130
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,800
there will be always binary which will

4131
02:55:54,800 --> 02:55:55,600
not be

4132
02:55:55,600 --> 02:55:58,160
reworked which will be vulnerable could

4133
02:55:58,160 --> 02:55:59,840
be used by the attacker

4134
02:55:59,840 --> 02:56:02,479
to to basically inject code into so

4135
02:56:02,479 --> 02:56:04,000
that's why the industry created

4136
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:04,960
assumptions which is called

4137
02:56:04,960 --> 02:56:08,160
s-bot as but is basically slicing on the

4138
02:56:08,160 --> 02:56:10,240
level when you don't need to rework

4139
02:56:10,240 --> 02:56:12,720
the entire generation of shim you

4140
02:56:12,720 --> 02:56:13,760
basically need to

4141
02:56:13,760 --> 02:56:16,000
increase the counter and basically it's

4142
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,000
sort of a kind of generation slicing

4143
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:18,720
when you

4144
02:56:18,720 --> 02:56:22,000
can basically use less space to revoke

4145
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:22,720
all of that

4146
02:56:22,720 --> 02:56:25,760
generation on shrimps during the boot

4147
02:56:25,760 --> 02:56:26,960
sequence very

4148
02:56:26,960 --> 02:56:29,920
very great solution uh to balance

4149
02:56:29,920 --> 02:56:31,760
between the size of the

4150
02:56:31,760 --> 02:56:34,720
nvram and dbx and how many revocation

4151
02:56:34,720 --> 02:56:36,960
needed each time when this type of the

4152
02:56:36,960 --> 02:56:40,160
vulnerability dis disclosed this

4153
02:56:40,160 --> 02:56:42,960
this vulnerability effect all of that uh

4154
02:56:42,960 --> 02:56:43,840
boxes which is

4155
02:56:43,840 --> 02:56:47,040
uh you have ufi secure boot it could be

4156
02:56:47,040 --> 02:56:48,640
a normal boxes it could be network

4157
02:56:48,640 --> 02:56:50,160
compliances it could be

4158
02:56:50,160 --> 02:56:53,040
all sorts of different devices so when

4159
02:56:53,040 --> 02:56:54,560
we're talking about mitigation

4160
02:56:54,560 --> 02:56:56,240
it should be very precise flow to

4161
02:56:56,240 --> 02:56:57,600
mitigated it because

4162
02:56:57,600 --> 02:56:59,359
if you will update dbx before you will

4163
02:56:59,359 --> 02:57:01,439
update bootloader system will not boot

4164
02:57:01,439 --> 02:57:03,600
so you will need to follow very precise

4165
02:57:03,600 --> 02:57:05,520
mitigation steps when you first

4166
02:57:05,520 --> 02:57:07,200
update bootloaders and then you will

4167
02:57:07,200 --> 02:57:09,279
verify that there is no dual boot or

4168
02:57:09,279 --> 02:57:11,279
no a special configuration there and

4169
02:57:11,279 --> 02:57:12,800
then you will update dbx

4170
02:57:12,800 --> 02:57:15,520
so mitigation is very specific there and

4171
02:57:15,520 --> 02:57:16,000
then

4172
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:19,200
uh it could be some of that instability

4173
02:57:19,200 --> 02:57:20,560
issue if you're talking about

4174
02:57:20,560 --> 02:57:22,240
the provisioning machine so dual boot

4175
02:57:22,240 --> 02:57:24,080
scenario things like that

4176
02:57:24,080 --> 02:57:27,359
um and then having this this um

4177
02:57:27,359 --> 02:57:29,279
disaster recovery plan if this type of

4178
02:57:29,279 --> 02:57:30,640
situation happens

4179
02:57:30,640 --> 02:57:33,920
would be very good practices overall um

4180
02:57:33,920 --> 02:57:34,880
and

4181
02:57:34,880 --> 02:57:37,680
even nowadays we see more relocation

4182
02:57:37,680 --> 02:57:38,479
happen so

4183
02:57:38,479 --> 02:57:40,560
i think about a month ago there was

4184
02:57:40,560 --> 02:57:42,640
another dbx update so following

4185
02:57:42,640 --> 02:57:44,479
what is inside the dbx updates from

4186
02:57:44,479 --> 02:57:45,680
microsoft and

4187
02:57:45,680 --> 02:57:48,319
other kind of sources like ufi forum

4188
02:57:48,319 --> 02:57:50,399
will give you a good idea of

4189
02:57:50,399 --> 02:57:52,160
what kind of vulnerabilities was fixed

4190
02:57:52,160 --> 02:57:54,720
in the bootloaders

4191
02:57:54,720 --> 02:57:56,640
so some of the recommendation uh to

4192
02:57:56,640 --> 02:57:58,240
monitor

4193
02:57:58,240 --> 02:58:01,600
the ufi partition and to continuously

4194
02:58:01,600 --> 02:58:02,720
install the os

4195
02:58:02,720 --> 02:58:04,880
updates is like available to check

4196
02:58:04,880 --> 02:58:05,840
offline

4197
02:58:05,840 --> 02:58:07,520
so one of the things when we're talking

4198
02:58:07,520 --> 02:58:08,880
about like boot kits and

4199
02:58:08,880 --> 02:58:12,000
and rootkits is basically

4200
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:15,600
uh to look on the ufi partition

4201
02:58:15,600 --> 02:58:17,359
and see what the content there and

4202
02:58:17,359 --> 02:58:19,279
understand better how the boot flow

4203
02:58:19,279 --> 02:58:20,080
works

4204
02:58:20,080 --> 02:58:21,920
and have a more visibility to the boot

4205
02:58:21,920 --> 02:58:24,080
flow and even before the

4206
02:58:24,080 --> 02:58:26,000
operation system even they can face on

4207
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:27,120
the firmware but

4208
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:28,640
specifically in boot loader and it's not

4209
02:58:28,640 --> 02:58:30,160
hard it's just a

4210
02:58:30,160 --> 02:58:33,520
specially mounted ufo partition and the

4211
02:58:33,520 --> 02:58:36,319
files is there is the normal

4212
02:58:36,319 --> 02:58:38,399
pe file so you can get a hash you can

4213
02:58:38,399 --> 02:58:39,600
check your signature

4214
02:58:39,600 --> 02:58:41,439
you can make a database whitelist

4215
02:58:41,439 --> 02:58:43,279
blacklist you can cross correlate it to

4216
02:58:43,279 --> 02:58:44,880
the dbx

4217
02:58:44,880 --> 02:58:46,720
and there's a couple of nice tools which

4218
02:58:46,720 --> 02:58:48,960
is could help you to do that is dbx tool

4219
02:58:48,960 --> 02:58:50,560
one of that

4220
02:58:50,560 --> 02:58:54,080
tools there um uh

4221
02:58:54,080 --> 02:58:56,240
so they're just more screenshots and a

4222
02:58:56,240 --> 02:58:57,760
little bit more disk uh

4223
02:58:57,760 --> 02:59:00,080
explanation on what should be monitored

4224
02:59:00,080 --> 02:59:01,439
and

4225
02:59:01,439 --> 02:59:04,560
um and and how

4226
02:59:04,560 --> 02:59:07,040
so that's mostly it i'm trying to make

4227
02:59:07,040 --> 02:59:08,080
on time i

4228
02:59:08,080 --> 02:59:10,240
i think i'm have maybe one or two extra

4229
02:59:10,240 --> 02:59:12,000
minutes but we can use that extra

4230
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:13,600
minutes on the

we go to the next title of the

4267
03:00:49,840 --> 03:00:51,840
from remote access terminals to

4268
03:00:51,840 --> 03:00:53,920
extorting multi-billions companies

4269
03:00:53,920 --> 03:00:56,160
the evolution of the modern ransomware

4270
03:00:56,160 --> 03:00:57,359
group

4271
03:00:57,359 --> 03:00:59,040
well ransomware attacks are becoming

4272
03:00:59,040 --> 03:01:00,800
more widespread aiming entities in

4273
03:01:00,800 --> 03:01:03,120
industry not only i.t but ot

4274
03:01:03,120 --> 03:01:05,680
as cyber tractor techniques is also

4275
03:01:05,680 --> 03:01:07,160
advanced nowadays with the

4276
03:01:07,160 --> 03:01:08,479
anti-decryption

4277
03:01:08,479 --> 03:01:11,359
situation take down target the victims

4278
03:01:11,359 --> 03:01:11,920
aiming

4279
03:01:11,920 --> 03:01:13,920
recent vulnerabilities and also

4280
03:01:13,920 --> 03:01:15,520
extending their threat with

4281
03:01:15,520 --> 03:01:18,000
extortion of the data leakage having

4282
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:18,640
said that

4283
03:01:18,640 --> 03:01:21,279
the speaker mr fernando mercies will

4284
03:01:21,279 --> 03:01:22,479
examine the

4285
03:01:22,479 --> 03:01:24,399
details of techniques tactics and

4286
03:01:24,399 --> 03:01:26,720
processes of the ransomware in this case

4287
03:01:26,720 --> 03:01:29,760
nephilim runs away right yes that's

4288
03:01:29,760 --> 03:01:31,040
correct yes it is uh

4289
03:01:31,040 --> 03:01:33,439
i think a base of the name t source code

4290
03:01:33,439 --> 03:01:35,359
and its gang's activities will be

4291
03:01:35,359 --> 03:01:36,640
explained since uh

4292
03:01:36,640 --> 03:01:40,160
around march 2020 to make us understand

4293
03:01:40,160 --> 03:01:41,840
about that their operational tactics is

4294
03:01:41,840 --> 03:01:42,479
uh

4295
03:01:42,479 --> 03:01:44,240
good for us to make us better to defend

4296
03:01:44,240 --> 03:01:45,600
ourselves so let's welcome

4297
03:01:45,600 --> 03:01:48,800
the speaker mr fernando mercies uh the

4298
03:01:48,800 --> 03:01:50,800
cyber crime investigator from the trend

4299
03:01:50,800 --> 03:01:53,040
micro who is presenting this talk

4300
03:01:53,040 --> 03:01:55,760
based on the reverse engineering of cpi

4301
03:01:55,760 --> 03:01:57,279
skills and the decisive and

4302
03:01:57,279 --> 03:01:59,680
using those basically discipline grounds

4303
03:01:59,680 --> 03:02:01,600
for his investigations

4304
03:02:01,600 --> 03:02:04,880
so fernando does the the floor

4305
03:02:04,880 --> 03:02:09,040

i will um sorry i've just reshared it

4310
03:02:27,040 --> 03:02:31,680
something happened here

4311
03:02:31,680 --> 03:02:35,600
yeah and uh yeah so my plan is to

4312
03:02:35,600 --> 03:02:38,640
talk about this this group this

4313
03:02:38,640 --> 03:02:41,840
and this um this group we've been

4314
03:02:41,840 --> 03:02:43,200
calling them

4315
03:02:43,200 --> 03:02:47,200
water rock it's uh

4316
03:02:47,200 --> 03:02:49,520
it's a very interesting uh piece of

4317
03:02:49,520 --> 03:02:50,399
study

4318
03:02:50,399 --> 03:02:54,720
on on this nephilim racer

4319
03:02:54,720 --> 03:02:58,240
and uh everything that's behind it

4320
03:02:58,240 --> 03:03:02,640
so now yes all right look good

4321
03:03:02,640 --> 03:03:06,080
okay thank you okay uh

4322
03:03:06,080 --> 03:03:09,359
so let's start let's see what this

4323
03:03:09,359 --> 03:03:13,439
group in this rancher campaign is about

4324
03:03:13,439 --> 03:03:16,960
well first of all i would like to say

4325
03:03:16,960 --> 03:03:17,760
that

4326
03:03:17,760 --> 03:03:21,840
we've seen a shift into this

4327
03:03:21,840 --> 03:03:25,040
rancher the business model

4328
03:03:25,040 --> 03:03:28,160
in the past few years

4329
03:03:28,160 --> 03:03:31,359
so basically we could

4330
03:03:31,359 --> 03:03:34,720
observe three different models

4331
03:03:34,720 --> 03:03:37,840
and recently the idea

4332
03:03:37,840 --> 03:03:41,279
actually behind these attacks is that we

4333
03:03:41,279 --> 03:03:41,600
see

4334
03:03:41,600 --> 03:03:45,359
more and more um common things

4335
03:03:45,359 --> 03:03:48,000
between the rancher attacks and the

4336
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:49,600
apt-like

4337
03:03:49,600 --> 03:03:52,800
or the targeted attacks of uh which is

4338
03:03:52,800 --> 03:03:53,520
the usual

4339
03:03:53,520 --> 03:03:56,720
usual for uh criminal monetization

4340
03:03:56,720 --> 03:04:00,960
so um basically what the message here is

4341
03:04:00,960 --> 03:04:01,520
um

4342
03:04:01,520 --> 03:04:04,880
it's not really like regular

4343
03:04:04,880 --> 03:04:08,240
malware or extremely spread cyber crime

4344
03:04:08,240 --> 03:04:12,240
we've seen the racer attacks using um

4345
03:04:12,240 --> 03:04:15,760
exploits and some uh

4346
03:04:15,760 --> 03:04:18,160
remote code execution exploits and lots

4347
03:04:18,160 --> 03:04:20,399
of uh

4348
03:04:20,399 --> 03:04:23,120
lots of commonalities with more targeted

4349
03:04:23,120 --> 03:04:23,840
attacks

4350
03:04:23,840 --> 03:04:26,880
and that also includes well previously

4351
03:04:26,880 --> 03:04:30,479
um we also see we also saw

4352
03:04:30,479 --> 03:04:33,920
some uh different models of affiliate

4353
03:04:33,920 --> 03:04:35,279
programs

4354
03:04:35,279 --> 03:04:37,279
and uh well i'm going to talk a little

4355
03:04:37,279 --> 03:04:39,200
bit about more about this

4356
03:04:39,200 --> 03:04:42,240
specifically for this group but this

4357
03:04:42,240 --> 03:04:42,720
shift

4358
03:04:42,720 --> 03:04:45,760
is important into this market i would

4359
03:04:45,760 --> 03:04:46,240
say if

4360
03:04:46,240 --> 03:04:51,120
we can call that uh of ransomware

4361
03:04:51,120 --> 03:04:54,240
so the evolutionary path for

4362
03:04:54,240 --> 03:04:57,359
this specific group it's

4363
03:04:57,359 --> 03:04:59,920
some it's an interesting aspect so we

4364
03:04:59,920 --> 03:05:00,880
first start

4365
03:05:00,880 --> 03:05:02,800
uh actually they started with another

4366
03:05:02,800 --> 03:05:04,000
menswear which was

4367
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:06,960
called the js worm i'm going to mention

4368
03:05:06,960 --> 03:05:08,399
this

4369
03:05:08,399 --> 03:05:12,080
also but this one in august 2019

4370
03:05:12,080 --> 03:05:15,200
is interesting because it's a slight

4371
03:05:15,200 --> 03:05:18,000
shift into the the operations because

4372
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:19,439
this one is not a rancher

4373
03:05:19,439 --> 03:05:21,840
this is from the same group and this is

4374
03:05:21,840 --> 03:05:23,359
called raspberry red

4375
03:05:23,359 --> 03:05:26,720
we spotted that in 2019 uh

4376
03:05:26,720 --> 03:05:30,000
so basically the actor here is um trying

4377
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:31,520
to sell

4378
03:05:31,520 --> 03:05:35,680
his creation and uh he mentions uh

4379
03:05:35,680 --> 03:05:38,880
like all the features and things that

4380
03:05:38,880 --> 03:05:39,359
the

4381
03:05:39,359 --> 03:05:43,520
the the rat is capable of doing

4382
03:05:43,520 --> 03:05:46,800
and it starts this with this um

4383
03:05:46,800 --> 03:05:49,600
the story starts with here uh also a

4384
03:05:49,600 --> 03:05:50,399
little bit

4385
03:05:50,399 --> 03:05:52,880
uh earlier with js worm another rancher

4386
03:05:52,880 --> 03:05:54,880
that i'm going to talk about as well

4387
03:05:54,880 --> 03:05:58,080
but then there is this rat

4388
03:05:58,080 --> 03:06:01,200
here in 2019

4389
03:06:01,200 --> 03:06:03,439
uh by the way the rents for the js were

4390
03:06:03,439 --> 03:06:05,439
uh we spotted that around

4391
03:06:05,439 --> 03:06:08,560
may also in 2019

4392
03:06:08,560 --> 03:06:11,560
um but yeah so the rat uh

4393
03:06:11,560 --> 03:06:13,040
[Music]

4394
03:06:13,040 --> 03:06:16,160
it uh well js1 also published uh

4395
03:06:16,160 --> 03:06:19,439
um a screenshot of uh

4396
03:06:19,439 --> 03:06:21,840
the capabilities of the rats and the one

4397
03:06:21,840 --> 03:06:24,160
thing that he's very proud about

4398
03:06:24,160 --> 03:06:27,840
is what he calls the hyde vnc

4399
03:06:27,840 --> 03:06:30,319
protocol or feature and that's

4400
03:06:30,319 --> 03:06:32,160
particularly interesting because

4401
03:06:32,160 --> 03:06:35,680
you know when criminals actually

4402
03:06:35,840 --> 03:06:38,399
put some names in things that we

4403
03:06:38,399 --> 03:06:40,240
apparently we don't know

4404
03:06:40,240 --> 03:06:41,840
and then we have sometimes we have a

4405
03:06:41,840 --> 03:06:44,160
hard time trying to figure out what they

4406
03:06:44,160 --> 03:06:45,279
are talking about

4407
03:06:45,279 --> 03:06:48,319
but in that case it's basically a vnc uh

4408
03:06:48,319 --> 03:06:48,960
connection

4409
03:06:48,960 --> 03:06:50,880
so a remote connection to see the

4410
03:06:50,880 --> 03:06:52,240
victim's user

4411
03:06:52,240 --> 03:06:55,120
and uh they started calling that hvmc

4412
03:06:55,120 --> 03:06:56,560
protocol which is not really

4413
03:06:56,560 --> 03:06:58,960
anything different than vnc it's just

4414
03:06:58,960 --> 03:07:00,240
they've

4415
03:07:00,240 --> 03:07:04,479
appended this hyde suffix

4416
03:07:04,479 --> 03:07:06,399
and uh that's one of the interesting

4417
03:07:06,399 --> 03:07:08,319
features of this uh

4418
03:07:08,319 --> 03:07:11,439
rat but it's a red in general uh the

4419
03:07:11,439 --> 03:07:12,479
fact is that this

4420
03:07:12,479 --> 03:07:15,040
helped uh this sector actually to get

4421
03:07:15,040 --> 03:07:15,520
some

4422
03:07:15,520 --> 03:07:17,920
reputation in underground forums when

4423
03:07:17,920 --> 03:07:19,439
they started this

4424
03:07:19,439 --> 03:07:23,439
and and also the js warm um restaurant

4425
03:07:23,439 --> 03:07:25,359
which is the the topic of this the

4426
03:07:25,359 --> 03:07:27,840
current uh screenshot

4427
03:07:27,840 --> 03:07:30,880
so yeah for this uh with this rinser

4428
03:07:30,880 --> 03:07:31,359
here

4429
03:07:31,359 --> 03:07:33,680
i also published they also started

4430
03:07:33,680 --> 03:07:37,120
advertising this in 2019

4431
03:07:37,120 --> 03:07:40,160
um then the reputation

4432
03:07:40,160 --> 03:07:43,200
started to increase uh like more

4433
03:07:43,200 --> 03:07:45,840
than uh than expected because well it

4434
03:07:45,840 --> 03:07:47,359
really worked and they had like

4435
03:07:47,359 --> 03:07:52,000
different versions uh some of them were

4436
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:54,640
people could actually decrypt others and

4437
03:07:54,640 --> 03:07:55,600
then they started

4438
03:07:55,600 --> 03:07:58,479
fixing things but then the important

4439
03:07:58,479 --> 03:07:59,760
thing here is is the

4440
03:07:59,760 --> 03:08:01,439
the partnership and the affiliates

4441
03:08:01,439 --> 03:08:03,359
program you know it's very clear

4442
03:08:03,359 --> 03:08:05,279
that they have these affiliate programs

4443
03:08:05,279 --> 03:08:07,840
very well designed in that case

4444
03:08:07,840 --> 03:08:10,720
they say in the bottom that they work in

4445
03:08:10,720 --> 03:08:11,359
a model

4446
03:08:11,359 --> 03:08:15,200
where 70 percent of the

4447
03:08:15,200 --> 03:08:18,479
the the money made of the ransom paid by

4448
03:08:18,479 --> 03:08:20,160
the victims uh

4449
03:08:20,160 --> 03:08:22,479
stays with the affiliates and then 30

4450
03:08:22,479 --> 03:08:24,479
percent for the developers in that case

4451
03:08:24,479 --> 03:08:24,960
for

4452
03:08:24,960 --> 03:08:27,359
the group that we call what a rock which

4453
03:08:27,359 --> 03:08:28,479
is the group of

4454
03:08:28,479 --> 03:08:32,160
js war actor so this is well

4455
03:08:32,160 --> 03:08:35,359
designed in and advertised with

4456
03:08:35,359 --> 03:08:40,160
pretty much everything that an affiliate

4457
03:08:40,160 --> 03:08:43,439
needs to know to start to join the

4458
03:08:43,439 --> 03:08:44,000
program

4459
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:47,439
and start victimizing as well

4460
03:08:47,439 --> 03:08:50,560
uh yeah so um

4461
03:08:50,560 --> 03:08:53,439
this this program is actually well the

4462
03:08:53,439 --> 03:08:54,560
the 90

4463
03:08:54,560 --> 03:08:57,600
um then they moved to a different uh

4464
03:08:57,600 --> 03:09:01,600
rancher uh still in 2019

4465
03:09:01,600 --> 03:09:04,800
that is known as an empty

4466
03:09:04,800 --> 03:09:07,200
and this is interesting because we've

4467
03:09:07,200 --> 03:09:09,680
seen in a single year three different

4468
03:09:09,680 --> 03:09:12,960
uh malware families by the same

4469
03:09:12,960 --> 03:09:16,240
group right and uh well at all this uh

4470
03:09:16,240 --> 03:09:16,800
most of

4471
03:09:16,800 --> 03:09:19,680
our studies based on nephilim uh in

4472
03:09:19,680 --> 03:09:21,600
order to understand the netherlands

4473
03:09:21,600 --> 03:09:24,720
business model and its evolution uh it's

4474
03:09:24,720 --> 03:09:26,319
really important to understand the

4475
03:09:26,319 --> 03:09:27,760
evolution of the other

4476
03:09:27,760 --> 03:09:31,040
um the other malware that they that

4477
03:09:31,040 --> 03:09:31,840
they've

4478
03:09:31,840 --> 03:09:34,960
developed so yes uh name t

4479
03:09:34,960 --> 03:09:39,840
affiliate program started in the in 2019

4480
03:09:39,840 --> 03:09:43,040
and he also featured some uh well

4481
03:09:43,040 --> 03:09:46,080
well some features that js1 ranger also

4482
03:09:46,080 --> 03:09:47,040
had

4483
03:09:47,040 --> 03:09:50,720
and a few more you know including

4484
03:09:50,720 --> 03:09:52,800
things that they they seem to be really

4485
03:09:52,800 --> 03:09:55,760
proud about as support for windows xp

4486
03:09:55,760 --> 03:09:59,200
and the file size

4487
03:09:59,200 --> 03:10:02,720
of the final render payload

4488
03:10:02,720 --> 03:10:06,160
uh we also spotted another ad from

4489
03:10:06,160 --> 03:10:10,560
from an empty brancher that is based on

4490
03:10:10,560 --> 03:10:13,200
it's very similar to the previous one

4491
03:10:13,200 --> 03:10:14,560
although there are more

4492
03:10:14,560 --> 03:10:17,520
information on this uh first they say

4493
03:10:17,520 --> 03:10:18,720
that they have only

4494
03:10:18,720 --> 03:10:22,000
25 seats for affiliates

4495
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:24,160
and they also mentioned that they will

4496
03:10:24,160 --> 03:10:25,520
not

4497
03:10:25,520 --> 03:10:28,560
attack or work on cis

4498
03:10:28,560 --> 03:10:31,920
countries and but this one

4499
03:10:31,920 --> 03:10:35,040
actually is this post was made by a

4500
03:10:35,040 --> 03:10:36,080
different actor

4501
03:10:36,080 --> 03:10:39,920
so a different name different nickname

4502
03:10:39,920 --> 03:10:42,319
that was advertising the same thing

4503
03:10:42,319 --> 03:10:46,319
so we started creating our um

4504
03:10:46,319 --> 03:10:48,239
intelligence around that and then

4505
03:10:48,239 --> 03:10:50,399
realized that maybe the actor has two

4506
03:10:50,399 --> 03:10:51,279
different names

4507
03:10:51,279 --> 03:10:53,279
maybe we are talking about two different

4508
03:10:53,279 --> 03:10:54,479
people working

4509
03:10:54,479 --> 03:10:58,399
in the same group and that's what we um

4510
03:10:58,399 --> 03:11:02,000
we spotted another interesting stuff was

4511
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:04,640
when they started using uh actually we

4512
03:11:04,640 --> 03:11:06,319
spotted this in a forum

4513
03:11:06,319 --> 03:11:10,080
and one of the actors uh was saying that

4514
03:11:10,080 --> 03:11:13,200
uh they they wanted someone

4515
03:11:13,200 --> 03:11:15,840
uh that could understand about crypters

4516
03:11:15,840 --> 03:11:17,120
because they

4517
03:11:17,120 --> 03:11:19,439
they needed they had this need of uh

4518
03:11:19,439 --> 03:11:20,319
encrypting

4519
03:11:20,319 --> 03:11:22,560
and making like cobalt strike becomes

4520
03:11:22,560 --> 03:11:23,680
undetectable

4521
03:11:23,680 --> 03:11:26,640
basically and that also helps us to

4522
03:11:26,640 --> 03:11:27,439
understand

4523
03:11:27,439 --> 03:11:31,120
the whole thing yes also

4524
03:11:31,120 --> 03:11:33,760
some characteristics about this group

4525
03:11:33,760 --> 03:11:35,439
involve like organization

4526
03:11:35,439 --> 03:11:38,000
the partnership management and as you

4527
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:40,479
could see from the previous slides

4528
03:11:40,479 --> 03:11:43,520
collaboration between

4529
03:11:43,520 --> 03:11:46,800
people right we spotted at least two

4530
03:11:46,800 --> 03:11:48,319
different actors or two different

4531
03:11:48,319 --> 03:11:50,880
handles and

4532
03:11:50,880 --> 03:11:54,239
they have a limited number of seats

4533
03:11:54,239 --> 03:11:56,950
there's also we also believe there is a

4534
03:11:56,950 --> 03:11:58,399
[Music]

4535
03:11:58,399 --> 03:12:01,040
like an interviewing process when uh

4536
03:12:01,040 --> 03:12:03,439
when someone wants to be one of their

4537
03:12:03,439 --> 03:12:06,479
affiliates so uh that's really uh

4538
03:12:06,479 --> 03:12:07,439
organized

4539
03:12:07,439 --> 03:12:10,640
um in our understanding

4540
03:12:10,640 --> 03:12:14,800
so yeah moving on to nephilim

4541
03:12:14,800 --> 03:12:16,880
then they started with navling which is

4542
03:12:16,880 --> 03:12:18,239
another campaign

4543
03:12:18,239 --> 03:12:21,120
and uh it's probably the biggest from

4544
03:12:21,120 --> 03:12:21,840
from this group

4545
03:12:21,840 --> 03:12:24,640
which is actually still active here's

4546
03:12:24,640 --> 03:12:26,319
the victimization map

4547
03:12:26,319 --> 03:12:29,279
that we came up with most of the victims

4548
03:12:29,279 --> 03:12:30,399
as you can see

4549
03:12:30,399 --> 03:12:33,359
are in north america and based on all of

4550
03:12:33,359 --> 03:12:34,479
the versions these

4551
03:12:34,479 --> 03:12:37,760
um these victims they they started

4552
03:12:37,760 --> 03:12:39,760
victimizing u.s

4553
03:12:39,760 --> 03:12:43,279
uh around q3 in

4554
03:12:43,279 --> 03:12:47,279
2020 from from q3 2010 to

4555
03:12:47,279 --> 03:12:50,960
q1 2021 but i actually have victims

4556
03:12:50,960 --> 03:12:54,080
in the many different sectors and in

4557
03:12:54,080 --> 03:12:54,479
almost

4558
03:12:54,479 --> 03:12:58,880
all continents so we can't say

4559
03:12:58,880 --> 03:13:01,840
they are targeting a specific uh vector

4560
03:13:01,840 --> 03:13:03,120
they are actually targeting

4561
03:13:03,120 --> 03:13:06,399
um big companies in general

4562
03:13:06,399 --> 03:13:09,520
so any uh company uh

4563
03:13:09,520 --> 03:13:12,000
big company can be a victim of these

4564
03:13:12,000 --> 03:13:14,160
these guys

4565
03:13:14,160 --> 03:13:17,439
uh the way in and how they do this well

4566
03:13:17,439 --> 03:13:21,470
we've spotted two different um

4567
03:13:21,470 --> 03:13:22,640
[Music]

4568
03:13:22,640 --> 03:13:25,200
vulnerabilities that they could exploit

4569
03:13:25,200 --> 03:13:25,680
actually

4570
03:13:25,680 --> 03:13:27,120
the first one's not really a

4571
03:13:27,120 --> 03:13:28,800
vulnerability it's basically a brute

4572
03:13:28,800 --> 03:13:30,239
forcing rdp

4573
03:13:30,239 --> 03:13:32,720
uh they also mentioned that well this

4574
03:13:32,720 --> 03:13:33,840
was also spotted

4575
03:13:33,840 --> 03:13:37,200
in js war transfer campaigns uh

4576
03:13:37,200 --> 03:13:40,720
but in the past js worm was more um

4577
03:13:40,720 --> 03:13:43,840
it was distributed by fishing and

4578
03:13:43,840 --> 03:13:46,239
exploit kits and botnets and all kinds

4579
03:13:46,239 --> 03:13:47,359
of things

4580
03:13:47,359 --> 03:13:51,200
but naflin differently is actually uh

4581
03:13:51,200 --> 03:13:55,359
more um selective so microsoft has the

4582
03:13:55,359 --> 03:13:57,680
so brute forcing rdp servers for sure

4583
03:13:57,680 --> 03:13:59,359
we've seen this happening

4584
03:13:59,359 --> 03:14:02,800
and also vulnerability on citrix

4585
03:14:02,800 --> 03:14:06,080
netscaler which is actually also

4586
03:14:06,080 --> 03:14:09,279
known as aedp i guess

4587
03:14:09,279 --> 03:14:11,760
so this vulnerability is also used by

4588
03:14:11,760 --> 03:14:12,960
these guys

4589
03:14:12,960 --> 03:14:16,000
to exploit um

4590
03:14:16,000 --> 03:14:19,840
as a way in then we comes for the

4591
03:14:19,840 --> 03:14:21,040
persistence

4592
03:14:21,040 --> 03:14:24,319
stage of the attack

4593
03:14:24,319 --> 03:14:28,399
some hacking tools or you know cs admin

4594
03:14:28,399 --> 03:14:31,359
network admin things like this this this

4595
03:14:31,359 --> 03:14:32,560
kind of tools

4596
03:14:32,560 --> 03:14:35,680
are definitely used for some

4597
03:14:35,680 --> 03:14:38,720
tasks during the attack so

4598
03:14:38,720 --> 03:14:41,439
um we've seen process hacker be used to

4599
03:14:41,439 --> 03:14:43,040
terminate security agents so like

4600
03:14:43,040 --> 03:14:45,120
antivirus any kind of security products

4601
03:14:45,120 --> 03:14:45,439
and

4602
03:14:45,439 --> 03:14:49,600
things like this also powershell

4603
03:14:49,600 --> 03:14:53,200
and powershell scripts of course to drop

4604
03:14:53,200 --> 03:14:56,080
uh like this cobot strike beacons which

4605
03:14:56,080 --> 03:14:56,800
is actually

4606
03:14:56,800 --> 03:15:00,560
next and uh other kinds of uh

4607
03:15:00,560 --> 03:15:03,279
executables but yeah so the cobblestock

4608
03:15:03,279 --> 03:15:04,160
beacons are the

4609
03:15:04,160 --> 03:15:08,640
the one of the main um

4610
03:15:08,640 --> 03:15:10,160
one of the key components of the

4611
03:15:10,160 --> 03:15:12,800
persistence because uh

4612
03:15:12,800 --> 03:15:16,239
it's it's going to to talk back with uh

4613
03:15:16,239 --> 03:15:18,399
it's like a c2 it's actually called a

4614
03:15:18,399 --> 03:15:20,560
team server in the terminology

4615
03:15:20,560 --> 03:15:24,720
of cobalt strike and well these tools

4616
03:15:24,720 --> 03:15:28,399
as you as you may know they are not

4617
03:15:28,399 --> 03:15:31,359
of course they are not malicious per se

4618
03:15:31,359 --> 03:15:33,040
they are just being used

4619
03:15:33,040 --> 03:15:34,880
with malicious purposes and we

4620
03:15:34,880 --> 03:15:37,359
understand it's not really easy to

4621
03:15:37,359 --> 03:15:40,560
defend against them

4622
03:15:40,560 --> 03:15:43,840
and in case of the cobalt strike they

4623
03:15:43,840 --> 03:15:46,160
they use different types of beacons

4624
03:15:46,160 --> 03:15:47,760
including

4625
03:15:47,760 --> 03:15:50,720
beacons which i particularly find more

4626
03:15:50,720 --> 03:15:52,479
difficult even more difficult to

4627
03:15:52,479 --> 03:15:56,319
to defend against

4628
03:15:56,560 --> 03:15:59,040
yeah then we come to the phase of

4629
03:15:59,040 --> 03:15:59,840
pivoting

4630
03:15:59,840 --> 03:16:02,560
laterally so what they do once they are

4631
03:16:02,560 --> 03:16:03,040
in

4632
03:16:03,040 --> 03:16:05,200
once they are inside the network and

4633
03:16:05,200 --> 03:16:06,319
they've uh

4634
03:16:06,319 --> 03:16:10,720
have persistence already

4635
03:16:10,720 --> 03:16:14,080
done yeah so mimikatz

4636
03:16:14,080 --> 03:16:16,800
for sure it's almost present in you know

4637
03:16:16,800 --> 03:16:17,520
many many

4638
03:16:17,520 --> 03:16:19,840
different attacks or almost all kinds of

4639
03:16:19,840 --> 03:16:21,840
attack that we can

4640
03:16:21,840 --> 03:16:24,960
that we hear of uh

4641
03:16:24,960 --> 03:16:27,120
we've also spotted them exploiting and

4642
03:16:27,120 --> 03:16:28,080
by the way this is

4643
03:16:28,080 --> 03:16:32,000
based on our observation of some

4644
03:16:32,000 --> 03:16:34,080
incident responses that we've conducted

4645
03:16:34,080 --> 03:16:36,000
so

4646
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:38,720
what i'm presenting here to you today is

4647
03:16:38,720 --> 03:16:39,200
really

4648
03:16:39,200 --> 03:16:42,160
based on the real data that we've uh

4649
03:16:42,160 --> 03:16:44,399
we've seen uh

4650
03:16:44,399 --> 03:16:46,239
yeah so this privileged privilege

4651
03:16:46,239 --> 03:16:47,840
escalation vulnerability

4652
03:16:47,840 --> 03:16:51,359
of windows also uh we also spotted that

4653
03:16:51,359 --> 03:16:53,040
being used

4654
03:16:53,040 --> 03:16:57,040
and a small tool called a defined

4655
03:16:57,040 --> 03:17:00,560
just basically enumerate uh

4656
03:17:00,560 --> 03:17:04,319
everything that they can using

4657
03:17:04,319 --> 03:17:07,200
this ad find 2 which connects to the

4658
03:17:07,200 --> 03:17:08,720
active directory and then

4659
03:17:08,720 --> 03:17:12,080
start enumerating things so this is

4660
03:17:12,080 --> 03:17:15,600
uh to move laterally and then

4661
03:17:15,600 --> 03:17:18,720
find the the most

4662
03:17:18,720 --> 03:17:21,680
interesting target which is probably of

4663
03:17:21,680 --> 03:17:22,160
course

4664
03:17:22,160 --> 03:17:25,520
uh the the file server or something you

4665
03:17:25,520 --> 03:17:26,720
know some

4666
03:17:26,720 --> 03:17:29,840
computers that have uh interesting data

4667
03:17:29,840 --> 03:17:32,160
and they look at the data it's not

4668
03:17:32,160 --> 03:17:33,600
really automated

4669
03:17:33,600 --> 03:17:37,279
uh an automated attack so that's why

4670
03:17:37,279 --> 03:17:40,000
also it's a it's very difficult um i

4671
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:41,040
mean it's challenging

4672
03:17:41,040 --> 03:17:45,120
to defend then we come to the

4673
03:17:45,120 --> 03:17:48,960
uh x filtrate part where they actually

4674
03:17:48,960 --> 03:17:52,160
uh steal some data yeah so we've spotted

4675
03:17:52,160 --> 03:17:52,880
them using

4676
03:17:52,880 --> 03:17:55,600
mega sync which is basically like an

4677
03:17:55,600 --> 03:17:56,720
uploader tool

4678
03:17:56,720 --> 03:18:00,160
or a synchronization tool

4679
03:18:00,160 --> 03:18:04,160
of mega dot nz which is a

4680
03:18:04,160 --> 03:18:07,200
sharing file sharing service so they

4681
03:18:07,200 --> 03:18:09,359
they have accounts there and they use

4682
03:18:09,359 --> 03:18:10,960
these accounts

4683
03:18:10,960 --> 03:18:14,239
to receive data from the victims before

4684
03:18:14,239 --> 03:18:16,479
encrypting and that's what we call the

4685
03:18:16,479 --> 03:18:17,359
double

4686
03:18:17,359 --> 03:18:20,720
extortion model

4687
03:18:20,840 --> 03:18:23,680
uh and we also spotted them using

4688
03:18:23,680 --> 03:18:26,720
ftp for this so just uploading data to

4689
03:18:26,720 --> 03:18:27,680
some ftp

4690
03:18:27,680 --> 03:18:30,800
server so this gives us

4691
03:18:30,800 --> 03:18:34,560
actually different intelligence

4692
03:18:34,560 --> 03:18:38,239
on ips and accounts use it with magazine

4693
03:18:38,239 --> 03:18:40,319
so we could collect a lot of interesting

4694
03:18:40,319 --> 03:18:42,640
stuff about this group

4695
03:18:42,640 --> 03:18:44,479
uh talking about a little bit about the

4696
03:18:44,479 --> 03:18:45,680
variants

4697
03:18:45,680 --> 03:18:48,399
we've seen different variants they

4698
03:18:48,399 --> 03:18:50,640
basically keep changing the extension

4699
03:18:50,640 --> 03:18:53,439
and there's also a change on the

4700
03:18:53,439 --> 03:18:54,720
programming language

4701
03:18:54,720 --> 03:18:57,359
used they started with c plus plus which

4702
03:18:57,359 --> 03:18:59,120
is by the way the same language that the

4703
03:18:59,120 --> 03:19:02,319
mt was written and then they changed

4704
03:19:02,319 --> 03:19:05,359
to go and

4705
03:19:05,359 --> 03:19:07,359
after some time they came back to c plus

4706
03:19:07,359 --> 03:19:09,760
plus but then they started doing some

4707
03:19:09,760 --> 03:19:13,279
um other stuff uh in total

4708
03:19:13,279 --> 03:19:14,880
we well this by the way these are the

4709
03:19:14,880 --> 03:19:16,720
extensions that we've seen they

4710
03:19:16,720 --> 03:19:18,960
using but this is this is actually based

4711
03:19:18,960 --> 03:19:20,720
on the the affiliates

4712
03:19:20,720 --> 03:19:23,600
can choose the extension so that's not

4713
03:19:23,600 --> 03:19:24,000
you can

4714
03:19:24,000 --> 03:19:27,920
just trust on the extension uh on

4715
03:19:27,920 --> 03:19:31,520
to do anything and this is really uh

4716
03:19:31,520 --> 03:19:33,200
part of the configuration of the

4717
03:19:33,200 --> 03:19:35,680
wrencher so in total

4718
03:19:35,680 --> 03:19:38,160
we got uh these are unique numbers by

4719
03:19:38,160 --> 03:19:40,399
the way so 77

4720
03:19:40,399 --> 03:19:43,600
different payloads

4721
03:19:43,600 --> 03:19:47,120
and they use 22 different certificates

4722
03:19:47,120 --> 03:19:47,439
so

4723
03:19:47,439 --> 03:19:50,960
the banners are signed and

4724
03:19:50,960 --> 03:19:54,800
43 different public keys rsa public keys

4725
03:19:54,800 --> 03:19:56,000
this is to encrypt

4726
03:19:56,000 --> 03:19:59,760
the generated aes case

4727
03:19:59,760 --> 03:20:02,160
that encrypt each file so which file has

4728
03:20:02,160 --> 03:20:03,120
its own

4729
03:20:03,120 --> 03:20:06,560
aes random

4730
03:20:06,560 --> 03:20:09,279
key that is generated and this key is

4731
03:20:09,279 --> 03:20:10,800
encrypted by

4732
03:20:10,800 --> 03:20:14,720
the rsa public key we believe that the

4733
03:20:14,720 --> 03:20:17,520
rsa public key is based on the number of

4734
03:20:17,520 --> 03:20:18,080
uh

4735
03:20:18,080 --> 03:20:20,399
campaigns that we could be also taking

4736
03:20:20,399 --> 03:20:23,040
as the number of uh

4737
03:20:23,040 --> 03:20:25,279
yeah campaigns started by the affiliates

4738
03:20:25,279 --> 03:20:26,800
so if you have a

4739
03:20:26,800 --> 03:20:29,760
rsa public key then that means you have

4740
03:20:29,760 --> 03:20:30,960
a campaign

4741
03:20:30,960 --> 03:20:34,319
and then with 43 different ones

4742
03:20:34,319 --> 03:20:37,600
unique ones that would mean 43

4743
03:20:37,600 --> 03:20:39,680
different campaigns but maybe they are

4744
03:20:39,680 --> 03:20:41,040
from the same affiliates

4745
03:20:41,040 --> 03:20:43,920
right so um i'm not saying that there

4746
03:20:43,920 --> 03:20:44,160
are

4747
03:20:44,160 --> 03:20:47,200
43 affiliates out there

4748
03:20:47,200 --> 03:20:50,239
okay yeah so yeah the impact i've

4749
03:20:50,239 --> 03:20:51,920
talked a little bit already about this

4750
03:20:51,920 --> 03:20:53,760
uh we have this plus plus and go

4751
03:20:53,760 --> 03:20:54,399
versions

4752
03:20:54,399 --> 03:20:57,920
the aes encryption

4753
03:20:57,920 --> 03:21:01,200
uh used for encrypting the files and

4754
03:21:01,200 --> 03:21:04,399
by the way this is uh after the process

4755
03:21:04,399 --> 03:21:07,439
of exfiltration of stealing the data

4756
03:21:07,439 --> 03:21:10,479
because they're gonna are going to try

4757
03:21:10,479 --> 03:21:13,840
to do some extortion again with the data

4758
03:21:13,840 --> 03:21:16,160
in case the victim doesn't pay which is

4759
03:21:16,160 --> 03:21:17,200
very common

4760
03:21:17,200 --> 03:21:20,880
um currently right uh they have

4761
03:21:20,880 --> 03:21:23,120
json based configuration in the most

4762
03:21:23,120 --> 03:21:24,880
recent versions

4763
03:21:24,880 --> 03:21:26,880
and some different operational modes

4764
03:21:26,880 --> 03:21:28,800
this is what are called operation

4765
03:21:28,800 --> 03:21:31,520
modes basically uh with the ransom

4766
03:21:31,520 --> 03:21:33,359
payloads you can encrypt

4767
03:21:33,359 --> 03:21:34,880
the attacker the affiliates can encrypt

4768
03:21:34,880 --> 03:21:37,200
a single directory probably used for

4769
03:21:37,200 --> 03:21:39,600
i don't know testing purposes or a very

4770
03:21:39,600 --> 03:21:40,560
specific

4771
03:21:40,560 --> 03:21:42,800
uh type of attack once they are in the

4772
03:21:42,800 --> 03:21:44,960
network they can choose a directory and

4773
03:21:44,960 --> 03:21:47,439
start encrypting or they can just run

4774
03:21:47,439 --> 03:21:48,479
the render

4775
03:21:48,479 --> 03:21:51,600
payload and encrypt all drives and as i

4776
03:21:51,600 --> 03:21:52,000
said

4777
03:21:52,000 --> 03:21:55,600
this is uh the way the eraser is going

4778
03:21:55,600 --> 03:21:56,319
to behave

4779
03:21:56,319 --> 03:21:59,840
is actually configured by a json

4780
03:21:59,840 --> 03:22:03,200
file so uh that's really

4781
03:22:03,200 --> 03:22:07,120
really ready to be used by affiliates

4782
03:22:07,120 --> 03:22:11,840
that's a dendrogram of the current 7

4783
03:22:11,840 --> 03:22:12,399
samples

4784
03:22:12,399 --> 03:22:16,000
that we have in for nephilim

4785
03:22:16,000 --> 03:22:19,279
and it specifies actually

4786
03:22:19,279 --> 03:22:22,160
how similar they are this is using tlsh

4787
03:22:22,160 --> 03:22:23,920
it's a similarity

4788
03:22:23,920 --> 03:22:25,920
it's a locally sensitive algorithm that

4789
03:22:25,920 --> 03:22:27,920
we've developed in trend

4790
03:22:27,920 --> 03:22:30,319
so uh we can say that we can see that

4791
03:22:30,319 --> 03:22:30,960
there are

4792
03:22:30,960 --> 03:22:33,359
mainly true groups and these two groups

4793
03:22:33,359 --> 03:22:35,200
are actually the ones because this is

4794
03:22:35,200 --> 03:22:35,840
based on

4795
03:22:35,840 --> 03:22:38,960
file structure so uh the c plus plus

4796
03:22:38,960 --> 03:22:41,200
uh compiled binaries and the gold

4797
03:22:41,200 --> 03:22:42,399
compiled variance would

4798
03:22:42,399 --> 03:22:45,200
of course look very different but then

4799
03:22:45,200 --> 03:22:46,880
we can start grouping

4800
03:22:46,880 --> 03:22:50,239
uh by the the characteristics of

4801
03:22:50,239 --> 03:22:52,720
the uh evolution and this dendrogram

4802
03:22:52,720 --> 03:22:54,640
helped us to understand how many

4803
03:22:54,640 --> 03:22:58,239
variants of naflin rensser exist out

4804
03:22:58,239 --> 03:22:58,960
there

4805
03:22:58,960 --> 03:23:03,839
and how they uh evolved

4806
03:23:04,800 --> 03:23:07,920
okay so uh for the ransom they use

4807
03:23:07,920 --> 03:23:11,600
uh different uh contacting emails

4808
03:23:11,600 --> 03:23:14,640
that they put in rental notes

4809
03:23:14,640 --> 03:23:16,800
we've seen a lot of them using like

4810
03:23:16,800 --> 03:23:18,800
protonmail into tanota for

4811
03:23:18,800 --> 03:23:21,359
obvious reasons of uh you know so law

4812
03:23:21,359 --> 03:23:22,080
enforcement

4813
03:23:22,080 --> 03:23:24,720
really can you know have a hard time

4814
03:23:24,720 --> 03:23:25,520
trying to

4815
03:23:25,520 --> 03:23:29,920
to break into the security of this

4816
03:23:29,920 --> 03:23:31,920
but we also spotted some affiliates

4817
03:23:31,920 --> 03:23:33,680
being probably

4818
03:23:33,680 --> 03:23:36,640
on carlton using mayo.com and even

4819
03:23:36,640 --> 03:23:37,760
icloud

4820
03:23:37,760 --> 03:23:40,800
so that it also gave us many

4821
03:23:40,800 --> 03:23:44,479
um interesting data

4822
03:23:44,479 --> 03:23:47,119
about them

4823
03:23:48,560 --> 03:23:52,399
the cnc in the leakage blog we've

4824
03:23:52,399 --> 03:23:55,600
identified some actually first the team

4825
03:23:55,600 --> 03:23:57,680
servers of global strike that this group

4826
03:23:57,680 --> 03:23:58,800
use

4827
03:23:58,800 --> 03:24:01,040
so with some high confidence uh we've

4828
03:24:01,040 --> 03:24:02,000
seen uh

4829
03:24:02,000 --> 03:24:04,720
team servers in netherlands we can take

4830
03:24:04,720 --> 03:24:06,000
it as a cnc

4831
03:24:06,000 --> 03:24:08,160
of the rancher but in fact it's just the

4832
03:24:08,160 --> 03:24:10,080
team server that the kobo strike beacon

4833
03:24:10,080 --> 03:24:10,840
connects

4834
03:24:10,840 --> 03:24:14,960
to and in sweden bulgaria france romania

4835
03:24:14,960 --> 03:24:16,160
uk

4836
03:24:16,160 --> 03:24:18,960
they are all uh behind what we would

4837
03:24:18,960 --> 03:24:19,520
call

4838
03:24:19,520 --> 03:24:22,560
bulletproof hosting uh providers but

4839
03:24:22,560 --> 03:24:23,359
we've

4840
03:24:23,359 --> 03:24:27,040
identified all these servers

4841
03:24:27,040 --> 03:24:29,439
and with some medium confidence also one

4842
03:24:29,439 --> 03:24:30,880
server in the

4843
03:24:30,880 --> 03:24:35,200
u.s this is the leakage block that they

4844
03:24:35,200 --> 03:24:36,399
use

4845
03:24:36,399 --> 03:24:40,080
it's behind a flash fast floods network

4846
03:24:40,080 --> 03:24:41,840
that's the same model as name team by

4847
03:24:41,840 --> 03:24:43,520
the way and there's also a version

4848
03:24:43,520 --> 03:24:46,160
behind an onion domain

4849
03:24:46,160 --> 03:24:49,760
that we believe we've identified the

4850
03:24:49,760 --> 03:24:53,120
ib address of this we have more details

4851
03:24:53,120 --> 03:24:55,040
in the paper

4852
03:24:55,040 --> 03:24:58,000
so yeah uh on the partnerships one thing

4853
03:24:58,000 --> 03:24:59,279
one interesting thing is

4854
03:24:59,279 --> 03:25:03,359
um we've seen that the the an empty

4855
03:25:03,359 --> 03:25:05,359
greenswear not netherling but namti

4856
03:25:05,359 --> 03:25:06,720
rancher

4857
03:25:06,720 --> 03:25:09,920
because they it has a it had a c2

4858
03:25:09,920 --> 03:25:14,399
uh and dc2 uh was um

4859
03:25:14,399 --> 03:25:17,120
they shared infrastructure with the the

4860
03:25:17,120 --> 03:25:18,319
same

4861
03:25:18,319 --> 03:25:21,040
infrastructure from these guys uh which

4862
03:25:21,040 --> 03:25:22,000
is a

4863
03:25:22,000 --> 03:25:25,520
shop in the in dark web i'd say

4864
03:25:25,520 --> 03:25:28,720
so it's a tour it's a that onion uh

4865
03:25:28,720 --> 03:25:31,040
shop for any kind of malicious and

4866
03:25:31,040 --> 03:25:32,479
illegal stuff

4867
03:25:32,479 --> 03:25:34,160
so they've shared some infrastructure

4868
03:25:34,160 --> 03:25:36,160
for more than a year

4869
03:25:36,160 --> 03:25:40,160
and so there may be some connection here

4870
03:25:40,160 --> 03:25:43,680
um yeah so recommendations

4871
03:25:43,680 --> 03:25:47,040
um again this is

4872
03:25:47,040 --> 03:25:49,680
uh that's almost an apt-level attack i

4873
03:25:49,680 --> 03:25:50,479
would say

4874
03:25:50,479 --> 03:25:53,920
so they are organized they um leak

4875
03:25:53,920 --> 03:25:57,439
the data in a very uh organized way

4876
03:25:57,439 --> 03:26:00,239
and uh actually in our paper we

4877
03:26:00,239 --> 03:26:01,920
described as

4878
03:26:01,920 --> 03:26:04,160
we because we've been checking the data

4879
03:26:04,160 --> 03:26:06,399
and if the data is online

4880
03:26:06,399 --> 03:26:08,080
and they are very good actually at

4881
03:26:08,080 --> 03:26:10,560
keeping the data the the stolen data

4882
03:26:10,560 --> 03:26:12,560
online for downloading

4883
03:26:12,560 --> 03:26:16,160
and trying to convince um the victims to

4884
03:26:16,160 --> 03:26:17,359
pay

4885
03:26:17,359 --> 03:26:20,399
uh yeah so once they are in they study

4886
03:26:20,399 --> 03:26:22,479
the the targets network we had a case

4887
03:26:22,479 --> 03:26:24,640
for instance where they've

4888
03:26:24,640 --> 03:26:27,600
tried to deploy a cable strike beacon

4889
03:26:27,600 --> 03:26:28,800
and they didn't work because the

4890
03:26:28,800 --> 03:26:29,680
security

4891
03:26:29,680 --> 03:26:32,399
agent caught that and then they came

4892
03:26:32,399 --> 03:26:32,960
back

4893
03:26:32,960 --> 03:26:36,560
uh after several days with a signed

4894
03:26:36,560 --> 03:26:40,399
uh beacon and try again so uh they are

4895
03:26:40,399 --> 03:26:41,200
persistent

4896
03:26:41,200 --> 03:26:44,319
uh it's like uh sometimes i was uh you

4897
03:26:44,319 --> 03:26:44,640
know

4898
03:26:44,640 --> 03:26:47,120
just joking with uh my colleagues and

4899
03:26:47,120 --> 03:26:47,680
say that

4900
03:26:47,680 --> 03:26:50,319
that's like a pen test but uh well the

4901
03:26:50,319 --> 03:26:52,000
difference is that they have

4902
03:26:52,000 --> 03:26:54,160
uh all the time they want and they they

4903
03:26:54,160 --> 03:26:55,040
don't need

4904
03:26:55,040 --> 03:26:56,479
they don't have any scope they can do

4905
03:26:56,479 --> 03:26:58,479
whatever they want so it's really

4906
03:26:58,479 --> 03:27:01,600
uh challenging to to defend

4907
03:27:01,600 --> 03:27:04,399
well they did not victimize any

4908
03:27:04,399 --> 03:27:06,560
countries in the cis

4909
03:27:06,560 --> 03:27:08,880
and they've been active for at least two

4910
03:27:08,880 --> 03:27:09,760
years

4911
03:27:09,760 --> 03:27:14,160
so the model of affiliate programs

4912
03:27:14,160 --> 03:27:16,160
make the the key chains to look

4913
03:27:16,160 --> 03:27:17,600
different so one attack

4914
03:27:17,600 --> 03:27:20,399
can kill chain of one victim can be very

4915
03:27:20,399 --> 03:27:22,160
different from the other one

4916
03:27:22,160 --> 03:27:24,160
because different affiliates may have

4917
03:27:24,160 --> 03:27:25,680
may use different tools

4918
03:27:25,680 --> 03:27:28,080
so that's also something to consider

4919
03:27:28,080 --> 03:27:31,520
when you are defending against it

4920
03:27:31,520 --> 03:27:35,359
i would say that uh we have to be very

4921
03:27:35,359 --> 03:27:38,160
careful when exposing things like rdp

4922
03:27:38,160 --> 03:27:41,040
and you know unpatched stuff and i know

4923
03:27:41,040 --> 03:27:42,880
that these messages have been given like

4924
03:27:42,880 --> 03:27:43,600
uh

4925
03:27:43,600 --> 03:27:46,720
every uh all over um

4926
03:27:46,720 --> 03:27:50,000
from time to time everybody talks about

4927
03:27:50,000 --> 03:27:50,399
this

4928
03:27:50,399 --> 03:27:51,760
but that's really important because

4929
03:27:51,760 --> 03:27:53,840
that's literally the way

4930
03:27:53,840 --> 03:27:56,720
they they get in like and though and

4931
03:27:56,720 --> 03:27:57,200
also

4932
03:27:57,200 --> 03:27:59,359
there's hacking tools or six admin or

4933
03:27:59,359 --> 03:28:01,120
network admin tools

4934
03:28:01,120 --> 03:28:05,439
um the policies uh for them should be

4935
03:28:05,439 --> 03:28:09,279
very strict i would say in our report we

4936
03:28:09,279 --> 03:28:10,239
have uh

4937
03:28:10,239 --> 03:28:13,359
a full set of attribution uh well

4938
03:28:13,359 --> 03:28:16,720
data not like that we've attributed uh

4939
03:28:16,720 --> 03:28:19,279
who the real people are but uh there is

4940
03:28:19,279 --> 03:28:21,120
more information about this that

4941
03:28:21,120 --> 03:28:24,960
you may want to look at

4942
03:28:24,960 --> 03:28:27,840
there is also the ttps that we've mapped

4943
03:28:27,840 --> 03:28:28,880
using the mitre

4944
03:28:28,880 --> 03:28:31,279
attack framework and the full set of

4945
03:28:31,279 --> 03:28:33,439
iocs including all the rsa

4946
03:28:33,439 --> 03:28:37,200
keys all the certificates

4947
03:28:37,200 --> 03:28:39,200
and the family prints the hashes and

4948
03:28:39,200 --> 03:28:40,479
everything else so

4949
03:28:40,479 --> 03:28:44,080
and uh many more details on the network

4950
03:28:44,080 --> 03:28:46,640
infrastructure of the cobo strike team

4951
03:28:46,640 --> 03:28:47,279
servers

4952
03:28:47,279 --> 03:28:51,040
and also the leakage blog

4953
03:28:51,040 --> 03:28:53,359
so yeah if this i conclude with a final

4954
03:28:53,359 --> 03:28:54,560
message

4955
03:28:54,560 --> 03:28:58,399
this um defending against

4956
03:28:58,399 --> 03:29:00,640
ransomware is actually uh i would say

4957
03:29:00,640 --> 03:29:02,399
it's a lost battle

4958
03:29:02,399 --> 03:29:04,319
we are actually defending against the

4959
03:29:04,319 --> 03:29:07,359
affiliates which are we can say

4960
03:29:07,359 --> 03:29:09,840
hacking groups so uh if you are trying

4961
03:29:09,840 --> 03:29:11,840
to defend against rinser

4962
03:29:11,840 --> 03:29:15,359
it's really uh not the way to go

4963
03:29:15,359 --> 03:29:18,479
we have to defend against a

4964
03:29:18,479 --> 03:29:21,279
hacking group a whole hacking group that

4965
03:29:21,279 --> 03:29:22,479
is going to use

4966
03:29:22,479 --> 03:29:24,880
different tools to attack your network

4967
03:29:24,880 --> 03:29:26,319
and uh one of them

4968
03:29:26,319 --> 03:29:29,200
is ransomware but um you know the data

4969
03:29:29,200 --> 03:29:30,399
is stolen so that

4970
03:29:30,399 --> 03:29:33,680
any many other states that you can be

4971
03:29:33,680 --> 03:29:35,120
victimized and

4972
03:29:35,120 --> 03:29:38,080
that needs our attention with this i

4973
03:29:38,080 --> 03:29:39,920
conclude my presentation i will be

4974
03:29:39,920 --> 03:29:40,720
around for

4975
03:29:40,720 --> 03:29:43,840
