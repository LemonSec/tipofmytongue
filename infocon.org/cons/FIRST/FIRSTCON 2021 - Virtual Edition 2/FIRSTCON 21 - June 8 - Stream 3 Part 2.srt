00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,360
all right

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,600
i will hand it over now to shin a dot

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,400
she shouldn't take it away

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,440
yes thank you and hi everybody uh this

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:11,679
is

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,880
shin uh that's you with nd dessert and

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,680
i'll be moderating this session today

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,279
one item before we get started

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,800
we will be holding q a immediately

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,279
following this presentation

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,120
in work adventure the virtual social

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,120
platform

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,760
this is the same place you can find our

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,800
exhibitors

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,960
and other fun activities

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,520
and with that let's get let's get

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,200
started

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,399
it is my great pleasure to introduce to

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,719
the today's presenter

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,760
the again he's speaking again

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,039
the uh it's great um master

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,600
alexander duranoy

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,960
he is a core member of various open

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,320
source projects

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,320
such as miss ail project

26
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,000
or d4 project working for

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
computer instant response central

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,360
luxembourg

29
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,479
or as known as circle

30
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,759
ah alexandra stage is yours

31
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,320
thank you sean thank you very much and

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,240
welcome to everyone uh

33
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,320
it's a great pleasure for me to be to be

34
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,360
here today and

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,320
to talk about a specific picture that we

36
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,720
we enjoy at

37
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,439
so first of all i will um talk about

38
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,560
something that

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,360
we have to do as a css and the thing

40
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,799
that we i'm talking about

41
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,200
today will be about scanning

42
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,720
internet-wise scanning

43
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,960
and the different thing that as

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,640
associates we have to do but

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,680
we are facing some challenges and one of

46
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,520
the first challenges and if you are

47
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,280
operating assessor

48
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,159
when you have to scan for or find a

49
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,600
specific vulnerability

50
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,199
in your infrastructure or in your

51
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,878
constituents

52
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,040
you usually rely on on scanning from

53
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,400
third parties

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,000
and sometimes it's difficult for you to

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,040
find out okay at which level the scan is

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,640
do we have the latest data of the scan

57
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,560
and so on so it's one of the issue

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,000
one of the most common issue i mean for

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,599
the this year

60
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,599
another issue that we have uh as

61
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,640
associated

62
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,040
sometimes the scanning is incomplete or

63
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,440
localized in a different country

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,280
even if for example services in your

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,120
constituency so

66
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,519
it's very common for scanning services

67
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,160
for example to wrongly assign

68
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,640
the locations of the scanning network

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,800
and so on

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,480
another thing is if you want to uh

71
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,000
quickly find out new vulnerable machines

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,239
devices in your infrastructure or the

73
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,040
constituent

74
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,280
country or and stuff like that it's

75
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,720
becoming more and more difficult because

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:00,959
you

77
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,920
you have to to find and to do the

78
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,280
complete ipv4

79
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,519
address space uh scanning so it might

80
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,040
take time and so on so

81
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,959
those kind of of things becoming more

82
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,239
and more difficult another thing that is

83
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,680
really difficult too is

84
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,360
a lot of scanning for example is based

85
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,720
on my plc but

86
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
nowadays a lot of services are based on

87
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,080
name so that means for

88
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,840
when you do a scanning on my places you

89
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,680
are missing a lot of servicing your

90
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,760
potential vulnerable device too

91
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,480
because for example on tls you have sni

92
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,760
meaning that you have name-based

93
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,200
services so you need to

94
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,959
scan with those names and not with the

95
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,360
ipads to discover those ones

96
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,200
another thing that is tough is to

97
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,720
discover really

98
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,280
actively active and newly exposed

99
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,159
devices

100
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,000
that you can cannot find quickly if you

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
do kind of exhaustive search on all the

102
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,440
ips for space or you can

103
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,400
cannot even find the ipv6 space so today

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,760
what i want to do

105
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,200
with you is really to discuss strategies

106
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,920
on how to improve that and really the

107
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,879
thing that we

108
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,640
i want to show to you is basically to

109
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
summarize the technique that we

110
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,680
discovered that we test it we try

111
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,080
a circle and that we are now nowadays

112
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,200
using

113
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,560
to find out those renewable machines

114
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,799
i will mention some of the techniques

115
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,120
their advantages disadvantages because

116
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,798
you know not everything is coming with

117
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,279
like perfect solutions but sometimes you

118
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,280
have to find a right balance between

119
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,320
filing quickly devices uh and for

120
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,680
example

121
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,360
less resources to be used when doing the

122
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,040
scanning and so on

123
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,720
so obviously the technique i will

124
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,040
mention today are not an exhaustive list

125
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,520
of all the techniques available

126
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,440
but i will cover the most with

127
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,800
applicable strategies for

128
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,840
cesar without going into

129
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,720
complex or at least pretty large

130
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,080
solutions

131
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,600
so to give you a quick overview of what

132
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,520
we will discuss is

133
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,720
the different techniques that we will

134
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,320
show today are basically different ones

135
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,000
so it's not a single one and you will

136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,600
see that those different techniques

137
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,479
are interlinked between each other so i

138
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,479
will talk about certificate transparency

139
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,919
which is a source of data sort of

140
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,919
information that you can use for

141
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,320
finding vulnerable machines i will talk

142
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,919
about for example passive dns data

143
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,039
stream

144
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,880
and specific techniques that you can or

145
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,960
even trick that you can use to find out

146
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,919
that

147
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,160
you'll see that some of the tricks that

148
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,479
we we are using to find out

149
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,960
and and scan some new networks and so on

150
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,160
are always

151
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,000
going back to specific techniques and on

152
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,080
this diagram and the

153
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,240
the site are available and shared with

154
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,280
everyone

155
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,120
you'll see that for example one of the

156
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,560
techniques which is uh

157
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,160
basically the breed forcing of dns

158
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,160
records and so on is a record

159
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,440
i would say a kind of recursive

160
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,199
technique that is used in in all the

161
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,479
different places

162
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,720
so usually what you you will see for

163
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,160
scanning it's a combination

164
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,759
of all those different techniques to

165
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,319
dagger together to find out

166
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,680
vulnerable devices uh new ipvc flanges

167
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,160
new fpg6 addresses and so on by using

168
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
those different techniques

169
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,000
so the first one i want to to talk to

170
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,840
you and i think this one is maybe

171
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,639
familiar

172
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,160
for for you it is a certificate

173
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,639
transparency so uh the majority of

174
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,240
certificate authority nowadays are

175
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,360
publishing

176
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,680
a kind of off of lockbook and this

177
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,400
logbook

178
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,199
contains a continuous stream of all the

179
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:21,840
logs

180
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,639
from the certificate being signed and so

181
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,319
on which is a very interesting sources

182
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,759
of information

183
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,199
a lot of people for example are using

184
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,600
that for discovering fishing

185
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,759
a new website of fishing and so on in

186
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,800
our case here

187
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,039
we will use it as a source of

188
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:37,919
information

189
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,960
to potentially scan new and discover new

190
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,919
services

191
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,800
uh to be scanned first that's and i

192
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
think this one is quite important

193
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,400
when you you get access to certificate

194
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,080
transparency list you have different

195
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,599
open source tools where you can

196
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,599
uh basically get such kind of

197
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,199
information you have even public

198
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,560
accessible services for dialogue books

199
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,759
thing that you have to do is basically

200
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,759
to extract these 509 certificates so

201
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,880
those certificates

202
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,199
are published in their format in the

203
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,680
certificate transparency

204
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,680
and what we are doing for finding new

205
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,800
services

206
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,440
and to for example feed or scanning

207
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,479
mechanism

208
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,319
we are extracting all the subject and

209
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,759
name from the certificate

210
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
so it means that all the requirements

211
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,720
are used for the certificate

212
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,120
and what we do we basically brute force

213
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,479
and we resolve

214
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,000
all the records so the a record

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
the casual player record to find the apc

216
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,319
constructed the rfc and the ipv4

217
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,280
associated to those subjectile names for

218
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,080
each of the hostnames so we do that

219
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,479
what we do too is automatically when we

220
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,160
record and get that recurrence we have

221
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,520
this ip

222
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,039
we store it in a kind of lasting

223
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,879
database so for us

224
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,960
it's i think quite efficient because a

225
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,479
lot of

226
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,479
recurring lookup is giving you some

227
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,560
accuracy so you don't want to scan again

228
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,039
the semiconductor so you have to

229
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,160
differentiate ipraciata newly discovered

230
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,840
from the one that has already been seen

231
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,080
so we have a kind of off of quick

232
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,240
lookup on that if you are interested or

233
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,080
how we are doing it even the script

234
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
that we use for doing that it's part of

235
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,360
one of our projects

236
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,479
uh it's called ct scotianize uh where we

237
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:16,960
have a

238
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,360
dns resolver python script which is

239
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,479
basically doing the

240
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,720
uh the resolving of those things and

241
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,879
then we see those new iprf to the

242
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,680
scanner and the scanner webcam

243
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,960
there are some drawbacks to this

244
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,520
solution and something to keep in mind

245
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,440
when you do such kind of things when you

246
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,799
have a certificate of

247
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,559
transparency issues when you have a

248
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,839
certificate issue

249
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,519
it doesn't mean that the final services

250
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,279
is already set up and running

251
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,200
on the remote house so you have to keep

252
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,680
that in mind for your scanner activity

253
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,600
so that means you have to keep back

254
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,279
those kind of appearances for a specific

255
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,000
period of time

256
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,959
and hit high multiple times some time to

257
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,480
access so we are what you have seen is

258
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
uh usually in a period of like 48 hours

259
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,519
72 hours

260
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,880
you might have different services

261
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,040
popping up on the machines um after

262
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,320
subscription has been set up

263
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,920
which makes sense because system and

264
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,160
setup usually set up a cell certificate

265
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,200
and then later on

266
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,120
they give to a certain parties and

267
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,200
organizations another team someone else

268
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,160
is doing the

269
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,720
the setup and they are providing this

270
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,600
kind of

271
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,000
things so you see that this application

272
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,200
is one of the

273
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,519
interesting sources of information so

274
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,120
for your scanner so you can really break

275
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,720
force all the a and tell the player

276
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,880
record to get ipv4 and ipv6 address

277
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,680
space

278
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,560
to scan and find quickly potentially

279
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,600
venerable machines on on the internet

280
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,760
another thing that is interesting too is

281
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,640
when you you

282
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,720
you extract those kind of uh hostname

283
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,320
and domain and resolution that you have

284
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,800
from

285
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,440
particular transparency you might do an

286
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,200
additional step and this one is

287
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,160
is a step that is done very often in

288
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,959
finding

289
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,320
actively uh new us and so on is to

290
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,040
basically brute force the austen so how

291
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,399
does it work

292
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,560
is very straightforward so we will

293
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,480
happen to specific domain names

294
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,079
specifically and some additional

295
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,360
hostname

296
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,880
that could be resolvable so for for

297
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,839
doing that you have

298
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,560
different strategies um i mean for for

299
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,839
what we do on our site

300
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,399
it's very simple we have kind of of top

301
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,440
20

302
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,040
uh of them that we use for example www

303
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,760
is one

304
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,399
male surfer and others are used and then

305
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:22,959
you can

306
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,640
automatically find out additional

307
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,240
machines that

308
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,839
are maybe on the same domain and so on

309
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,680
be very careful because the brute force

310
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,200
activity is when you are brute forcing

311
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,800
dns it can be slow so

312
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,200
if you enumerate for example a complete

313
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,040
dictionary which is pretty large

314
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
uh it might take a lot of time so

315
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,320
usually you have to find the right

316
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,600
balance between

317
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,800
the brute forcing of the dnf versus the

318
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,760
time that you have to

319
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,240
have the answer so um what we do usually

320
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,000
for having a very quick resolution is to

321
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,720
have a

322
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,279
top 20. so we have a top 20 of of domain

323
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,480
names with those kind of

324
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,880
additional us that we append to the

325
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,000
domain names

326
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,279
and those one are the most commonly used

327
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,240
that you have seen for example in the

328
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,360
passive dns

329
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,440
we might have a regional one because in

330
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,640
some countries you might have for

331
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,360
example

332
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,399
a server express in french for example

333
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,079
or server expressed in english for

334
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,680
example in different countries so

335
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,160
depending on the country you are in you

336
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,200
might have a different

337
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
way of doing that but sometimes you want

338
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,120
to go a bit further so you want to bring

339
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,519
forth

340
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,560
much more costs but you still want to

341
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,959
have a kind of efficient space for that

342
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,040
so some years ago we did work with

343
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,720
another university on that

344
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,880
and we have an advanced technique called

345
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,519
dns brute force which is dbf and we're

346
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,360
using the markov chain models for that

347
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,000
and to recover

348
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,600
additional understanding so it's one

349
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,839
strategy uh again this kind of breathe

350
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,399
forcing a boston is really a key element

351
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,320
in your chain of of discovering

352
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,519
potential ui parents

353
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,519
and so on because you have sometimes

354
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,200
just a new domain and you have to brute

355
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,399
force the associated

356
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,800
postname for that specific domain so

357
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,639
that's one one one common way of doing

358
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,519
it

359
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,800
so the thing is when you um

360
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,800
find uh specific ipv6 analysis

361
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
you get an additional information so if

362
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,040
you know that a specific risk address is

363
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,279
used it means that the ipv6 associated

364
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,160
subnet

365
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,320
is active because this one is routable

366
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
accessible to those parties and so on

367
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,519
so what you can do there you can do get

368
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,920
an additional brute forcing on the ipv6

369
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,320
because

370
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,959
the ap ip6 space is pretty large but if

371
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,399
you end up with having

372
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,560
just a subnet that you know that is

373
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,000
already used because you've got an ipad

374
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,639
office

375
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,279
in that subnet you can do what we call

376
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,959
bridge forcing of the ipv6 manual

377
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,839
locations

378
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,279
so it means that you will use some

379
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,120
specific click to discover

380
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,079
those ipv6 rfc one of the most commonly

381
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:46,880
uh trick is

382
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,000
to use the compressed ipv6 address

383
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,959
because

384
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,800
when alice is pretty large it's

385
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,560
difficult to remember those but a lot of

386
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,639
operators are setting up water

387
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,959
infrastructure sparking infrastructures

388
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,519
on very compressed ipv6 so that means if

389
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,800
you get a subnet

390
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,000
just write the first entries on

391
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,880
those kind of subnets and you'll get

392
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,360
some

393
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,279
response so usually it's like even

394
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,600
between 10 or 20 percent so it's quite

395
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,399
quite important additional one is if you

396
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,160
have manual allocations usually the

397
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,639
human

398
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,399
setting up the education so that means

399
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,000
they are using

400
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,079
a specific x-block for example like the

401
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,839
decimal block that they can remember

402
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,760
and it's not uncommon to see for example

403
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,519
blocks like death beef

404
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,040
abba cafe caterpillar f and stuff like

405
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,600
that

406
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,040
because those ones are easy to remember

407
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,560
and you have for example subnets where

408
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,440
you have like

409
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,560
that four times um in the exactly small

410
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,000
representation of the address so

411
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,440
you can just breathe for that to

412
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,120
discover additional therapy another

413
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,480
thing that we have seen and this one is

414
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,920
pretty common

415
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,240
some of the final part of the ips

416
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,040
address

417
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,120
contains the service itself so that

418
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,040
means the tcp or udp

419
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,480
port associated to the specific services

420
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,040
so

421
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,519
it's a very easy way to reforce manual

422
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,959
locations

423
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,880
nevertheless manual location is just a

424
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,959
part of the ipv6

425
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,760
address space and the thing is you have

426
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,399
a lot of

427
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,920
randomized ipv6 address

428
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,839
which is something quite nice because it

429
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,279
means that it's difficult to

430
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,760
track down user and so on but for

431
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,480
scanning it's

432
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,440
becoming difficult too um on the screen

433
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,199
that you can see now it's it's a

434
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,800
result of just an extraction for the ipv

435
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,839
currency currencies i've seen on the

436
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,680
circularly website

437
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,440
and it's just to give you an idea of how

438
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,639
many ipv6 are randomized nowadays

439
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,600
and you see that around 85 percent of

440
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,279
the ipvc currencies

441
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,600
are reaching out the circular edge

442
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,440
website on one day

443
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,040
are randomized so it's quite a

444
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,120
significant number so it's not like

445
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,199
uh a small percentage so that means a

446
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,519
lot of those ipv6 are from the mine

447
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,760
so meaning that if you want to scan

448
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,880
those

449
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,680
good luck it's much more difficult

450
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,199
nevertheless you can see that you still

451
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:01,920
have some

452
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,120
lower percentage of ipv6 there which are

453
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,880
what we call low bytes

454
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,480
things like for example crawlers and

455
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,279
things like that are using those kind of

456
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,199
activities because they are manually

457
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,480
allocated

458
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,240
so that means those ones are easy to

459
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,160
scan or discover so it's again a nice

460
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,440
data set to discover

461
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,959
which one you need to scan nevertheless

462
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,720
there is something interesting here i

463
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,639
was using basically the

464
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,279
lock entries of my web server to find

465
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,399
out those randomized ips ipv6

466
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,639
so it might give an idea then for you if

467
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,480
you might give an idea or to collect

468
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,560
those randomized pvc cameras

469
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,279
if you have a public web services it's a

470
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,160
nice way

471
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,560
to basically get all those ipv6

472
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,079
addresses to scanner

473
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,839
and that's another trick that you can

474
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,279
you can do some

475
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,759
uh security operators are running public

476
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,480
services

477
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,040
web services even network services for

478
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,600
example

479
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,120
dns ntp services stun whatever

480
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,720
and they are using that as a source of

481
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,720
scanning so it's not uncommon sometimes

482
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,079
when you reach all the public services

483
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,680
you are scanned back

484
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,839
and that's one of the effects so it's

485
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,399
another way to find out new ipvc series

486
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,639
that you can use for scanning new one

487
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,240
that has been set up

488
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,880
they follow the trick for example and

489
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,800
some are doing that

490
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,519
they are using victor on trackers so as

491
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,480
you know

492
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,800
others it works for victorian when you

493
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,600
are

494
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,120
a victorian client you need to connect

495
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,680
to a tracker to basically set with

496
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,759
to the swarm of of cayenne that you have

497
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,759
such kind of blocks there

498
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,759
but in the bittorrent protocol you have

499
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,360
what we call the get peer request

500
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,440
so that means if you connect to a

501
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,120
specific torrent that are

502
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,199
in the tracker you can ask for all the

503
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,320
ipv6

504
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,920
addresses that you you get so you have

505
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,480
this what's called n6 request

506
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,959
so it was introduced some years ago but

507
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,519
it's giving all backfield vitv6 so it's

508
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,199
another way to scan at least

509
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,120
because those are active functionality

510
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,399
and are even used to

511
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,560
see the torrent currently so it's one

512
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,480
way of getting information

513
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,160
and you see that such kind of things is

514
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,760
i think easy to set up

515
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,799
uh there is no big deal with that one um

516
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,640
and if you want to have a source of

517
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,880
randomized ipv6

518
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,240
it's one way to do it if you're

519
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,760
interested in the topic of the

520
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,119
bittorrent tracker there's a very good

521
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,839
paper on the uh

522
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,760
on university in uk and this stasis is

523
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,520
about a list of bunches attacks in

524
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,439
big transform it's giving a lot of

525
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,960
details about the protocol and so on and

526
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,520
you see that

527
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,280
there are a lot of opportunities there

528
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,039
are opportunities there to to collect

529
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,120
information

530
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,559
another thing that is interesting too

531
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,039
for for bootstrapping a scan and 12k

532
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,559
a regional scan is to start with

533
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,679
a complete dump of the reverse ptr

534
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,520
of the ipv4 space so as you know ipv4 is

535
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,679
2 power 32 so that means you can

536
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,000
enumerate all the amperages

537
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,400
but you can enumerate the reverse and

538
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,039
trim the dns for all those appearances

539
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,200
and if you do that then it's very

540
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,280
interesting because you can find out

541
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,000
a lot of associated domain names for an

542
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,120
hyperlapses

543
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,000
in specific namespace or outsider block

544
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,840
which are for example allocated in other

545
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,400
countries

546
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,880
so it's one way to find out if for

547
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,440
example some ipv4 that are located for

548
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,559
example in u.s

549
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,160
should be for example located now in

550
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,919
russia and you have a block of

551
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,320
iprs where you have for example dot ru

552
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,120
domain there

553
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,200
so it's one way to achieve for example

554
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,960
when you do scan to make more

555
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,320
regional scan based on reverse pcr

556
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,360
is one way to do that additionally it's

557
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,440
again a nice source of information

558
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,760
to bootstrap your dns brute forces to

559
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,280
extract the domain names and so on and

560
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,799
again to do the same

561
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,440
jobs on before like the ct log that you

562
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,880
were analyzing before

563
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,080
to extract all those uh ipv6 classes and

564
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,120
ipv4 assist

565
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,760
and again to scan those and feed those

566
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,960
to your scanner so

567
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,880
the apd for reverse space is very

568
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,000
interesting

569
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,679
it's giving you a lot of insight there

570
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,919
about the real allocation sometimes of

571
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:02,880
some subnet

572
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,799
even if the wii entry for example from

573
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,000
the regional

574
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,360
registry is incorrect

575
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,960
another thing that is i think quite

576
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,039
interesting and uh the noises that we

577
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,640
are doing uh quite a lot

578
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,600
a lot of people are deploying services

579
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,200
on

580
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,799
github for example and other services

581
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,160
will not only get up at

582
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,960
the gitlab and and some others and many

583
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,600
of those

584
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,880
provide a public stream of all the

585
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,480
projects that have been committed and so

586
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,720
on so it's giving you a real

587
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,559
gold mine off of potential stand there

588
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,840
because you basically have the comics

589
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,919
you have the source code

590
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,160
and a lot of organizations for example

591
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,360
are

592
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,679
testing in pre-production from github

593
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,520
push pushing code

594
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,280
and then you end up presenting your

595
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,360
stand there so you can find

596
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,080
their potential vulnerable devices

597
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,160
misconfigured devices and things like

598
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,280
that so

599
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,039
i mean if you're a defender it's very

600
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,320
good to do it because at the end

601
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,159
attackers are doing it too we have seen

602
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,159
that we did some tests where we were

603
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,679
pushing information into

604
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,600
into github and so on and some hostname

605
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,360
were scanned by a source party so

606
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,760
in any case it's good to do it and for

607
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,039
doing that

608
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,120
we have a small library that i developed

609
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,120
some years ago called domain classifier

610
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,919
this one is really simple but it's i

611
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:22,559
think

612
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,880
one way to divide and conquer such kind

613
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,440
of data is automatically extracting

614
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,400
all the potential of them and and

615
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,200
generating ipv6 um doing dns lookup and

616
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,240
so on and then you can

617
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,000
find out the real us name and the

618
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,080
associated ipv6

619
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,559
addresses and so on so it's one way it's

620
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,840
a very good source and you can do that

621
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,760
with any unstructured data sources

622
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,760
i mean social network forum and so on

623
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,919
and it's one way it's another way to to

624
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:48,559
scan

625
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,559
not a complete space that you you want

626
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,240
to find vulnerable machines but just

627
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,280
only looking at austin that are being

628
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,320
recently published

629
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,960
in um in github for example

630
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,600
another things and and uh it's quite

631
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,400
interesting too

632
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
there are some providers providing uh

633
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,679
what they call the newly registered

634
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,799
domain list

635
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,720
so it's list of all those new domains

636
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,559
that has been registered

637
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,280
some are accessible uh who i can so they

638
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,559
have a program called

639
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,520
feed yes which is providing an access

640
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,000
you can

641
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,799
register ask for entries and you will

642
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,240
get the entries of

643
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,000
specific tlt not all of them so i mean

644
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
for example some countries specifically

645
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,919
are not providing such kind of screen

646
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,520
which is for example the case in example

647
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,799
but

648
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,120
so it's sometimes difficult to get there

649
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,960
if you purchase the feed from some

650
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,919
vendor

651
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,960
it's existing but it can be very costly

652
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,120
another strategy there is to use passive

653
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,400
dna stream

654
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,559
because passive dns contains newly

655
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,520
registered domains

656
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,200
indirectly because people start to query

657
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,280
those and in addition to that you have

658
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,520
already ipv4 and ipvc targets

659
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,000
associated to the record which is giving

660
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,240
a very nice source for uh scanning and

661
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,880
so on so

662
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,000
that's another way of finding

663
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,799
the active active scanning another way

664
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,840
to do it is to

665
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,360
look at the bgp monitoring aspect so

666
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,280
when you you need to scan sometimes you

667
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,960
basically scan the world internet

668
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,039
but it's not so efficient uh sometimes

669
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,720
you just want to scan for example fees

670
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,280
that are

671
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,440
very less sound which are unstable

672
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,120
because some unstable networks are in

673
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,440
current setup mode and stuff like that

674
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,120
because you can prioritize the scanning

675
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,480
on networks that have

676
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,080
the highest probability of the

677
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,360
vulnerable machine and so on that you

678
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,640
can notify

679
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,240
so monitoring bgp message is very

680
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,760
interesting you can

681
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,320
find new side of block announce in ipv6

682
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,280
and p4 so

683
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,440
that's quite interesting you don't need

684
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,520
to have a complete bgp setup for doing

685
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:43,919
that

686
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,799
um hype is providing a very nice feature

687
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,240
called the

688
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,960
routine information service life which

689
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,600
is like a complete feed of all their bgp

690
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,159
centers

691
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,000
around the world and you get all the

692
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
messages coming there so it's a very

693
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,120
nice sources

694
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,200
and this one has a lot of potential for

695
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,320
finding out

696
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,840
new networks and so on especially in

697
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,840
stable one and so on um

698
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,600
it's a very good source for doing that

699
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,440
kind of

700
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,919
in addition to what we do and what we

701
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,440
did for the some

702
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,039
past year it's analyzing the network

703
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,720
telescope aspect

704
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,960
so if you have a network telescope you

705
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,320
have a

706
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,760
gathering unsolicited network traffic

707
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,159
and you can analyze everything that you

708
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,159
get also that for example sometimes you

709
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,159
get dns requests that are interesting to

710
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:30,799
again

711
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,679
do scanning back uh things like that uh

712
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,280
you can even do it with

713
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,400
extractions out of some gre uh

714
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,559
packet that are sent in ipv4 so it's

715
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,279
sometimes giving some interesting things

716
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,960
another thing that is interesting too if

717
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,640
you see for example some specific

718
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,559
society

719
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,000
ending in your black hole like for

720
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,320
example scanning ssh kind of rdp and six

721
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,039
like

722
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,960
it's already giving you a huge insight

723
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,080
to you that okay

724
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,559
those societies are very interesting so

725
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,640
you can use those as a kind of privacy

726
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,360
mechanism

727
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,679
for scanning but instead of scanning

728
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:04,880
again sequentially

729
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,600
you can reorder your scan based on the

730
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,279
different source that you see

731
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,760
on your rob blackcode the only drawback

732
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,200
for this solution and you have finished

733
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,000
the past year the volume of newly ipv6

734
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,600
and phone is very low so it's an

735
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,360
interesting source you might

736
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,080
find very interesting earth but it's not

737
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,919
a constant stream like the certificate

738
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,320
transparency where you see a lot of

739
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,600
entries spotting events on

740
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,520
so that's basically it for me for the

741
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,799
introduction of the active scanning

742
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,000
techniques um

743
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,240
the goal of the presentation of today is

744
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,799
really to bootstrap a kind of uh

745
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,880
github account where we will list all

746
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,080
the techniques

747
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,600
that we know about for the active

748
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,120
scannings as i said

749
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,679
um not exhaustive there so maybe some of

750
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,200
the techniques are not

751
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,000
missing some techniques are maybe uh not

752
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,240
really applicable for you and so on so

753
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,919
um don't hesitate to go to the github

754
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,279
repository

755
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,840
we'll add some some markdown document

756
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,200
there with

757
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,559

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,440
more than two years now working as that

853
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,159
in that position we are both very

854
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,640
excited about uh presenting today about

855
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,880
integration of an operational situation

856
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,880
awareness team

857
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,159
and we are going to uh more precisely

858
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,480
develop the need for specific missions

859
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,840
when ending up when getting more major

860
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,480
so what is uh operational situation

861
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,399
overnight

862
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,679
one might wonder and i'm gonna let lina

863
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,559
develop that point

864
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,720
um so yes thank you let's start with the

865
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
the core of our presentation what we're

866
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,240
going to talk about

867
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,159
uh which is operational situational

868
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,520
awareness

869
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,919
um in this presentation we'll talk about

870
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:48,960
it as both

871
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,320
a mission and they too and

872
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,440
as they mentioned we define it as

873
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,880
the fact as being able to give a

874
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,679
synthetic

875
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,120
and analytic picture at any given time

876
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,399
of any incident response activity you'll

877
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:06,720
see

878
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,240
in the the presentation that interactive

879
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,000
it takes a really different format

880
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,200
and it is used for very

881
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,480
diverse uh and a large panel of

882
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,519
uh incident response activities and what

883
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,880
we want to show you

884
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,000
uh today is how it works uh

885
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,480
how useful it is for a national and

886
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,840
governmental sectors

887
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,200
as a san fran but we also hope

888
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,399
that you'll see how it can be applied to

889
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,279
any other incident response both from

890
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,919
the privates and the public sectors

891
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,279
as well for our team uh

892
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,679
well it was created in 2017 um

893
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,919
and at the time esther will save a

894
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,760
little bit more into it afterwards

895
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,120
uh so trent was reorganizing all of its

896
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,879
operational themes and activities

897
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,720
um so today we're gonna we're gonna

898
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,600
tackle three main points first uh what

899
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,000
does the need for creating the theme

900
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,120
come from uh what it says three years

901
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,919
later

902
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,399
meaning what we do on a daily basis who

903
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,000
we interact with

904
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,559
um and what we do within an incident

905
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,919
response scheme

906
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,960
and finally uh the challenges we face

907
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,840
building this human us to safety

908
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,679
sometimes

909
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,880
and also we start with the the blood

910
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,799
where does it come from what does that

911
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:37,919
need come from

912
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,840
and the origin of our situation

913
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,320
awareness

914
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,799
uh so first thing first uh let's get

915
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,000
started with the

916
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,240
when the how and the why was created

917
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,399
so in order to do that as then i told

918
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,519
you um

919
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,919
i have to take you back to year

920
00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:00,080
2017 when the year went

921
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,200
france was reorganizing its operations

922
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,760
at that time situation awareness already

923
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,120
existed

924
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,200
but in a different format in a less

925
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,039
developed form in comparison with the

926
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,000
current one

927
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,320
as it was personally assigned to team

928
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,480
which main mission was cyber threat

929
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,240
intelligence

930
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,120
now two important reasons of creating a

931
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,159
specific team

932
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,039
and integrating it to incident response

933
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:25,840
teams

934
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,919
for that first of all uh situational

935
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,080
awareness was mainly used for

936
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,039
major incidents and at the time it was

937
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:33,679
more

938
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,519
situation report mission than an

939
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,320
analysis therefore the entertainment

940
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:38,960
variable

941
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,640
were longer and looked more like a

942
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,000
situation playbook

943
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,919
which was sufficient until their

944
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,760
organization

945
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,159
at the time that france was getting more

946
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:48,799
major

947
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,960
and the volume of operational

948
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,320
operational activity was

949
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,679
increasing some major incidents

950
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,080
made it clear that there was a need for

951
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,640
easily accessible analysis of a given

952
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,600
situation

953
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,440
that would serve decision making for

954
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,879
leaders and a group it also wrapped it

955
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:09,599
turned out

956
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,480
that this need for clarity and synthetic

957
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,320
vision was not limited to the

958
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,359
major incidents but also for the world

959
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,639
incident response scene second of all

960
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:20,960
the

961
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,359
cyber threat creation uh the cyberside

962
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,918
information situation team was separated

963
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:26,639
the fact

964
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,440
from the incident response technical

965
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,239
themes

966
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,040
and given the separation distribution

967
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,679
overnight

968
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,040
was uh scattered among that team

969
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,520
and technical experts on the other side

970
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,000
were facing time-consuming solicitation

971
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,399
from

972
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:47,440
the management uh so therefore

973
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,960
it was decided to create

974
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,440
that was fully integrated within the

975
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,199
incident responses

976
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,960
um include

977
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,800
technical experts teams in terms of

978
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,240
triage

979
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,560
that would be able to take charge of

980
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,359
operational

981
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,640
uh situation awareness for both to

982
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,880
all incident response activities and for

983
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,839
major

984
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,880
incidents and it was also create decided

985
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,880
to

986
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,200
the situation awareness analysis mission

987
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,440
with another one which is operational

988
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,160
activity

989
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,680
regulation so you understand uh why

990
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,079
why uh just after i get you through a

991
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:28,800
little bit about

992
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,240
what is operational activities

993
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,640
regulation

994
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,400
um okay so actually

995
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,119
this activity was a brand new mission

996
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,800
when it was created in 2017

997
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,040
the mission and the objective of this of

998
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,560
this new uh

999
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,280
this new team is to control the proper

1000
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,240
and the good running

1001
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,520
uh of the incident response team

1002
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,880
uh interestingly until 2019

1003
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,440
uh it was done by operational uh

1004
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,200
situation analysts on the

1005
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,240
best effort mode and since then it has

1006
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:04,960
been

1007
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,440
fully stopped so how do they

1008
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,480
they complete this mission

1009
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,400
various ways by constantly reviewing

1010
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,280
others

1011
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,920
then handled by the uniformization of

1012
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,440
incident treatment

1013
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,920
by doing a first-level transversal

1014
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,960
analysis with

1015
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,560
comparing emerging alert incidents

1016
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,839
which is a of great value for all the

1017
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:32,560
teams

1018
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,599
in the incidence response thing and they

1019
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,960
also suggest

1020
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,400
actions like prioritization escalation

1021
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,880
within the incident response stain and

1022
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,760
so this

1023
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,800
job which not existed before um

1024
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,599
enables really interesting things for uh

1025
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,040
south france

1026
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,119
as a matter of fact regulators have a

1027
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,079
central vision

1028
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,800
of operational activities and they can

1029
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,520
give

1030
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,160
at any given time a vision of the search

1031
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,480
resources engaged in instant response

1032
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,440
activities

1033
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,000
and also produce a trend and so this

1034
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,839
central vision really give them

1035
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,520
a hand new support decision making for

1036
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,720
the head of restaurant division and

1037
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,160
globally france leaders

1038
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,240
and second of all not only do they have

1039
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,000
a central vision but they also

1040
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,320
have a full operational picture thanks

1041
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,599
to its position with

1042
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,160
student response saying and so as such

1043
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,640
um

1044
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,520
it is the most capable of identifying

1045
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,599
and alerting of emerging fans or

1046
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,000
increasing incoming incidents

1047
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,480
um and so this um

1048
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,400
the reason why these two missions were

1049
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,720
created together is because well they're

1050
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,760
complementary

1051
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,440
and basically a situation awareness

1052
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,760
analysts and regulators work on a daily

1053
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,720
basis

1054
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,560
and i let lina tell you a little bit

1055
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,880
more about that

1056
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,960
um operational

1057
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,079
regulation is uh for the

1058
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,400
rest of today we're gonna mostly focus

1059
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,320
on what situation awareness

1060
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,800
does but it's important to keep in mind

1061
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,880
that first missions even though they are

1062
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,839
very different um they complement each

1063
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:18,320
other

1064
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,920
uh very well uh what makes them

1065
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,480
different

1066
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,880
was situation awareness analysts are

1067
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,520
working

1068
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,880
on incidents and they are actually part

1069
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,280
of the incident response

1070
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,200
whereas operational activities

1071
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,400
regulators

1072
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,680
uh are controlling and supervising the

1073
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,920
transport chain make sure ensuring that

1074
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,839
everything runs smoothly

1075
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,960
and mostly they work on how incidents

1076
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,400
are handled so both activities are quite

1077
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,359
compliments

1078
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,880
comprehensively to each other in that

1079
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,280
that way

1080
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,800
just now a little focused on human

1081
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,280
resources needed in order to accomplish

1082
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
the mission described

1083
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,480
so as you understand uh the amount of

1084
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,720
work behind the mission described

1085
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,680
earlier

1086
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,800
really depends on the impacts but also

1087
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,320
the volume of incidents

1088
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,839
modified and handled at cell trunks um

1089
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:21,040
so let's just take a look at the volume

1090
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,599
for year

1091
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,960
2020 for instance these are the numbers

1092
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,200
you can find in the annual reports of

1093
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,320
and and you have the link on the slide

1094
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,000
um elena will um tell you a little bit

1095
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,040
more about uh

1096
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,119
these notions and what they stand for

1097
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,720
for what to understand by major

1098
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,359
incidents

1099
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,119
comparing with incidents or cyber

1100
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,640
defense operation

1101
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,720
um after but what is interesting here is

1102
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,320
to see that there is a certain and

1103
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,760
ever growing amount of security events

1104
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,800
handled at france and so

1105
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,680
we estimate that in order to tackle the

1106
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,880
missions we have

1107
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,640
uh it requires six uh situation analysts

1108
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,040
and

1109
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,119
two or three regulations analysis um

1110
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,720
as for the the profile needed to fill

1111
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,520
this different uh position

1112
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,240
where they are quite hybrid are needed

1113
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,359
people who can

1114
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,160
understand and analyze a very complex

1115
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,000
and diverse situation

1116
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,880
and its technical details uh in a very

1117
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,000
short time

1118
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,240
but generally people with uh business

1119
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,359
intelligence or

1120
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,560
political science background uh or and

1121
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:32,960
or

1122
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,839
engineering and a strong understanding

1123
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,680
of the cybersecurity

1124
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,839
elements are needed

1125
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,160
naturally this pool of candidates is

1126
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,920
more gender balanced than pure

1127
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,280
engineering posts

1128
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,280
which is well something quite clear

1129
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,280
within the cyber security field and

1130
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,800
that's

1131
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,520
not worthy

1132
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,160
uh thank you know that you

1133
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,040
understand where we come from uh we're

1134
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,119
gonna try to talk a little bit more

1135
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,079
about uh what we do on a daily basis

1136
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,920
uh what it actually means to have a

1137
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,760
inspirational awareness

1138
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,440
um integrated to a search

1139
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,160
uh but before we go into detail i want

1140
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,440
to come back to uh what uh

1141
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,760
uh a little bit what we call at third

1142
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,560
friends are

1143
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,400
treatment modes um in fact incident

1144
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,079
response is organized in

1145
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,240
two types of treatment modes according

1146
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,960
to the nature of the incidents

1147
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,079
based on the sensitivity

1148
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,400
surrounding the victim but also the

1149
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,359
level of

1150
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,480
impact the event has on the information

1151
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,599
system that is detected

1152
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,520
and uh we talk for the the

1153
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,440
cyber defense operations which are

1154
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,200
usually the incidents with

1155
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,480
on the larger scale uh what is created

1156
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,000
is a specific you know to which a

1157
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
situation awareness analyst is

1158
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,599
integrated uh

1159
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,480
specifically for the the rest of the

1160
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,119
treatment

1161
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,680
modes uh other incidents and major

1162
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,119
incidents

1163
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,520
uh what they are treated by the

1164
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,599
classical i want to say

1165
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,119
incident responsing with a an escalation

1166
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,319
process that is

1167
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,599
um put into place when and if

1168
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,720
necessary and situation awareness has

1169
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,200
also

1170
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,400
a different rule uh for that uh

1171
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,410
within that uh incident crystal

1172
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:36,240
[Music]

1173
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,359
for us by telling you about what you do

1174
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,040
in cyber defense operations

1175
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,960
and after we'll tell you a little bit

1176
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,240
more about what we do

1177
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,720
uh the rest of incident response

1178
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,160
first favorite defense operations well

1179
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,560
uh as i mentioned through this type of

1180
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,560
event a specific theme

1181
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,119
is created within a sort france overseen

1182
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,560
by a team leader

1183
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,000
a cyber defense creation manager who

1184
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,160
operates a matrix management that team

1185
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,119
is composed of different experts such as

1186
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,560
a forensic coordinator

1187
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,680
a cgi specialist for instance but also a

1188
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,920
situational awareness analyst

1189
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,400
whose lab in that context is to produce

1190
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,119
two types

1191
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,240
of deliverables first of all

1192
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,960
we produce uh regular situation analysis

1193
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,000
reports

1194
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,040
that are disseminated among operational

1195
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,720
and managements in within search trends

1196
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,359
and given the evolution of the incident

1197
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:38,160
these reports

1198
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,200
are produced between once a day to once

1199
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,359
every few weeks

1200
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,920
and secondly we also produce a specific

1201
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,800
treatment analysis report

1202
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,000
on demand on or when relevant

1203
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,079
that can be shared outside of such

1204
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,599
friends towards

1205
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,560
more uh political authorities or toward

1206
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,200
partners

1207
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,359
internationally both international and

1208
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:02,800
nationals

1209
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,720
and sometimes tourists are constituents

1210
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,279
themselves

1211
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,520
esther will tell you a little bit more

1212
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,800
about uh what

1213
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,160
those reports look like look like

1214
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,400
but what's uh important for you to

1215
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,200
understand is

1216
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,760
that they are quite thorough and they

1217
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,800
try to cover

1218
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,839
a large spectrum of topic as large as

1219
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,760
possible

1220
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,359
meaning and they contain forensic

1221
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:30,319
results

1222
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,000
investigation on the attackers

1223
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,680
infrastructures and motives

1224
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,319
recovery efforts relationship with the

1225
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:37,599
constituents

1226
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,079
and some partners or third parties is

1227
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,599
very awesome

1228
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,200
risk analysis etc and the goal is with

1229
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:45,839
all of that

1230
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,560
to tell you a synthetic picture of the

1231
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,200
incident

1232
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,400
and its treatment within sir france

1233
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,480
while giving a broad understanding of

1234
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,560
the technical elements

1235
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,560
so that's what we try to do for cyber

1236
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,440
defense operation

1237
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,280
um okay so besides cyber defense

1238
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,160
operation

1239
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,880
um situation awareness is involved in

1240
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,680
the

1241
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,640
infant response stain from alert major

1242
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,839
incident

1243
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,160
uh and so these events which represent

1244
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,040
the large majority of what is handled by

1245
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,440
france collects the incident response

1246
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,800
plane after a classic

1247
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,800
there the situation around steam is

1248
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,079
mobilized to give

1249
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,280
a synthetic picture of the

1250
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,720
and response activities of south france

1251
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,000
uh analyzing ongoing friends and

1252
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,720
emerging ones for this mission situation

1253
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,760
awareness

1254
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,160
work closely with operational activity

1255
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,280
regulation

1256
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,920
so as we mentioned earlier we are very

1257
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,920
complementary

1258
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,400
for this mission we also use for

1259
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,000
instance a matrix

1260
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,960
as a specific tool as you can see on the

1261
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,839
bottom right

1262
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,119
hand side of this slide and this matrix

1263
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,000
uh represents

1264
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,119
the volume of security events depending

1265
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,079
on the

1266
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,760
1x epic technology and on the other one

1267
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,520
the level of impact on the information

1268
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,560
and targeted um and this tool is very

1269
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,079
useful for us to have

1270
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,880
a visual and global picture of what has

1271
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,160
been going on

1272
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,440
uh it's very prepared one

1273
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,839
situation on different time frames for

1274
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,480
instance

1275
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,480
if you want what ends things have been

1276
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,119
impacted by a given type of attack

1277
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,640
like ransomwares it's easy but

1278
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,280
like as a bathroom for year 2020 and

1279
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,200
year 2019.

1280
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,040
however in collaboration with

1281
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,119
operational regulation

1282
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,720
patient awareness is in charge of

1283
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,640
producing statistics and

1284
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,040
indicators related to incident response

1285
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,319
activities

1286
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:57,200
and finally similar situation analysis

1287
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,839
reports as the one produced

1288
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,880
for cyber defense operation uh can be

1289
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,760
produced for incidents when relevance

1290
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,240
and

1291
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,319
major incidents quite systematically

1292
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,560
so now i'm going to show you what uh

1293
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,079
situation reports

1294
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,640
look like with an example

1295
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,760
uh of course we cannot view a school

1296
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,880
situation analysis

1297
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,480
the example contains fake text and fake

1298
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,040
people examples what is key here to

1299
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,200
remember is that creation analysis

1300
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,160
reports

1301
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,040
are usually read by people in god's

1302
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,240
management team

1303
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,760
in order to for their decision making

1304
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,079
uh in our case uh as they not told you

1305
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,119
and see leaders

1306
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,440
authorities sometimes that's

1307
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,280
international people who don't have much

1308
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,480
time to read

1309
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,520
so it is paramount that station reports

1310
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:55,920
uh

1311
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,240
are built the way readers can access

1312
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,680
easily and quickly

1313
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,480
in a glance uh key information for

1314
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,000
decision making

1315
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,440
and so in uh this example so on the left

1316
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,920
page on the slide you can see key

1317
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,599
information such as what are we talking

1318
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,119
about what type of incident

1319
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,480
is it what is

1320
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,520
targeted what are the stakeholders what

1321
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,880
is the level of

1322
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,079
risk associated with this incident uh

1323
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,640
you can also have information uh very

1324
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,839
quickly of

1325
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,000
where we in terms of investigation are

1326
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
we engaging action um

1327
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,520
in the reputation actually or not

1328
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,359
of course you have an executive summary

1329
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,599
of what has been going on you have

1330
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,119
what is new about the uh situation uh

1331
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,880
the operational situation you have a

1332
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,880
list of appendix

1333
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,440
of course between these two pages one on

1334
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,720
the left and the right

1335
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,200
then well you have others with details

1336
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:53,760
uh

1337
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,400
but it's best

1338
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,599
on the right page so you have different

1339
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:00,640
examples of

1340
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,920
visual elements produced like timelines

1341
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,720
like uh diagrams it can be something of

1342
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,839
the attack

1343
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,240
but the attack can be examined about the

1344
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,119
fiber

1345
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,280
the labor operation itself but basically

1346
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,440
everything is done so that the readers

1347
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,720
have uh very

1348
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,040
easily accessible information uh

1349
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,880
make decision or just to

1350
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,960
[Music]

1351
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,839
know where to go in terms of

1352
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:31,839
investigation

1353
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,960
um this slide here

1354
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,160
is about giving you an overview

1355
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,280
a summary of what we discussed

1356
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,760
before basically you have uh so the

1357
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,599
treatment modes

1358
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,000
uh that lena presented to you and on the

1359
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,760
right you have the different

1360
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,359
uh articulation uh missions

1361
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,800
uh that analysts are doing so

1362
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,760
you can see there is the reports you

1363
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,400
have

1364
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,400
arrested the trends and the regular

1365
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,000
operational picture

1366
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,720
uh that is a mission and self-esteem

1367
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:13,839
awareness

1368
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,480
that situation awareness is part of

1369
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,920
the whole incident response machine

1370
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,079
um but actually with those missions

1371
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,440
uh situational awareness holds the most

1372
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,400
cross-level vision of incident response

1373
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,119
activities

1374
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,720
in france with operational

1375
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,079
regulation as well so what

1376
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,200
does it do in the fact

1377
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,040
with fundamental help for

1378
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,240
decision-making

1379
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,280
for priority station and it allows

1380
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,240
it loads for a management of the

1381
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,240
information that we share towards

1382
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,920
a partner or authorities

1383
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,680
however it's important to keep in mind

1384
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,040
that situational awareness

1385
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,160
is not uh reporting or information

1386
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,680
management because

1387
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,400
in fact it requires to be able to

1388
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,720
understand and analyze complex technical

1389
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,760
investigation

1390
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,680
uh to take into account the context the

1391
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,000
straight the takes the risk

1392
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,800
all of it in a very short time in order

1393
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,720
to deliver an analysis

1394
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,680
of the operational situation that will

1395
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,559
that is tailored towards the recipients

1396
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,880
and those recipients can be at the

1397
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,960
operational scheme for instance if

1398
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,359
a new uh technical expert arrives on the

1399
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:34,240
internet

1400
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,680
specific incident response those reports

1401
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,000
can

1402
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,359
help them understand what they're

1403
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,040
getting to

1404
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,079
uh it also those recipients can be on

1405
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:45,040
management

1406
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,520
that will use them for decision making

1407
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,440
and prioritization

1408
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,359
or political authorities that will use

1409
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:54,000
them

1410
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,440
for more strategic let's say

1411
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,040
decision making the most difficult part

1412
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,319
is to tailor the the deliverable to the

1413
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,960
the residents

1414
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,640
all right and so last but not least

1415
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,440
we're going to

1416
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,720
tell you a little bit more about how

1417
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,839
we what are the challenges we face

1418
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,920
in order to get fully integrated

1419
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,119
uh so as for the challenges uh

1420
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,640
when the team was created of course

1421
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,400
challenges arose

1422
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,480
which are mission related challenges of

1423
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,240
course but also human resources

1424
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,680
challenges

1425
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,079
uh so besides finding the right place

1426
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:39,680
for the situation awareness

1427
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,040
analysts who are non-technical experts

1428
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,720
we have as we mentioned earlier uh so

1429
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,040
uh finding the place for them among an

1430
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,480
incident response team

1431
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,480
one of the core challenges uh that

1432
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,800
mission and sales was and remains

1433
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,119
finding the right amount of technical

1434
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:58,160
details

1435
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,839
included in deliverable and how to

1436
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:05,280
uh indeed this this deliverable must be

1437
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,319
precise and concise so that the trans

1438
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,240
leaders can exploit them for decision

1439
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,240
making they also need

1440
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,240
to give a comprehensive and thorough

1441
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,000
vision that incident

1442
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,079
response team can exploit them in order

1443
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,319
to keep up with how incidents are

1444
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:21,920
progressing and come up with

1445
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,800
appropriate postures for the treatments

1446
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,119
to present

1447
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,280
um as for the human resources challenges

1448
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,640
we i talked about uh about that a little

1449
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,160
earlier uh basically the new trending

1450
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,119
phase is um how to handle the

1451
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:43,680
ever-growing amount of politicians

1452
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,960
uh which are the price uh of

1453
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,359
that i guess uh of how the team has

1454
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:54,839
proven itself very easy for in this

1455
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:56,960
indispensable and of course there is a

1456
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,280
challenge about recruiting hybrid and

1457
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,920
rare profiles as i just practiced

1458
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,920
and now elena will tell you a bit more

1459
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,599
about the threshold

1460
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,359
get to face um we want to finish

1461
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,400
on that first on that particular

1462
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,200
part because um as a matter of fact it

1463
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,200
takes time to build it in that all

1464
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,240
such specific missions such a new

1465
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,359
mission

1466
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,880
and there were specific uh events or

1467
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,520
thresholds if we can call them that that

1468
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,400
played a

1469
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,480
significant role in demonstrating our

1470
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,800
useful teamwork for the whole instant

1471
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,599
response

1472
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:39,359
activities and here are two examples

1473
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,880
that that can highlight by that point

1474
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,240
uh starting with uh 2019 when search

1475
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,160
front was facing particularly

1476
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,799
complex incidents and at the time the

1477
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:52,240
situation awareness team was

1478
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,119
getting bigger three minutes left thank

1479
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:55,920
you

1480
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,920
uh the situation awareness team was

1481
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,240
getting uh bigger so situation

1482
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,040
an awareness analyst could prove how

1483
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,480
useful they could be in that context

1484
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,920
because they facing steps complexity

1485
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,520
well it turned out that having an

1486
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,760
analyst that is specifically dedicated

1487
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:14,160
to

1488
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,720
making things clear for everyone from

1489
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,880
analysis to management

1490
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,440
is quite precious especially because it

1491
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,119
allows

1492
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,440
for internet handlers or forensic

1493
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,319
coordinators

1494
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,680
to focus on the core of their work

1495
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,799
um and organizing the equipment

1496
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,720
managing the relationship with the

1497
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,240
constituents and everything

1498
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,119
without worrying about the fact that

1499
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,599
their management

1500
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,720
have a clear picture of what's happening

1501
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,839
the second threshold is the pandemic

1502
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:50,880
because as a lot of you i guess

1503
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,200
we were able to work party from home

1504
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,720
the lockdown and at that particular time

1505
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,799
as personal awareness

1506
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,440
and as well uh operational activities

1507
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,480
regulation

1508
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,119
worked for ensuring that there was a

1509
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:08,240
continuity

1510
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,720
in operational activities uh because

1511
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,400
they were instrumental for

1512
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,720
other incident response seemed to keep

1513
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,880
up with the whole um

1514
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,000
operational activity and the picture

1515
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,720
to get to have a clear picture of all of

1516
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,680
it

1517
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,440
it was also at the time

1518
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,160
for fulfilling an increased need an

1519
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,440
increased demand for

1520
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,040
reporting and not analyzing uh incidents

1521
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,640
that specifically targeting the

1522
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,079
healthcare sector

1523
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,280
which became a top one priority for for

1524
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:41,920
everyone

1525
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,960
at the time so

1526
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,079
that's why that's true example of when

1527
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:52,960
the situation awareness team became

1528
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,319
quite quite important to prove their

1529
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:02,240
their value um actually that's it for us

1530
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,839
we remain available if you have

1531
