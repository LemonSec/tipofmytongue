173
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,790
measurement measurements  is there are

174
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,750
considered

175
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,419
more straightforward to further than the

181
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:23,319
one of the key activities in anchoring

00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:26,529
security in the portfolio for for aixam

183
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:29,139
is the establishment of a secure the

organization zo

186
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,009
the crèche and gilly here is the  love

187
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:39,219
people to incorporate security mc

in there day-to-day activities

190
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:46,980
well that's a shirt by a group of

zo in this case the number of science

195
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,360
security  champions in an organization is

196
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,839
measured and based on that the cake mold

197
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,879
a syndicate officially dyscalculia time

198
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,670
where the number of secure the champions

199
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,579
is divided by targets which is then

200
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:12,220
craft over the course of de last 12

201

deck ability management related  was

226

and what wf actors do discussion with

227
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:25,249
with nam security stakeholders is that the

228
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,459
discussions are best acted wit pointing

229
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:30,800
out that without ability management is the

process

231
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:35,300

the former abilities in the producers

235
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,309
this really

236
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,040
tempting to look at the number of

00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,260
with the gay scene and the delivery of the on

280
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,390

281
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,350
for high

282
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,870
severity cases and communication

283
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,640
strategy is the side it

284
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,370
and so here  utilized by the cabinet with

285
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,500
units using security advisor is

286
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,410
and the reason for this explanation is

287
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,470
having this process industrial

288
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,650
does not require and charge amateur level that is

289
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,060
really an enabler

290
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,910
to manage the product securities of the

291
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,270
mobility management matrix and in ark

292
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,210
context how it  would be soviets being

293
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,490
sent out and then you will

294
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,200


295
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,980


296
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,230

00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,110
bases  n the given priority

298
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,760

299
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,590
must be set with the middle of the

300
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,350

301
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,710
is that patients church on shirt with in

342
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:37,079
you will also know what the answer will

343
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:40,860
be that no solution can be made

344

chat to green orange red

347
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,779
there is such a complex to manage and some

348
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,240
with the met extreme come to this

349
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,160
so action rober zale to because she it

350
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,410
is s complex s the  with the with I so also

351
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,290
samples a in in seville 6 but there is

352
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,450
there something to do there

353
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,040
and then finally get it any outside

354
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,310
number or without abilities the number or

355
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,290
to myself without abilities  in the

356
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,780
product and that is a group or with series

357
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,500
know

358
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,230
very high the moon switch at first

359
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,990
glance things like and import en group of

360
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,380
metrics and there a couple of reasons

361
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,480
why there is a large amount for this

362
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,130
group

363
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,440
long ritch is that the can be  very hard

364
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,330
limits set by

365
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,690

wit en even zo

368
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,700
en een number is easy to digest is also

369
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,920
quite straightforward to measure this

370
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,130
besides the [ __ ] dat fits easily

371
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,339
measurable there a not some money order

372
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:01,550
good quality sebas patrick  and surveys

373
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,980
metri group is like a group of wind

374
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,189
measurement with fix it can be any given

375
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:10,640
amber kilometers or miles per hour

376
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,709
you cannot control the less action

377
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:16,970
now mainly the wind speed and the

378
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,189
matrix come to other clicks related to

379
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:21,050
performance the

380
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,390
influenced by factors  that is not really

381
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,160
control at the group that is being

382
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,290

388
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,330
course this can come with the expert or

389
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,730
without bilities that that there is none and

390
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,470
codebase that

391
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,660
you best product organization internet

393
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,210
and sugar is a bias in the metric and

394
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,400
therefore metric  aspires to watch per tablet

397
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,310
secondly the metric is influenced by the

398
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,460
ex tent and the nature of the security

399

arguably the most important topics

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,820
is using this matrix take action  me

an impact and only with myself

549
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,550
it is the couple of key points in in

this decision on going

finally making this matrixx a
