1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,280
after it breaches something that's

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,120
really important and it's something that

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,160
we really need to

4
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,600
spend more time thinking about it's not

5
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,200
only the technical response but also the

6
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,800
social technical response that's

7
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,599
important

8
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,120
and that is what my talk is going to be

9
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,960
um about today so i'm really honored to

10
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,480
speak to you here today so i'll just

11
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,600
i'll just kick things off now so

12
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,520
um you would have seen these uh

13
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,119
circulated and and they'll be

14
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,760
available um in that there's kind of two

15
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,480
bits of

16
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,560
of outputs let's say that that

17
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,920
contribute to this talk

18
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,760
one is an academic paper so i am an

19
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,519
academic but this session i wanted to

20
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,640
pitch it towards

21
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,000
organizations to management in

22
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,480
particular because the research really

23
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,960
is clearly uh towards towards you all

24
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,480
so here's just some quick links where

25
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,000
you can actually find a preprint of the

26
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,440
paper you can find the official paper

27
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,039
and you can also find a white paper that

28
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:45,920
i've created

29
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,760
which summarizes the word that we're i'm

30
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,800
going to present uh today

31
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,640
so firstly let's start off with a quote

32
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,320
so you know let's let's let's kind of

33
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,440
look at the reality of

34
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,440
this and the reality of this comes down

35
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,640
to i mean i think this is a perfect

36
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,239
quote and it really hints on the in the

37
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,480
importance and the reality that today

38
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,119
um it's not the unfortunate reality is

39
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,400
that even though we will try to prepare

40
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,040
for a breach

41
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,960
as as best as possible one of the

42
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,400
realities is that

43
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,159
breaches happen you know we can try our

44
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,520
hardest but attack we need to be

45
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,479
successful

46
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,000
all of the time attackers just need to

47
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,159
be successful once

48
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,000
um so therefore the numbers are stacked

49
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,520
against us and i think the reality comes

50
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,720
out with this quote in that you know

51
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,080
it's really about

52
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,080
unfortunately preparing for for an

53
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,840
attack happening and what do you say

54
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,600
only technically but also social

55
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,840
technically i mean let's jump straight

56
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,520
into this and look at some examples this

57
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,560
is an example from

58
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,520
from the uk so i started to mention i'm

59
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,240
an academic

60
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,280
based in the uk and you can see so talk

61
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,000
talk

62
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,079
a big telecommunications provider um was

63
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,720
breached back in 2015

64
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,320
and the article was released and there

65
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,399
was basically uh some press around it

66
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,240
and one of the kind of key quotes a lot

67
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,439
of people remember

68
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,759
is the ceo mentioning i can't confirm a

69
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,159
customer's data was encrypted

70
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,200
i think this is this is really

71
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,439
interesting because it does highlight

72
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,280
um you know at that point in time they

73
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,439
weren't sure that whether data was

74
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,560
encrypted or not

75
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,318
and no things have progressed since then

76
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,840
but another thing that we should really

77
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,319
consider here and is this so this is not

78
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,760
the highest quality image

79
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,200
but one thing i want to highlight here

80
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,040
is you know this person

81
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,400
um being very worried about um the

82
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,360
the being the way the way how they found

83
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,560
out about this breach

84
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,360
and figuring that actually um talk

85
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,879
should have contacted them and should

86
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,560
have engaged with them more so this is a

87
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,519
really interesting thing

88
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,280
as it looks around even the impact of

89
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,200
social media today as it comes to

90
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,560
breaches

91
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,160
another breach you know you would have

92
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,080
all i'm sure heard about the equifax

93
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,959
data breach

94
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,640
and that was covered extensively and

95
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,400
various different news outlets

96
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,840
um some of the more interesting things

97
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,760
around it once again for pertaining to

98
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,800
comms

99
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,160
looking at you know the walls journal

100
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,160
highlighting that it took them six weeks

101
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,360
to disclose the attack

102
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,879
but also their questions really are

103
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,959
around um you know how they actually

104
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,159
went about communicating with

105
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,480
others using separate domain names um

106
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,280
there are even some

107
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,120
some uh reports saying that they

108
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,800
mystically tweeted

109
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,560
uh a phishing link so not the correct

110
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,480
link to to the uh

111
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,000
for customers and for state holds anyone

112
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,080
impacted and then there was also

113
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,959
um so this is a uh an image from crypto

114
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,120
security and and what

115
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,800
he mentions based on his research is

116
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,159
that if you actually

117
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,400
checked whether you're impacted on the

118
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
phone versus on your your computer you

119
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,440
would actually getting

120
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,200
different messages so one was saying

121
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,720
you're not impacted the other one

122
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,879
was saying that you may have been

123
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,120
impacted so once again that highlights

124
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,440
and

125
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,799
really kind of emphasizes this reality

126
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,040
here about trying to get um corporate

127
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,720
communications right

128
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,400
and that brings me really to the kind of

129
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,760
crux of the question which i want to

130
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,200
pose to you today which we were

131
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,400
discussing today

132
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,840
and that is what this effective

133
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,519
corporate communications and pr look

134
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,959
like after an incident

135
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,640
because it's really important because

136
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,920
when we think about this you really need

137
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,879
to try to figure out

138
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,360
what should you say who should say um

139
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,560
what's the best way

140
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,239
how quickly should you come forward all

141
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,159
these things are really really um key

142
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,680
given the the impact that they have on

143
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,040
stakeholders and of course given the

144
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,159
impact on things

145
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,000
um get considering things like laws

146
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,959
regulations and so on

147
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,799
so the way how it's about this work is

148
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,000
is kind of in a typical

149
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,319
academic fashion um i'll stick with the

150
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,079
kind of boring academic bits

151
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,918
um but the point here is that what what

152
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,160
we tried to do was we tried to

153
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,079
try to explore what was best practiced

154
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,000
in research so basically what was your

155
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,120
research saying

156
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,880
um how you should respond when it comes

157
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,320
to data breaches

158
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,120
and what you should say corporately and

159
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,720
what you should say generally um to the

160
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,919
public for example

161
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,639
and to customers and then we also try to

162
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,320
look at best practices based on a number

163
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,919
of real world um

164
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,680
security incidents so these were

165
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,919
incidents where a company was breached

166
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,759
um there was some mention in the public

167
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,120
domain and we've actually looked and

168
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,160
tried to monitor

169
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,759
what did the company say how did they

170
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,400
say how was the response perceived by

171
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,919
by some security professionals and

172
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,919
experts and then what we did was we

173
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,919
combined two of these different areas

174
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,280
um so we looked at the academic best

175
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,560
practice we looked at industry best

176
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,400
practice we combined these we evaluated

177
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,080
and we compared and contrasted

178
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,320
try to extract some best practice guided

179
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,840
so we're trying to really pull from both

180
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,800
fields here

181
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,039
and to try to then develop and evaluate

182
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,800
a framework and the framework is really

183
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,360
the

184
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,960
the thing that we're proposing in this

185
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
research

186
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
so i'll go through just the the some of

187
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,479
those two initial bits and then we'll

188
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,680
kind of go through uh

189
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,600
the framework towards the end of the

190
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,880
talk

191
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,800
or to the middle or end of the talk so

192
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,560
in terms of the

193
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,120
um the initial part thinking about

194
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,960
themes and best practices

195
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,039
so from an academic perspective one

196
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,320
thing that was really interesting that

197
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,600
academic work focuses

198
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,000
or has focused quite a bit on what was

199
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,759
the stock market's reaction after a

200
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,680
breach so it's almost getting the kind

201
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,320
of

202
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,479
the key what was the knee jerk reaction

203
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,080
so this company this organization was

204
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,800
breach

205
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,400
what happened in the stock market and

206
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,320
what we saw there was often of course

207
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,400
there's uh almost an immediate drop part

208
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,080
immediate impact from the stock market

209
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,759
but what we saw was that often in many

210
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,840
cases especially if the company survived

211
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,919
that long term the actual the the impact

212
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,360
would actually tailor off in that you

213
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,160
could almost

214
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,039
not see it in many many cases there is

215
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:07,440
also

216
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,840
a massive emphasis on legal requirements

217
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,600
to notify and this of course makes

218
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,039
perfect sense

219
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,960
because when we think about it there is

220
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,240
really uh you know

221
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,160
the way how you go about breaches and

222
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,080
what you need to respond with how you

223
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,400
need to

224
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
respond a lot of this is actually

225
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,680
governed by

226
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,240
uh exactly what are the regulations in

227
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,520
the particular part of the world where

228
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:27,919
you're

229
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,280
in because they will often tell you you

230
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,120
need to notify by this time you need to

231
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,000
notify these individuals and so on

232
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,400
message frame was another big point um

233
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,840
that was also about how do you actually

234
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,680
communicate a message

235
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,880
this there's a massive emphasis on

236
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,319
protecting reputation and probably

237
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,199
that's not very

238
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,680
surprising especially a given type of

239
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,199
organization you might be

240
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,280
you might be very focused on well how do

241
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,960
we actually go about and what do we say

242
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,199
to protect our our reputation

243
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,080
um negative emotions and complex uh uh

244
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,599
complexity of outsourced functions is

245
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,880
also another thing that i'll come on to

246
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,720
a bit later on

247
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,960
but basically so from uh analyzing those

248
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,720
kind of key themes in the research what

249
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,800
we then try to do is to try to extract a

250
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,319
number of best practices like i

251
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,360
mentioned before

252
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,160
the extra academic research just for for

253
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,520
the fun of it we were really trying to

254
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,479
get to the detail

255
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,560
in terms of what are the best practices

256
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,840
from academic research

257
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,599
about what companies should say or how

258
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,240
they should act after a breach

259
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,639
and what we found was that um there was

260
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,400
a one of the key points was this idea of

261
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,440
demonstrating a commitment to

262
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,120
stakeholders in that

263
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,599
if you've been breached um the important

264
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,919
thing is for you to actually be able to

265
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,759
first you know almost come clean and say

266
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,199
okay we've been breached and

267
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,880
here is what we're going to do uh in

268
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,560
response here's what we're going to do

269
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,680
to ensure

270
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,680
that we're going to keep your data safe

271
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,960
or that we're going to keep the are

272
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,639
interactive with you safe or secure

273
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,520
going forward

274
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,879
so that was a really key thing kind of

275
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,479
this this focus on addressing the

276
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,599
problem

277
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,280
you know a lot of stakeholders expected

278
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,639
you to do that

279
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,720
um they must jurisdictional complexity

280
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,400
uh like i mentioned before that's that's

281
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
that was massive um and that's one of

282
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,080
the key best practices we tried to

283
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,120
try to to focus on um in the reality

284
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,000
that

285
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,479
after a breach occurs you have to stop

286
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,240
and pause and consider okay we're the

287
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,520
various individuals that have been

288
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,440
imparted by this breach

289
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,560
because of course you know you might

290
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,319
have individuals across the world and

291
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,560
then how what are the kind of legal

292
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,240
requirements based on where that

293
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,080
individual or those individuals

294
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,759
are so that's also another key component

295
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,120
we also have this idea of message

296
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,800
framing like i mentioned above

297
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,199
um it's really important i mean i've

298
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,200
seen a number of cases where

299
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,719
organizations have focus on let's say

300
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,919
getting the message out as quickly as

301
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,640
possible

302
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,479
and the message is framed in a way that

303
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,080
you know only technical individuals can

304
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,958
understand it

305
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,479
but you really need to consider who are

306
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,839
the target group that you're going after

307
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,279
and what are the key things you want to

308
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,640
tell them

309
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,399
um so framing this and framing is

310
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,760
critical and

311
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,279
really interesting from academia there

312
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,279
was a large focus on blaming the

313
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,560
attacker so

314
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,959
kind of almost publicly saying well yes

315
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,240
we've been breached but you know it was

316
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,839
those bad attackers over there it wasn't

317
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,200
really our fault

318
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,959
um and then the last one can decide to

319
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,720
be around the emotional impact and i

320
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,320
think this goes back actually based on

321
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,680
the the earlier tweet that i showed you

322
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,480
above

323
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,399
which actually focused on the reality

324
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,920
that some people can get really upset

325
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,519
when after a data breach

326
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,120
and even if individuals haven't been

327
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
impacted financially there's kind of an

328
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,240
emotional

329
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,399
impact that also is a much impact on

330
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,160
harm that's also important

331
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,600
which we need to consider

332
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,040
now the next thing i want to talk to you

333
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,959
about so we covered the academic side of

334
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,320
things so of course i'm sure many of you

335
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,680
are there are that practitioner so you

336
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,880
really care about what happens with the

337
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,120
practitioner side of things

338
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,680
so what we did was we actually um uh we

339
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,440
tried to focus on a number of different

340
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,800
uh breaches you can see that the

341
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,480
organizations that we focused on uh on

342
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,839
your screen now

343
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,240
on the left and so we looked at company

344
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,600
various different companies

345
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,519
as you see here and then what we tried

346
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,279
to look at was firstly

347
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,120
you know these on all these companies

348
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,560
have been breached i should have said

349
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,000
so we looked at the incidents around

350
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,080
these companies and then we tried to

351
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,480
look at

352
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,240
okay well here are the instances on

353
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,760
strongly these companies

354
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,640
how have they responded and what were

355
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,040
what

356
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,640
and how were they how was that response

357
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,320
actually perceived by key individuals in

358
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,680
the industry

359
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,160
and they stay key individuals meaning uh

360
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,760
individuals such as the individuals you

361
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,480
can also

362
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,839
screen so we looked at now you're on

363
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,320
security krebs on security troy hunt

364
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,920
we live security and you know all of

365
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,760
these and these we chose these in

366
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,880
particular because these are well

367
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,399
recognized as kind of key

368
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,920
um people in the security field and

369
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,320
security domain so we wanted to see what

370
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,959
was their

371
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,000
uh thoughts on this the these various

372
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,480
breaches

373
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,200
so now jumping directly to the theme the

374
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,079
key things that

375
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,320
came up from our analysis so we

376
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,160
recognize that this idea of credibility

377
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,680
of statements is really important

378
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,959
so looking at um the the fact that you

379
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,240
know you have to release statements of

380
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,360
course but you have to release

381
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,800
statements that are actually believable

382
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,240
and that don't just

383
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,200
almost try to put a plaster on on the on

384
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,880
the moon

385
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,720
next this idea about dunk playing so one

386
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,399
thing we recognized was that um

387
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,240
in many cases organizations would try to

388
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,760
dump and play a breach so they would say

389
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,560
oh well

390
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,560
um yes the breach happened but maybe it

391
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,800
was only a thousand records or maybe it

392
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,839
was only

393
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,600
uh ten thousand records but we actually

394
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,200
processed millions of records this idea

395
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,320
of dumpling

396
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,880
was not really looked upon well at all

397
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,600
you know it

398
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,360
it's almost seen as you need to

399
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,200
understand and appreciate that when an

400
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,480
organization or individual

401
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,480
gives you their data if that data is

402
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,079
breached or lost you really need to

403
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,680
understand the importance of that data

404
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,800
to the individual and show that

405
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,279
importance publicly

406
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,959
and that also touches on my other point

407
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,519
i ie this this reality of focusing on

408
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,959
the customer the customer is really

409
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,040
important as well

410
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,279
um of course not disclosing and delaying

411
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,200
is a massive question um you know one of

412
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,040
the poor questions i'm asking you

413
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,000
one of the key realities is um you know

414
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,600
many of them might be saying well yeah

415
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,240
okay in the case of a breach do you wait

416
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,959
for example

417
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,160
until you figure out exactly what's

418
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,519
happened and don't say anything even if

419
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,560
they're suspected

420
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,120
if people suspect that there's breach or

421
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,240
or do you kind of

422
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,320
report uh you know publicly immediately

423
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,680
these are all kind of important

424
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,880
questions which we come on to a bit

425
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,240
later

426
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,920
admission of responsibility is another

427
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,680
interesting one simply because that

428
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,279
touches on

429
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,240
the the reality that in many cases

430
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,839
organizations actually don't want to ask

431
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,279
that responsibility

432
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,279
and they want to get blame the attacker

433
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,279
but in in what we've what we found based

434
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,639
on our research is that

435
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,360
um stakeholders and customers they

436
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,959
actually appreciate it more when the

437
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:27,360
company

438
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,880
accepts some responsibility because at

439
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,959
the end of the day that the data was

440
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,480
given to the company the given it was

441
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,839
given to the organization to

442
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,320
to to keep to work with to secure and

443
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,440
the organization has

444
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,320
lost that data and then this last point

445
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,760
about previous data breaches

446
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,920
and this came up in particular when um

447
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,880
the reality was

448
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,880
a company was breached maybe for the

449
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,079
second or third time

450
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,760
yet they were still releasing in their

451
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,600
statements we you know we really take

452
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,360
security very very seriously

453
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,519
but that actually acted to antagonize

454
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,440
individuals simply because

455
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,760
if you take security seriously how is

456
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,959
this your third or

457
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,800
or you know second or third breach of

458
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,200
customer data

459
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,360
so from those themes what what i tried

460
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,560
to do then was

461
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,639
was uh extract a number of kind of key

462
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,560
best practices similar to what we did

463
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,760
with the academic work before so here

464
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,320
you see kind of uh four key ones that i

465
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,360
present

466
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,920
one looked at being prepared and the

467
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,560
point here

468
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,880
is that you need to actually have

469
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,639
relevant statements and relevant

470
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,480
statements that you can actually release

471
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,680
um and be off done beforehand you

472
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,440
there should never be a case where a

473
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,360
breach has happened you are now thinking

474
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,839
and drafting up from the beginning um as

475
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,120
a statement you should have

476
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,399
templates of statements that you should

477
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,720
have prepared and these should also be

478
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,839
based on facts and based on the

479
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:44,959
realities

480
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,480
because people will um investigate them

481
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,760
this this point of accepting

482
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,920
responsibility this came up as a massive

483
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,120
uh a large point from from the from the

484
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,000
industry focus

485
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,800
uh work um in that this this point of

486
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,880
naming the hackers was not really seen

487
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,279
as

488
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,360
a good approach at all it just was not

489
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,639
seen this kind of idea of

490
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,639
playing victim wasn't seen as a good

491
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,920
approach and actually

492
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,120
uh didn't do companies well in the media

493
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,199
the third one looking at this this point

494
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,160
about uh

495
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,040
looking at trying to put active uh

496
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,199
measures in place so if a breach occurs

497
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,120
thinking clearly about what are the type

498
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,040
of ways in which you can actually

499
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,920
secure individuals uh data whether it's

500
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,440
credit monitoring whether it's

501
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,279
implementing to a factor authentication

502
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,440
anything like that but i can ensure

503
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,279
that firstly you're communicating to

504
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,120
customers and stakeholders what you're

505
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,880
doing to resolve and to deal with the

506
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,519
breach

507
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,279
and then secondly to actually ensure

508
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,800
that they're aware that you're trying to

509
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,480
prioritize their protection

510
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,560
that's very very important and then the

511
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,320
last point um and this this is probably

512
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,839
the most contentious of the point so i'm

513
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,199
sure many of you will probably catch up

514
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,480
with me later

515
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,440
uh to discuss in the in the in the q a

516
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,800
um on the website

517
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,440
um this point about so we advertise this

518
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,639
kind of or

519
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,480
i should say that the industry where i

520
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,760
could um

521
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,600
um advocates rather um notifying

522
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,680
customers and stakeholders soon rather

523
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,639
than later

524
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,040
so not taking weeks notify but notifying

525
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,000
sooner rather than later

526
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,680
and i'll come on to the reason for this

527
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,479
a bit later

528
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,079
so now what we did was of course we have

529
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,680
two sets of best practices we have

530
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,440
academic best practice we have industry

531
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,360
best practice what should we do

532
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
so in many cases what was great was that

533
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,199
academic industry best practice actually

534
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,800
aligned perfectly so we were able to

535
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,240
kind of take these two things

536
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,199
and combine them um then we also had

537
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,399
cases where uh

538
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,320
there were cases where there were

539
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,600
different things that were

540
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,320
were so we had some from academics some

541
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,600
from non-academic that we were able to

542
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,560
combine

543
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,800
and then we also had um communication

544
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,680
and messaging

545
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,120
and then the last point was there's some

546
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,959
areas with that actually didn't map well

547
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,000
so communication

548
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
didn't map with um so sorry on the left

549
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,199
uh academics of recommending that um

550
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,360
maybe blaming the attacker industry and

551
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,480
best practice meaning

552
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,320
suggesting that's not a great thing so

553
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,680
in those cases we'd basically try to

554
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,959
pick one that we thought had the

555
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,160
strongest argument and we went for

556
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,040
example for assets responsibility

557
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,480
so from that work we came with an

558
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,320
initial framework as you can see here

559
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,720
but then what we did quickly was we kind

560
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,000
of showed a number of kind of key

561
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,199
stakeholders and what

562
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,839
we did was we tried to engage with them

563
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,199
and we tried to

564
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,199
get their feedback into the into the

565
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,240
research

566
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,000
and here you can see a number of the

567
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,279
individuals well

568
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,199
they're anonymized data so we had 13

569
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,880
individuals but we had individuals that

570
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,079
were kind of very senior in

571
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:32,800
organizations

572
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,639
chief risk officers head of information

573
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,360
security sees those directors and so on

574
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,199
uh and these were all these were largely

575
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,199
from security organizations and you can

576
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,120
see some quite large organizations

577
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,120
but also we have some some key people in

578
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,040
goal involved in

579
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,560
crisis response so people that you

580
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,480
actually get to call in in cases when

581
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,120
there is actually a breach

582
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,279
and so we refine the framework based on

583
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,120
that and the framework now is what i'm

584
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,639
going to encourage

585
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,720
you through now um so there are a number

586
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,639
of kind of key areas or key steps of the

587
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,680
framework

588
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,359
um there is i've broke it down into kind

589
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,119
of two main areas there is one

590
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,799
which is pre-event so what you should

591
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,480
what you should do before an event

592
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,359
occurs

593
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,160
and then secondly there is a post event

594
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,079
so in the pre-event setup

595
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,359
what we do is we have um

596
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,280
we have uh a number of key things you

597
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,199
need to establish so you need to

598
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,240
establish

599
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,599
um you need to start you need to

600
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,839
consider what are your priorities after

601
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,160
this

602
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,280
occurs we need to consider um

603
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,640
what are the gaps you need to consider

604
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,880
and maintain communication you need to

605
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,559
look at incorporating partners

606
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,520
and performing regular testing

607
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,559
and um let's see

608
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,799
uh and this basically just jumps into

609
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,320
that in a bit more detail but i'm just

610
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,919
giving you a wizard's top tour because

611
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,480
all this

612
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,960
you know is available to you offline um

613
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,720
so this is kind of in general pre-event

614
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,480
what what's needed

615
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,840
um and this is more information on

616
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,760
pre-event what's needed so in terms of

617
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,360
the the partners the communication

618
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,919
rehearsals and so on

619
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,440
then in terms of the actual curses

620
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,679
response we also have a number of

621
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,960
different things you need to consider so

622
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,480
you need to consider

623
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,679
you know if a breach happens is

624
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,000
disclosure mandatory um

625
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,240
what do you need to consider um

626
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,919
establish what we need to disclose

627
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,360
and and so on so these are some of the

628
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,399
key key points

629
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,919
there's also the framing the message so

630
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,360
framing the message is already all about

631
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,120
acceptance and responsibility we suggest

632
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,440
avoid downplaying and also other things

633
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,160
such as

634
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,160
taking into account age gender and

635
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,640
different things such as that

636
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,080
and also as we kind of emphasize here

637
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,200
avoid blaming the attackers

638
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,640
we also need to think very carefully

639
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,840
about how you actually choose to

640
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,600
disclose so choose when to disclose and

641
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,039
select how to disclose

642
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,799
so you need to be thinking very clearly

643
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,799
about um

644
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,720
when to disclose so we we often suggest

645
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,200
notify quicker rather than later

646
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,960
because that helps to kind of avoid the

647
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,240
offset of people being actually very

648
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,360
upset

649
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,919
um there's also this idea of direct

650
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,600
versus indirect communication of course

651
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,200
direct communication has many benefits

652
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,360
so for example email has many benefits

653
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,480
and surface mail might have many

654
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,320
benefits but there might also be some

655
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,760
disadvantages to that which you need to

656
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,640
consider

657
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,760
and the same thing for indirect

658
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,679
communication

659
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,360
um as we kind of delve into more detail

660
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,120
here

661
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,480
and then we also have this idea we're

662
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,000
going to prepare for reaction in terms

663
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,799
of you need to brief

664
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,080
stuff there were a number of cases where

665
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,000
staff weren't briefed um that the

666
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,600
message wasn't delivered well so these

667
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,960
are also kind of key things you need to

668
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,640
be thinking about keep it simple avoid

669
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,360
jargon

670
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,640
and so on and this is the

671
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,480
the last slide really um and i just want

672
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,000
to say very briefly that you know this

673
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,600
work has had a really good take up

674
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,840
um and if mission security industry

675
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,120
there's a number of people reached out

676
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,039
we want to look um some rewards for this

677
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:47,919
work as well

678
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,320
so we do believe that there's a massive

679
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,840
impact and massive potential for the

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,400
work

681
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,240
and as much as possible i'm really happy

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,679
kind of workflows that

heard of the

714
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,520
of these two people probably is

715
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,520
completely new to first and new to the

716
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,480
field

717
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,520
um andrus and alexander

718
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,640
have been working or working at circle

719
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,520
under kind of the brains and the engines

720
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,280
not only the brains but also the engines

721
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,000
behind

722
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,880
miss and miss pests developed from

723
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,840
something kind of

724
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,640
an early scene to really a swiss army

725
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,679
knife of

726
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,280
solving a lot of our problems and we're

727
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,880
going to see how it's going to be solved

728
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,679
in some

729
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,440
going to be deployed in something that

730
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,960
you wouldn't really

731
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,799
expect it to be used even though it has

732
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,640
to do with viruses i'm told

733
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,320
without further ado i hand over to you

734
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,880

735
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,200

really pleasure to be here today and uh

740
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,600
a bit sad today because we don't see

741
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,559
each other but

742
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,000
if you have played with the virtual

743
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,320
games of first it's uh you could maybe

744
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,280
see some of us there playing around um

745
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:09,679
so

746
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,559
thank you very much so what we will do

747
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,480
today is to present something that just

748
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,600
happened to us uh

749
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,159
from here some months ago i would say

750
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,240
more than one even a year ago

751
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,720
um about the pandemic and so on and um

752
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,360
for andres and myself who will present

753
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,960
what we did and or we i would say a

754
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,120
change a bit misspent and or we build

755
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,720
the sharing communities around something

756
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,880
that we were not experts in

757
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,799
so it was kind of a challenge for us at

758
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,400
the beginning um

759
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,120
so we we came by creating a kind of

760
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,960
covet 19 mr information sharing

761
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,760
community

762
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,559
and it was a kind of uh experimental uh

763
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,360
thing so

764
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,360
uh the session of today for us is uh

765
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,520
an overview of what we did there so

766
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,200
first there's a kind of kicks notes

767
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,400
about

768
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,240
miss for the one that doesn't know miss

769
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,600
but i think it's really very

770
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,000
fast and quick because i think a lot of

771
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,960
the first members

772
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,640
are already familiar with misspen all

773
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,840
the open source products we're working

774
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,159
but we will describe what we did exactly

775
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,559
of of building this community of coming

776
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,080
19 community

777
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,320
um so it's not only only about the

778
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,120
tooling and

779
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,600
all the uh development that we deliver

780
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,120
on the tools but it's

781
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,280
actually the i would say even the

782
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,640
relationship and the creation of the

783
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,480
community around it and uh

784
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,440
we will share uh all the interaction

785
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,799
that we have with the people the

786
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,159
different organizations and so on to

787
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,760
really build the community

788
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,000
um and we want to really share with you

789
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
so we have a short session today of less

790
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,240
than 30 minutes but we will try to

791
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,960
to to show to you what uh what was

792
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,159
really working for us and

793
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,039
what didn't work um so and we really

794
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,039
hope to share some some lesson learned

795
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,320
with you

796
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,120
so it's it's really uh what we

797
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,480
experienced so uh

798
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,799
again we were not expressed in the

799
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,200
pandemic field but uh we became a

800
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,080
in huawei while doing this community

801
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,919
so really the origin of the uh

802
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,559
of this community is like uh i mean it

803
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,840
was like kind of a

804
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,480
i would say reactions uh so for us a lot

805
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,760
of things that we are developing is

806
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,360
based on the fact that

807
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,919
uh when we face an issue or we are

808
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,520
facing or we are frustrated about

809
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,480
something

810
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,200
we want to practically do something

811
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,840
there

812
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,960
uh which is i think for us a kind of off

813
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,600
of resilience to create some tools and

814
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,240
so on

815
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,240
and um as a system as a

816
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,200
day-to-day job we have seen an increase

817
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,720
of this kind of

818
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,960
surface of attack for all those uh

819
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,159
tools services and so on run by people

820
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,600
because they were in a russian they were

821
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,360
starting to like hold out a lot of new

822
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,559
services and

823
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,400
we have seen that it was like growing up

824
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,320
uh at the same time

825
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,960
for everyone as being human i mean we

826
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,640
were facing this uh

827
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,279
this pandemic as a kind of new situation

828
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,240
for for us and i think it was kind of a

829
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,919
new challenge not only on the on the

830
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,919
professional side but on the personal

831
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,039
side too

832
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,400
um and at the same time this kind

833
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,200
of surrounding cows around it a lot of

834
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,159
uh

835
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,000
adversaries threat actors and sons

836
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,520
trying to abuse it so it was kind of

837
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,240
uh challenging and in all this mess of

838
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,640
of people discussing and so on

839
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,000
we have seen a lot of initiatives

840
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,840
popping up about uh

841
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,960
sharing information and so on so i mean

842
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,559
it was kind of selfish for us but we

843
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,400
wanted to have at least

844
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,799
one point at our place where we could

845
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,880
collect the information to use it see

846
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,880
what are the current trend regarding

847
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,080
not only the uh medical aspect but all

848
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,240
the cyber security aspect of this

849
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,080
pandemic

850
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,640
so and we started to discuss with a lot

851
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,320
of people and uh

852
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,960
and we have different interests in

853
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,240
different groups

854
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,039
regarding uh uh potential sharing

855
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:01,840
communities

856
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,960
uh on uh on covet 19. so

857
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,480
that's where everything started so it's

858
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,000
basically the original

859
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,200
thing so we we say okay maybe we should

860
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,720
use misspent uh

861
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,400
uh for the one that doesn't know miss

862
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,480
miss pizza is a platform what we call

863
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,240
nowadays a thread intelligent sharing

864
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,240
platform so really with a strong focus

865
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,679
on the sharing aspect

866
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,039
uh and if we have to summarize the four

867
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,760
key activities of of misspees like

868
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,960
ingesting data processing this data

869
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,279
to to for example strictly in the common

870
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,000
format to

871
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,760
twelve correlations enrichment so it's

872
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,679
basically the classical

873
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,200
trade intelligence process or the

874
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,799
intelligence process of plans that can

875
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,840
be

876
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,200
done using mist and then obviously you

877
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,039
can use it to interact with people to

878
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,480
collaborate contextualize

879
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,640
improve information and then disseminate

880
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,799
information so if you're looking for a

881
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:53,679
platform for

882
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,360
building sharing communities isaac's and

883
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,360
so on is basically the platform that you

884
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,400
you can use it's fully open source um

885
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,240
there are plenty of other things around

886
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,799
miss that we are maintaining

887
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,279
library knowledge base uh many best

888
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,960
practices and nowadays we have even on

889
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,919
the computer

890
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,000
standard for the information sharing

891
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,120
aspect so

892
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,120
everything is open source so there's no

893
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,159
uh hidden

894
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,760
secret there everything can be

895
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,760
accessible modified and turned and by

896
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,039
everyone and

897
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,520
this is basically maintained by us so

898
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,880
that's just a quick introduction of

899
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,919
misspend

900
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,200
what we did there

901
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,919
yeah and a little bit more about that

902
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,120
and there's also the

903
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,760
uh miss vincent's up first so if you're

904
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,200
first members and you're

905
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,600
you're listening as a first member just

906
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,360
authenticate with that and you it will

907
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,960
create a user for you automatically and

908
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,320
you can get started with

909
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,919
it's already a pretty broad sharing

910
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,760
commit with a lot of different users and

911
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,279
organizations on there sharing their

912
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,320
data

913
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,520
there's also something else that might

914
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
be interesting there's

915
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,600
also the information sharing sick where

916
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,440
there's a lot of discussions about

917
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,520
information sharing in general not just

918
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,120
cyber threat information sharing but

919
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,640
also other types of information

920
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,880
so you will see here as well that we

921
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,320
were dealing with different kind

922
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,919
types of information sharing all

923
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,000
together in this scenario

924
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,880
and we and these do come together at one

925
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,240
point we'll talk about that in a moment

926
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,799
though

927
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,559
next time so a little bit about

928
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,279
mist that we also try to do over the

929
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,159
years is

930
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,000
we try to make the tool as flexible as

931
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,600
possible so we started out with this

932
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,200
initial use case that we as a national

933
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,080
c-cert

934
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,240
we're basically working with cyber

935
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,440
security cases

936
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,480
almost entirely so that means that our

937
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,240
background and miss background as well

938
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,320
is i.t security first and foremost

939
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,000
with that said though over the years it

940
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,760
has evolved on being able to host

941
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,039
different types of communities and

942
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,159
different types of information

943
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,480
sharing for example financial fraud

944
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,159
information is being shared in specific

945
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,320
financial

946
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,399
sharing communities you have law

947
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,360
enforcement using it for border control

948
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,080
for monitoring seized goods and for

949
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,399
their forensic cases

950
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,520
you have all these different different

951
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,320
use cases with vulnerability management

952
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,520
and also for risk analysis

953
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,120
so you have a bunch of different types

954
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,039
of users and communities involved and

955
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,399
that means that the data model aligns

956
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,480
itself with these different types of

957
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,159
so we wanted to have this flexibility in

958
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,080
place if you want to see some really

959
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,919
exotic use cases i think the craziest

960
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,520
one we've seen so far was

961
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,720
a sharing community where they were

962
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,279
sharing radar waveforms we have no idea

963
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,640
why but they had

964
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,120
questions for us on how to model their

965
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,720
data and that's how we found out about

966
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,600
it

967
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,799
exactly so

968
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,000
going back to a little bit about the

969
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,600
personal challenges so alex has already

970
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,880
mentioned a little bit about why we

971
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,000
started with this whole thing but there

972
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,360
were also a lot of personal

973
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
uh frustrations for us i mean one of the

974
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,720
most common ones

975
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,480
that i'm sure for all of you is the case

976
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,159
was last year when it came to

977
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,600
conferences like first

978
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,200
are we going to be able to travel there

979
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,120
with kobe 19

980
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,720
what is the situation in giving under

981
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,399
countries where we might give trainings

982
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,000
where we might have to go for our jobs

983
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,600
and so on can we actually travel

984
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,760
are we safe so these kind of questions

985
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,120
were all in our mind basically and

986
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,799
that's why we initially started so the

987
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,320
first use case for the co-vignous

988
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,679
pencils was really the health

989
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:08,799
information

990
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,559
to just see where we stand with the

991
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,240
current pandemic

992
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,320
keep in mind this is early early last

993
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,760
year when they weren't

994
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,440
those fancy dashboards that are out

995
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,520
there now uh all over the place that you

996
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,880
can gather this information from the

997
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,080
ones that were out there

998
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,480
were either very regional like the one

999
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,440
hosted by

1000
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,640
the chinese government which was

1001
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,320
actually really good for regional

1002
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,600
overview

1003
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,760
within china but not so great if you

1004
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,840
wanted to to see for example what was

1005
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,440
happening around luxembourg

1006
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,760
on the other hand uh the ones that

1007
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,360
existed that were good like the one from

1008
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,799
john hopkins at the time didn't have the

1009
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,720
capability to do filtering on only

1010
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,240
regions that you were interested in for

1011
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,600
example so we wanted to have something

1012
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,799
flexible there

1013
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,799
and wanted to put mist to good use and

1014
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,480
test this flexibility whether it was

1015
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,520
really as flexible as we claimed it was

1016
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,440
so first of all we had to overcome

1017
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,919
basically our own doubts and the doubts

1018
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,840
of our surrounding

1019
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,000
about us not having any expertise in

1020
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,960
this field at all

1021
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,880
we knew information sharing so that was

1022
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,240
the thing that we knew so we wanted to

1023
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,760
apply that also to a different domain

1024
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,600
so the first thing that we we decided to

1025
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,760
do is to

1026
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,000
look at admissions or we could track the

1027
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,880
pandemic and

1028
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,919
what we need to modify uh in order to to

1029
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:25,120
get ready and to have

1030
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,760
a covet 19 missed synthetic the first

1031
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,559
thing that we

1032
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,640
need to do is to have a complete new

1033
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,760
data models

1034
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,279
and this complete new data model was

1035
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,240
super simple as unrush mentioned we

1036
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,399
we have this flexible modeling mix that

1037
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,919
we are using for a lot of things and

1038
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,080
so the thing is know that you can

1039
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,080
describe in the data model

1040
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,559
uh the health information because we

1041
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,080
were capturing a lot of things really

1042
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,760
staging cyber security

1043
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,760
and so on but not the health-related

1044
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,279
information

1045
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,039
and another thing that we were looking

1046
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,960
for was finding the good data sources

1047
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,159
and a way to ingest them so for

1048
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:00,880
empowered genomes

1049
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,120
into one where one of the very good data

1050
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,919
sources

1051
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,919
uh and we were building scripture only

1052
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,279
to be able to inject

1053
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,399
the data and then there is this

1054
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,919
visualization aspect like anash was

1055
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,279
mentioning i think it was quite

1056
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,399
important at the early beginning there

1057
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:14,880
were not

1058
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,720
that much dashboard that you can

1059
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,919
customize uh

1060
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,679
for example change input the time series

1061
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,279
and so on uh easily

1062
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,919
um so we wanted to change that in mist

1063
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,760
so uh

1064
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,159
and we have to modify other things so we

1065
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,360
set up miss

1066
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,600
uh as at the beginning so we were like

1067
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,880
thinking that we were

1068
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,760
maybe only 10 or 20 people around it uh

1069
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,559
but we are

1070
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,000
there's a constant growth of users from

1071
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,240
the

1072
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,760
beginning we have some statistics later

1073
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,080
that you will see um so we have to to

1074
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,039
manage that

1075
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,320
uh so we even uh extend a bit miss to

1076
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,519
support that kind of thing we will see

1077
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,799
that later

1078
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,240
another thing that you are very

1079
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,559
important to is to be able to manage

1080
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,200
this kind of group properly and to

1081
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,880
assign them to the proper organization

1082
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,000
and front

1083
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,039
another thing that we we have seen is we

1084
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:03,440
have

1085
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,919
to create what we call those kind of

1086
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,440
allo list

1087
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,519
and what was kind of kind of positive

1088
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,039
for that we have seen around uh

1089
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,320
the 2019 situation and so on is a lot of

1090
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,480
new domain names were popular somewhere

1091
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,640
governmental somewhere private society

1092
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,519
somewhere

1093
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,960
scam so and all you did was discuss

1094
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,720
all those one it was quite difficult so

1095
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,399
that was the thing that we

1096
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,880
uh we have to do too and we were

1097
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,720
basically reusing some of the activities

1098
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,519
around that

1099
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,559
uh to have some somalis um

1100
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,799
so the two main thing that we did with

1101
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:37,679
uh to

1102
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,880
build our own connectors to gather two

1103
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,519
mains as related sources don't forget it

1104
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,080
was at the

1105
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,039
beginning of the pandemi and only the

1106
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,559
two data sources were available and

1107
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,159
possible and so on was jonathan's

1108
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,399
asset and the chinese is developmentally

1109
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,919
important

1110
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,799
so we design new object templates for

1111
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,240
those and for the one that are familiar

1112
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,080
with like straight forward to do and you

1113
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,720
see that

1114
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,559
it was like kind of force a quick queen

1115
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,080
because you were able to reuse that

1116
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,799
model

1117
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,840
to just create the json format and we

1118
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,440
create some additional feed in gesture

1119
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,520
so we have this capability in this print

1120
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,639
ingest feed for any kind of data

1121
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,199
and it was reporting that so just an

1122
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,119
example here it's one of those

1123
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,800
object templates that we modify in miss

1124
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,879
but it's something that we remember we

1125
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,000
we did that uh during a military

1126
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,918
training that we did in brussels

1127
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,320
uh so we were two doing the training and

1128
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,839
at the same time we were working on the

1129
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,119
project

1130
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,239
and we basically do those uh

1131
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,480
object templating in the kind of i would

1132
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,599
say one hour

1133
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,199
uh and we were structuring the covet 19

1134
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,839
daily report from jonathan into a

1135
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:48,480
standardized misformality and it was

1136
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,000
like a kind of quick way to have those

1137
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,199
kind of

1138
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,839
object templates

1139
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,599
yeah going back to what we actually lack

1140
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:58,880
to at this point was really the

1141
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,800
dashboarding system

1142
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
so one of the things that that we wanted

1143
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,560
to have is something first of all that

1144
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,160
we can reuse later on for other use

1145
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,680
cases obviously everything that we did

1146
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,480
was

1147
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,920
was also to to still be somehow attached

1148
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,920
to what we do day to day normally

1149
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,599
we also wanted to have a system where it

1150
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,960
was easy to build

1151
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,000
and to to uh to manage the different

1152
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,800
widgets that

1153
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,240
that we would create for the different

1154
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,800
use cases managing a sense also that

1155
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,599
users would

1156
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,040
would be able to customize how these

1157
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,599
widgets worked based on configurations

1158
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,920
based on settings that they set up

1159
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,000
so for example for the kobe 19 case in

1160
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,200
particular

1161
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,920
uh i myself am hungarian i'm living in

1162
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,839
germany and i'm working in luxembourg

1163
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,440
so obviously these three countries were

1164
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,040
of high interest to me so

1165
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,320
that means that if i'm looking at the

1166
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,760
dashboard these are the numbers that i'm

1167
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,280
most interested in most likely and

1168
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,200
perhaps the other neighboring countries

1169
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,720
so i would want to create something that

1170
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,680
is catered to my own personal needs

1171
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,800
and the other thing that you wanted is

1172
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,160
you wanted to have something that that

1173
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,240
adheres to the rules of the relativity

1174
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,119
model of mist

1175
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,400
so the idea was that you wanted to be

1176
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,760
able to share this dashboard to all

1177
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,920
other users of the fms community

1178
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,599
and they would be able to retrieve only

1179
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,560
the statistics and overview of data that

1180
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,240
they had access to in the first place

1181
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,960
from from their user perspective

1182
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,720
next time please so here's just a small

1183
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,560
image of what uh what the kovid 19

1184
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,720
dashboard looks like so again this is

1185
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,640
very customized for the kovin 19

1186
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,160
instance obviously if you're

1187
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,119
doing cyber threat intelligence you will

1188
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,640
have different types of widgets

1189
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,200
to pick from that make more sense but

1190
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,880
for this it made a lot of sense for us

1191
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,599
we could create uh regional hot zones

1192
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,560
basically by uh

1193
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,599
uh the geo view

1194
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,040
of the data we could uh see numbers such

1195
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,240
as mortalities

1196
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,480
confirmed cases recoveries and so on and

1197
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,680
track those numbers in the various

1198
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,560
different countries

1199
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,640
this was at the time when these numbers

1200
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,079
really played a role in where

1201
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,400
you were allowed to travel for example

1202
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,119
all together

1203
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,560
and then later on of course everything

1204
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,320
came to a grinding hold but at the

1205
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,680
at first i think we were a bit more

1206
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,200
optimistic uh when we came up with this

1207
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,640
next slide face so

1208
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,480
to put this into perspective uh this

1209
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,920
entire thing for us

1210
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,079
it was kind of a passion project that we

1211
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,079
mostly did outside of working hours so

1212
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,680
weekends and evenings and we ended up

1213
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,040
implementing everything that we needed

1214
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,800
for this first vision of what we wanted

1215
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,440
to do

1216
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,160
within two weekends and a few additional

1217
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,200
evenings and

1218
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,640
we were actually quite surprised by how

1219
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,880
well it worked we just put the tweet out

1220
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,400
if anyone's interested they can join us

1221
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,240
and what we didn't expect was the

1222
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,320
flow of users that we received so we had

1223
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,560
a massive influx of users

1224
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,880
which immediately brought uh with itself

1225
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,160
additional issues that we didn't

1226
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,280
anticipate

1227
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,280
for example managing user accounts and

1228
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,560
giving access to miss

1229
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,400
in general is normally something that we

1230
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,440
tied to a more formal process in general

1231
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,760
in other communities here this was not

1232
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,359
the case so we wanted to give access to

1233
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,119
anyone that was interested in the data

1234
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,560
and we wanted to have something that is

1235
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,960
quick uh in order to registering this so

1236
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,440
we need

1237
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,359
a self-registration system that was

1238
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,400
obvious otherwise we would get

1239
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,440
overloaded

1240
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,599
and you needed to rely on or on

1241
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:06,960
organizations and and

1242
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,440
for users to manage themselves and their

1243
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,760
and give access to their peers and so on

1244
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,920
so we basically switched to using org

1245
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,760
admins wherever we could in this case

1246
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,000
for those familiar with

1247
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,560
that's basically it yeah quick example

1248
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,480
of the self-registration and this one

1249
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:22,960
was

1250
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,280
was for us a quick queen because uh we

1251
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,960
were there night working on different

1252
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,760
projects and

1253
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,079
during the evening working on that we

1254
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,480
could not handle all the requests so as

1255
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,480
mentioned was mentioning it was like a

1256
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,640
content constant flow of

1257
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,520
user requests uh willing to register so

1258
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,359
now you have this kind of of simple

1259
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,520
self-registration scheme and again it's

1260
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,040
a very good cell i would say

1261
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,960
a lesson learn for information sharing

1262
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,880
communities if you give an easy access

1263
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,839
to your community

1264
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,440
you will get more people and more people

1265
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,839
are involved and for us at the end

1266
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,000
introducing such kind of new features

1267
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,359
help us to uh

1268
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,119
to open this kind of functionality to

1269
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,480
other sharing communities where they

1270
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,200
have a very

1271
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,760
i would say lacks or easy access to

1272
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,680
specific sharing communities

1273
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,520
um so who was initially interested and

1274
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,000
initially we were interested to people

1275
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,400
that have information about the

1276
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,040
health related information and so on um

1277
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,079
so we we get

1278
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,800
a lot of people that were initially uh

1279
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,800
interested into this kind of dashboard

1280
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,720
and seeing the evolution and so on but

1281
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,160
over the times we see that those

1282
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,079
information sharing communities were a

1283
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,680
better host structure so that means the

1284
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,359
dashboard about health and so

1285
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,760
perhaps everywhere they were more

1286
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,720
coordinated

1287
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,960
either at worldwide level european level

1288
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,920
and so on

1289
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,680
so we have seen a kind of off-shift over

1290
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,599
the times where

1291
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,839
different kinds of activities or at

1292
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,960
least topics

1293
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,440
were shared one of these is basically us

1294
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,240
related obviously but

1295
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,079
knowing your bizarre backgrounds cyber

1296
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,599
trade and cyber security related

1297
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,720
information was

1298
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,440
something that were like popping up more

1299
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,000
and then

1300
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,720
uh two of the topics were very common

1301
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,119
and

1302
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,280
started to really uh take over was a

1303
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,040
disinformation aspect because during a

1304
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,880
specific period of time

1305
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,560
we have seen a lot of these information

1306
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,520
before that information i think has been

1307
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,599
widely distributed and more people have

1308
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:14,960
access to the knowledge about

1309
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,880
the pandemic and so on a lot of this

1310
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,400
information was sent and this kind of

1311
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,359
information

1312
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,680
were shared within that community and

1313
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,960
then another thing that a lot of people

1314
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,760
were looking for

1315
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,480
was the official website to disambiguate

1316
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:26,800
the

1317
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,960
website from the government from the one

1318
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,040
at our north governmental one and that's

1319
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,440
those we say four main categories with

1320
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,400
the main pillar

1321
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,960
of information that we were sharing

1322
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,520
there

1323
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,359
um just a quick graph and this one is

1324
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,640
interesting because

1325
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,680
you really quickly see

1326
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,240
a huge peak of of request at the early

1327
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,280
beginning

1328
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,319
so we had like around 60

1329
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,040
70 people requesting access on a daily

1330
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,400
basis at the early beginning and

1331
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,119
sometimes

1332
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,000
it was like a lot of people were asking

1333
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,960
for requests

1334
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,920
then he has kind of closed on over the

1335
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,960
time

1336
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,720
and this one is interesting what we have

1337
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,319
seen is the continuous

1338
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,800
request of access recently we have seen

1339
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,480
some organizations saying that they will

1340
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,280
stop providing fees about covet 19 and

1341
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:13,920
so on

1342
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,000
um but we still see continuous interest

1343
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,359
for various reasons we don't know what

1344
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:18,800
will be the steps in the next month

1345
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,680
which i think

1346
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,680
it's logical another thing that we have

1347
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,280
seen is a lot of academics and

1348
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,319
researchers

1349
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,440
were interested to access the system to

1350
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,720
see an overall um

1351
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,359
historical database and data set so we

1352
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:32,880
still give access to the

1353
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,319
19 myths for instance um we we

1354
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,079
still give access to many people and

1355
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,400
organizations and especially we

1356
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,240
were surprised to see a more and more

1357
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,079
academic researcher

1358
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,000
getting access and using the data for

1359
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,800
more research

1360
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,800
yeah so with that said let's talk a

1361
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,000
little bit about these different use

1362
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,440
cases and why they were interested in

1363
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,800
what they were looking for

1364
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,720
so starting with the health use case

1365
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,000
from the from the get go

1366
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,680
this was the one that initially drove

1367
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,680
like the numbers of people to join the

1368
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,880
instance initially

1369
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,440
so again we were interested in travel

1370
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,319
times about

1371
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,240
the risks that we were exposed to and so

1372
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,800
on uh but over time this became a lot

1373
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,560
less relevant so this was interesting in

1374
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,440
the beginning for

1375
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,599
for the community when there was nothing

1376
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,280
else in place but later on you had all

1377
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,960
these really good national dashboards

1378
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,480
and so on that you had

1379
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,560
uh they provided way more information by

1380
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,880
having more data sources than us

1381
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,960
so for example later on one of the the

1382
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,160
things that became most

1383
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,240
interesting was a number of vaccinations

1384
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,599
this year for example

1385
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,040
so this is something where national

1386
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,800
registers have the best information as

1387
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,680
opposed to

1388
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,359
these global ones like the ones that we

1389
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,119
were using for uh

1390
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,480
for for the incident cases

1391
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,400
so this changed a little bit over time

1392
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,839
and we

1393
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,839
dropped the shift for uh the focus on

1394
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,000
this uh over time to focus more on the

1395
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,560
other

1396
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,319
pillars with that said there was still a

1397
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,599
lot of information shared

1398
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,680
articles reports about the topic and so

1399
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,119
on so it means that there's something

1400
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,480
interesting you popped up there was

1401
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,240
someone pushing data about it

1402
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,160
in the community so those interests

1403
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,160
could still follow up on that data

1404
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,799
next time please

1405
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,520
alex

1406
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,000
i think we might have lost alex or

1407
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,400
myself

1408
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:27,839
alex are you there

1409
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:44,078
hello did i disconnect alex disconnect

1410
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,319
yeah he seems to have disconnected okay

1411
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:48,720
uh

1412
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,480
in that case no worries um

1413
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,480
i can just share my screen and we can

1414
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,800
continue from there

1415
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,599
just one moment

1416
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,400
apologies internet is not playing along

1417
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,720
today

1418
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,280
do i share my screen there we go

1419
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,920
can you see it yes it's working okay

1420
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,960
perfect

1421
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,000
now i just need to figure out how to go

1422
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,119
into

1423
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,640
full display mode here um full screen on

1424
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,280
there we go

1425
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,400
okay so where are we sorry about that so

1426
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,160
let's continue where we left off

1427
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,240
so going to the other pillar uh talking

1428
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,760
about the cyber threat information

1429
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,480
sharing

1430
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,839
obviously um one of the biggest changes

1431
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,319
that we saw was the change to remote

1432
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,079
work for a lot of organizations which

1433
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,280
basically meant that

1434
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,440
at the moment you have remote work it

1435
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,319
means that you're

1436
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,480
setting up new infrastructures for vpn

1437
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,599
and so on and

1438
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,280
attackers started abusing this really

1439
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,640
heavily at the start

1440
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,400
so obviously when your remote work

1441
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,960
transformation project is led by kovid

1442
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,359
19 as its project manager

1443
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,280
then you're going to end up making

1444
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,040
mistakes and things get more rushed

1445
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,800
then normally something like this would

1446
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,800
happen at the organization

1447
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,319
so with those new attack surfaces in

1448
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,079
place uh basically

1449
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,760
uh we wanted to have some way of

1450
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,520
informing and mitigating these sort of

1451
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,640
issues

1452
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,240
uh so this is more aligned with our

1453
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,920
traditional use case of mist again the

1454
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,480
different

1455
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,760
organizations involved were cesar

1456
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,839
researchers there were a lot of good

1457
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,359
communities popping up

1458
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,040
specifically to to target to to combat

1459
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,599
the situation like cti league was really

1460
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,359
great with uh pushing out a lot of good

1461
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:44,480
information

1462
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,000
out there and there were a lot of

1463
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,240
vendors as well that were integrating

1464
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,240
with the kobe 19 data that we had as

1465
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,920
well and that were feeding on the data

1466
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,720
to

1467
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,440
produce it further and to uh to uh to

1468
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,520
share it further with their customers

1469
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,760
so it was an interesting uh change

1470
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,280
russians at the time

1471
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,359
also for this information campaigns we

1472
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,000
saw quite a bit of uptake

1473
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,520
especially early on when all these

1474
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,960
different campaigns up with

1475
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,079
anti-max

1476
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,880
march marches then later on the

1477
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,760
anti-baxter movements and so on

1478
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,880
kovi denials and so forth and often

1479
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,920
there was a lot a

1480
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,440
political motivation behind this and uh

1481
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,119
there was a there's a community called

1482
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,720
the coxsack collaborative that was

1483
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,800
putting a lot of research in this

1484
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,560
and they basically also started sharing

1485
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,040
information i had the covet instance so

1486
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,319
if you're interested that there's a link

1487
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:35,680
there i highly recommend everyone to

1488
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,960
have a look at what they do it's really

1489
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,079
interesting stuff

1490
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,880
they ended up also implementing a lot of

1491
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,560
additional things for bisp such as

1492
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,000
templates for uh for social media

1493
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,079
information sharing so information

1494
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,920
sharing about social media accounts

1495
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,119
posts and so on

1496
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,720
so all these things are now modeled and

1497
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,839
misspen can be used for other use cases

1498
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:56,079
too

1499
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,200
alex i see you're back yeah yeah i'm so

1500
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,160
sorry so

1501
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,400
guys don't kick me out um so this

1502
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,599
information um

1503
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,800
so we had a lot of group and sean rush

1504
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,240
was mentioning clock say group where

1505
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,920
they were like contributing quite a lot

1506
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,800
and and

1507
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,680
we have seen a lot of some early

1508
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,520
disinformation campaign and um

1509
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,880
i don't really want to talk that much

1510
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,040
about this transmission campaign here

1511
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,480
but just to show you

1512
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,839
that people were actively using a

1513
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:23,920
functionality mist

1514
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,880
that were used for forensic analysis for

1515
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,720
this information so you see a timeline

1516
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,920
of all the

1517
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,040
activities of this campaign

1518
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,960
using the timeline activities of the

1519
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,319
post and so on

1520
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,240
which basically is the functionality

1521
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,599
that we haven't missed for the forensic

1522
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:40,640
analysis so

1523
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,760
uh we were quite quite happy to see uh

1524
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,960
reuse of

1525
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,119
existing functionalities in the system

1526
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,119
uh for finding this out

1527
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,760
on the next slide please

1528
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,599
um same with the operation gridlock and

1529
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,280
this one is interesting so if you have

1530
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,280
access to the commitment uh

1531
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,559
if you want to have a look at the data

1532
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,280
set there um we see that there's a lot

1533
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:03,920
of

1534
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,680
of link between different groups and so

1535
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,280
on and you can really create this kind

1536
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,119
of story behind

1537
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,520
so we have this this capabilities in

1538
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,960
this to

1539
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,960
connect the dots and and connect those

1540
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,240
different objects

1541
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,960
that have been created for example by a

1542
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,720
different group of this information

1543
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,800
uh talking about this information and so

1544
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,800
on and you can really see the story the

1545
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,920
complete story of

1546
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,359
what is operation gridlock what they are

1547
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,280
trying to do and so on uh by just

1548
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,880
looking at what single event and you see

1549
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,839
the overall

1550
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,520
story behind and that's that's quite

1551
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,960
interesting to see that you can really

1552
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,240
use the technology using trade

1553
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,359
intelligence

1554
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,079
for describing other course of actions

1555
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:41,359
and not only

1556
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,359
attacks but uh disinformation for

1557
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:44,480
example

1558
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,440
next slide same with correlation this

1559
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,480
one is a

1560
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,760
an interesting one for for u.s members

1561
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,200
at first there

1562
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,160
it's a correlation between a specific

1563
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,760
disinformation campaign

1564
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,839
and specifically with the account of

1565
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:02,880
regina so you can really see the

1566
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,800
correlation between some acts or as well

1567
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,359
like

1568
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,119
actively pushing information about this

1569
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,040
information and you can really benefit

1570
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,160
from the correlation

1571
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,079
automatically and you see this kind of

1572
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,920
thing another thing that we have seen

1573
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,720
over the time

1574
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,240
in the commit 19

1575
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,040
is this kind of overlap and your hybrid

1576
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,079
stuff coming up

1577
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,079
over the time next slide

1578
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,000
yeah so yeah so just

1579
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
something else that came as a as a side

1580
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,200
note to this

1581
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,640
one of the things that we initially

1582
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,319
found out was that a lot of good

1583
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,160
resources were being blocked by the

1584
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,920
various different security vendors

1585
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,680
because initially there was such an

1586
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,319
abuse of the kobe 19 situation anything

1587
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:46,720
with kovid 19 in domain that was unknown

1588
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,079
basically for security vendors was

1589
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,680
physically blocked a lot of tools and

1590
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,559
devices

1591
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,079
but this was causing issues because you

1592
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:53,839
are blocking legitimate resources from

1593
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:54,960
your governments

1594
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,480
from your various different agencies

1595
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,319
that are there to inform

1596
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:00,960
the community so one of the the initial

1597
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,800
efforts that started up was basically

1598
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,160
including a lot of these different

1599
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,280
sources as

1600
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,200
what we call warning lists and missed so

1601
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,880
basically these are listed that

1602
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,839
of known goods that allow you to block

1603
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,680
those from being fat your different

1604
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,680
protective tools so there are several

1605
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,520
several really good efforts this there

1606
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,079
was a

1607
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:20,079
one from cti leak that was very

1608
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,240
comprehensive uh clasimier's list was

1609
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,359
really useful for

1610
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,680
for detecting a lot of these known goods

1611
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,680
and excluding those from the exports so

1612
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,119
there was quite a few efforts around

1613
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:31,359
this as well

1614
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,359
now a little bit uh quickly about some

1615
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,440
of the statistics that we've seen over

1616
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,440
at the course of this little experiment

1617
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,800
we ended up with 1

1618
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,079
600 users from over 300 organizations

1619
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,160
uh with over 10 000 separate data

1620
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,839
packages being shared with health

1621
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:46,800
related cyber

1622
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,119
security disinformation and so on with

1623
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,440
3.5 million data points all together

1624
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,520
and with a crazy amount of peak traffic

1625
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,559
so during the

1626
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:56,400
the first few months last year we had 15

1627
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,920
terabytes of traffic of just

1628
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,839
uh mis intercommunicating with each

1629
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,000
other so it was pretty heavy

1630
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,640
uh as for the uh shift in the different

1631
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,559
topics we saw initially there was a

1632
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,400
massive uptake of all three domains

1633
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,640
basically

1634
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,760
but with this info being much more

1635
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,079
important than nowadays barely making it

1636
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:17,119
to

1637
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,599
the platform uh in last year so this

1638
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:20,400
also showed that

1639
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,319
that there was this heavy disinformation

1640
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:24,079
campaigns leading up to separate

1641
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,800
political events as well as well as so

1642
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,000
as also

1643
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,040
uh there being less uh good

1644
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,319
communication from the

1645
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,800
government and so on about some of those

1646
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,559
facts that could be abused by

1647
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,400
by simply the uh the people not knowing

1648
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,359
about

1649
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:44,480
uh what's safe what to avoid are masks

1650
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,680
really important and so on

1651
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,680
so alex yeah so see the reminder of sir

1652
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,040
that you have to come in the end so it's

1653
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,520
really

1654
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,200
the conclusion there um so um

1655
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,000
it's easy and straightforward to be

1656
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
honest to set up a new topical socialing

1657
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,839
community

1658
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:06,480
and if you start with very small rules

1659
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,839
in a very light way of

1660
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:10,960
integration rules it's it can be very

1661
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,079
very inclusive community the thing is

1662
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:15,599
it's very interesting to see that those

1663
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:16,880
different groups

1664
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,800
pop pop-up at different basis at

1665
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,720
regional level local level

1666
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,839
international level and the thing is for

1667
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:24,640
us it was

1668
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,200
like a huge interesting experiment to

1669
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,240
get a lot of

1670
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,880
information or to improve the platform

1671
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,880
for me for example for us it was a

1672
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,200
kind of playground and laboratories to

1673
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,040
test new things and to evaluate for the

1674
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,319
dashboard for example

1675
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:41,119
self-registration and so on and for us

1676
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,520
being open software really a quick way

1677
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,200
to adapt our tools

1678
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,240
very quickly and efficiently and have to

1679
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,359
really test base with with all those new

1680
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:52,480
users

1681
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,400
and we have seen over the time this

1682
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,760
overlap between different communities

1683
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,559
because a lot of them are interconnected

1684
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,800
uh thing that was a bit challenging and

1685
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,400
cause issue for us it's uh

1686
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,559
uh initially we we wanted to group

1687
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,319
everyone into a kind of a common group

1688
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:09,599
and organizations

1689
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,400
um but at the end it was better to have

1690
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,480
a kind of specific trust user

1691
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,599
per organization so we connected we

1692
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,520
move those users into kind of groups

1693
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,119
then we were able to

1694
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,920
get kind of kind of organization-based

1695
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,359
uh management

1696
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:26,640
so we had some abuse at the beginning

1697
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,559
but not much

1698
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,200
so we we had this kind of issue at the

1699
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,800
beginning where the

1700
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,640
taxonomy were not properly used or the

1701
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,000
classification of the data weren't

1702
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,760
properly used

1703
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,720
but when we started to involve people to

1704
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,839
create the taxonomy

1705
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:44,240
to clearly set the data they were doing

1706
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,200
the

1707
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,960
classification properly from the early

1708
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,720
on and it was like a good move

1709
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,960
so the thing is at the beginning we had

1710
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,040
like a huge

1711
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,440
urge of people joining and so on and for

1712
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,800
for us we were like

1713
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,800
fixing stuff and increasing and creating

1714
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,720
new features at the same time so we

1715
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,240
might have lost some people at the early

1716
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,000
beginning so it may be something to take

1717
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,920
into consideration if you build

1718
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,000
from scratch a community when when

1719
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,760
there's a urge or an agency to do it

1720
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:19,520
yeah next slide so i think the the best

1721
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,559
thing that we can say is

1722
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,319
initially and for us it was like kind of

1723
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:23,680
a challenge

1724
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,280
you should not be afraid to really step

1725
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,800
out of your comfort zone if you create a

1726
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,559
sharing community

1727
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,760
don't uh be worried to be agile

1728
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,559
and try to support new type of threat

1729
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,160
initially we know we're not experts in

1730
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,440
that field

1731
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,880
but if you look at building cats for

1732
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,480
example they were not experts in some

1733
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,760
fields but at the end they became

1734
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,799
experts in their

1735
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:45,920
own specific field so if you start to be

1736
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,280
involved and work in the sharing

1737
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,319
communities you can

1738
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,160
you start to learn and get more

1739
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,000
information so

1740
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,839
removing specific controls provides

1741
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,200
freedoms and people were

1742
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,480
able to collaborate and share

1743
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,400
information especially when you have an

1744
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,359
agency

1745
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:02,319
people start to to be i would say in

1746
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,480
good mood to operate

1747
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,880
so the thing is if you bootstrap

1748
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,480
technically it's feasible but

1749
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,359
don't forget about the law that you

1750
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,799
might have on the community management

1751
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,240
aspect is really key and really

1752
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,839
important if you want to operate one

1753
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,839
so the thing is it's quite interesting

1754
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:21,839
to see that dynamic sharing communities

1755
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:23,680
might move into different fields very

1756
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,319
quickly

1757
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:26,799
uh so you have to cope with that uh and

1758
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:28,559
it's especially in such kind of

1759
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,880
situations it might you see

1760
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,040
the topic or the threat might evolve

1761
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,799
very very fast even

1762
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,000
in the next month you might have

1763
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,559
different topics and so on um

1764
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:41,599
so miss peace i think we

1765
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,520
have this kind of validation during this

1766
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,000
experiment that it was quite flexible

1767
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,880
we have some serious deficiencies on

1768
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,880
self-registration visualization and tone

1769
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,720
that we overcome during the

1770
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,680
the one year thing so thanks to the i

1771
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,200
would say the pandemic at the end

1772
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,880
it was for us a very good step to to

1773
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,160
to improve the software and have new

1774
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,400
features um

1775
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,480
so and i think the most important part

1776
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,079
and joining what first is doing on a

1777
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:09,200
day-to-day basis

1778
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,079
is really there's a good people uh in

1779
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:13,920
the community willing to assist help

1780
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,400
others and so on and to share so for us

1781
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,839
it was like

1782
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:20,640
i think a good sign of the humanity and

1783
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,839
people are working

1784
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:25,119
for for the good will of everyone

in the community and nicole harris has

1849
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:02,640
worked for

1850
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,440
giant last eight years as a project

1851
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,440
development officer

1852
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:11,040
um which is responsible among other

1853
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,520
activities for tfc cert and the transits

1854
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:14,480
training program

1855
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:18,640
as well as programs um sigita

1856
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,199
yokinaita she will probably kill me for

1857
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:21,679
this

1858
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:25,120
pronunciation is the director of

1859
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:29,280
the rnrd cs security operations center

1860
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,440
she also has a background from giant

1861
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,480
managing

1862
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:35,600
cyber security projects and trainings

1863
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,960
worldwide the talk uh

1864
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:43,440
don't you know that you're toxic um

1865
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,600
i'm very excited about this they will

1866
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,560
highlight

1867
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,320
toxic behavior that renders

1868
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,000
organizations vulnerable and

1869
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,960
how to remedy this so take it away

1870
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:58,400
thank you thank you so hi everybody

1871
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,840
it's really a pleasure to be here with

1872
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,440
you today uh

1873
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,360
as margaret says uh my name is nicole

1874
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,640
harris

1875
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,640
and i'm here with my ex-colleagues

1876
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,719
guitier connecti we were

1877
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:10,640
normally typically known as nikita over

1878
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,320
in the tfc cell world as people couldn't

1879
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,320
remember which one of us was which

1880
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,159
um but we're here to talk to you today

1881
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:18,239
um as margot says about some of the

1882
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,400
toxic behaviors we've seen

1883
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,400
within the security community and how we

1884
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:25,519
can move forward from them

1885
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:29,280
so one of the things that sagitta and i

1886
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,320
both have in common

1887
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,000
um is that we were both humanity

1888
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,080
students uh we studied

1889
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,640
humanities and various different degrees

1890
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,880
and then came into the security and i.t

1891
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:39,840
world through

1892
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,480
rather unusual routes we now between us

1893
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,560
have over 18 years combined experience

1894
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,560
in the security community and security

1895
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:47,600
projects

1896
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,360
as margo said we've led security

1897
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,199
training and coordinated security

1898
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:52,400
training

1899
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,960
programs worldwide we've been

1900
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,640
responsible for managing

1901
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,560
large-scale european projects and

1902
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,640
services in the security space

1903
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,800
and as people most probably know us from

1904
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,960
um we've coordinated diverse security

1905
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,600
communities between us

1906
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,880
so despite of this experience and having

1907
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,719
been in the security world and in the

1908
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:15,440
community for quite a while we still

1909
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,120
feel that because we come from a

1910
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,480
non-traditional background

1911
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,280
and we are both female in a in so in a

1912
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,640
very strong minority with

1913
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:26,640
in this field um we have a unique

1914
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,040
perspective on how the security teams

1915
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,320
and organizations work

1916
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,640
and the things in the security culture

1917
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,360
that can be

1918
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,560
labeled as toxic that we should avoid

1919
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:37,760
so that's exactly what we want to

1920
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:40,159
present on today and we have identified

1921
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,199
10 of these

1922
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:43,839
behaviors

1923
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,360
yep so here are our top 10 toxic

1924
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:48,800
security behaviors

1925
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,320
and we're talking generically about

1926
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,000
security teams but we think these

1927
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,400
all actually relate specifically to see

1928
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,239
certain cert teams as well

1929
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:58,640
um we want to say as well that we have

1930
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:00,880
overwhelmingly found lots of welcome

1931
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,120
in the community um and seen lots of

1932
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,440
really great um

1933
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,800
um but that doesn't mean there's nothing

1934
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,640
that needs to be changed out there so in

1935
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,000
no particular order

1936
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,239
um our top 10 top behaviors that we've

1937
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:13,120
seen

1938
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,600
are security through obscurity the myth

1939
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,880
of meritocracy

1940
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:20,000
hero culture ableist design punitive

1941
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,840
education security silos culture of no

1942
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,560
lack of diversity loser attitude and the

1943
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,080
blame game

1944
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,800
yeah and it's obviously um not that we

1945
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,800
we see that in every organization on

1946
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,760
every team but we think that all of you

1947
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,520
are going to identify at least some of

1948
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:37,840
them

1949
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,880
um from your experience in the current

1950
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:41,520
culture or

1951
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,360
our previous where you were previously

1952
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,880
so what we are hoping

1953
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,360
is that all attendees will see some of

1954
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,960
the behaviors and approaches

1955
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:52,159
that you can you can relate to

1956
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:53,920
and then you will take at least one

1957
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,760
thing home that you can change and

1958
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,960
improve in your organization

1959
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,600
so i'm going to go up first and start

1960
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,679
with the myth of meritocracy

1961
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:06,880
um so the word meritocracy has been used

1962
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,199
for a really long time in our community

1963
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:10,560
and it's typically seen as quite a

1964
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,320
positive force within security and in

1965
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:13,840
the iit industry

1966
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,360
most people seem to have forgotten that

1967
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,040
the person who coined the world

1968
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,880
word his name was michael young he wrote

1969
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,080
an essay called the rise of the

1970
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,280
meritocracy

1971
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,800
he really intended it to describe a

1972
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,880
dystopian future and not something we

1973
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,719
should try and emulate

1974
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:28,320
i was actually introduced to this word

1975
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:30,560
really early on in my iit career

1976
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,080
i was asked to work with a group of men

1977
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,600
who formed a development team for a

1978
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,880
well-used piece of software in the

1979
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,640
higher educational community which i've

1980
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,239
of course not known

1981
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:39,760
and they earnestly spent quite a lot of

1982
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,840
time explaining to me how they accepted

1983
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,199
coders onto the team

1984
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:44,560
on the basis of merit and they were

1985
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,880
really proud to be a meritocracy

1986
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,560
what they were really not able to see

1987
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,159
though was that their judgment of merit

1988
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:51,840
didn't really relate to the code or the

1989
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,679
work being delivered but on the person

1990
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:55,520
type that they wanted on their team

1991
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,120
and that person type was inevitably a

1992
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,040
white man of a certain age with certain

1993
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,679
attitudes and certainly

1994
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:03,120
so the idea that all you need is kind of

1995
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:04,880
talent plus effort to succeed in your

1996
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,640
career has i think by now being well

1997
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,560
disproven despite efforts of some people

1998
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,159
that say all we need to do is lean in

1999
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:12,400
and we'll be just fine and we need to

2000
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,920
talk about privilege privilege is not

2001
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,679
necessarily the presence of money or

2002
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:17,840
power or advantage but rather can simply

2003
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,760
be the abstinence of obstacles and

2004
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,520
the benefits of looking like someone who

2005
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,840
belongs within a community

2006
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,000
and i think our community often strongly

2007
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,239
feels it is a meritocratic space

2008
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:29,760
and that can sometimes be true the

2009
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,280
rituals we go through to build trust

2010
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,960
with each other through organizations

2011
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,960
like first like tfc cert

2012
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,760
do seem to bear this out however even

2013
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:38,960
those who believe that actions and

2014
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,880
reactions are purely based on merit

2015
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,960
can often prioritize and select people

2016
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,320
that most actually mirror

2017
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,400
the dominant group at the time so in

2018
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,760
this process we end up something that

2019
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,360
looks more like a meritocracy than a

2020
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,239
meritocracy

2021
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:51,360
and then the cycle becomes

2022
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,360
self-selecting

2023
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,960
one of the areas where this can become

2024
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,480
most pronounced in recruitment and

2025
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:57,920
there's some simple things we can do to

2026
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:58,960
improve that

2027
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,440
managers often look for someone who fits

2028
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:02,960
in with the existing team and is just

2029
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,480
like the existing team

2030
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,600
and then falls into the trap of

2031
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,120
selecting the same sort of person over

2032
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,480
and over and over again

2033
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,560
and we can do some simple checks um to

2034
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,080
avoid this such as running your

2035
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,320
job um advert through online tools that

2036
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,080
look for balance and look for

2037
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:19,440
um biased terms and um you can actively

2038
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:20,719
consider whether you need a different

2039
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:22,800
and diverse type of person in your team

2040
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,920
rather than another clone i have used

2041
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:28,000
one of those tools recently and i i feel

2042
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:28,560
like

2043
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,719
it was very useful in attracting more

2044
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:31,840
different at

2045
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,560
applicants at least if not employees the

2046
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,280
next thing that we identified that is um

2047
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,280
part of this toxic team culture is the

2048
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,880
so-called hero culture

2049
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,640
and just in general there hasn't been

2050
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:44,159
enough research done on these

2051
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:45,679
toxic team cultures but one of the

2052
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:47,360
people who has been researching this is

2053
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:47,760
uh

2054
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,520
called let's go back

2055
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,640
janan budge from forrester

2056
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:57,840
and in her research she called out ten

2057
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,199
leading causes of toxic

2058
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:01,520
toxicity and one of them was the hero

2059
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:02,719
culture

2060
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:05,040
so um she says that those individuals

2061
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,400
with a hero complex

2062
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,679
um have a very negative um

2063
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:12,719
impact on the team culture so um you

2064
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:13,040
know

2065
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,960
we're talking about the rock stars the

2066
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,800
people who think that they know

2067
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,239
they know it all and they're the only

2068
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:20,400
ones who can solve a problem

2069
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,159
but the real problem is that they're

2070
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:24,719
often not very good team players and

2071
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:27,280
um sadly it's more prevalent than we

2072
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,159
think

2073
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:31,360
um so this this hero culture or having a

2074
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:32,639
hero person

2075
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:35,679
in your organization on your team

2076
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:38,719
leads to two big problems so one of them

2077
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:41,440
is the bottleneck then an employee the

2078
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,400
hero employee

2079
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,400
has a difficulty completing their task

2080
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,560
in a timely and effective manner

2081
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,320
because they simply take on too much

2082
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,920
work thinking that they're the only ones

2083
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,679
who can do it and they don't share the

2084
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:52,960
workload

2085
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,800
but the second thing that is even more

2086
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,560
damaging is that this hero culture is

2087
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,400
the opposite of the team culture which

2088
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,520
we all

2089
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,199
probably agree that is something that we

2090
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:03,120
want to strive for working together in a

2091
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,840
more collaborative way

2092
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,560
so having those heroes create a huge

2093
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:09,840
amount of dysfunction

2094
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,560
in your team or organization the problem

2095
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,760
is that the heroes

2096
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:16,320
often have a fixed mentality they are

2097
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,159
less likely to take risks

2098
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:20,400
because they fear failure which means

2099
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,520
that they cannot learn from their

2100
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,639
mistakes

2101
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:25,360
and what needs to be fostered instead of

2102
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,000
this

2103
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,400
fixed mentality is a growth mentality

2104
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,000
and that can be achieved by

2105
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,080
first of all diversifying your work

2106
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:33,199
workplace

2107
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:36,320
and um putting experience and enthusiasm

2108
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,239
into the mix and you get this enthusiasm

2109
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:38,639
from

2110
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:41,040
new people in the in the field the new

2111
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,239
recruits who have

2112
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:44,560
some skills and capabilities that they

2113
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,560
can bring into your organization

2114
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:49,760
um possibly new ways of thinking

2115
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:53,520
and new ways new ways of communicating

2116
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,000
and new ways of collaborating

2117
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,480
so one of the one of the advice that we

2118
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,040
found

2119
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,040
uh on how to solve this problem is that

2120
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,800
if you have younger employees or

2121
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,520
just say new employees in uh in your

2122
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:06,719
organization

2123
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,960
then um one way of providing those new

2124
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:11,040
perspective and ideas to the hero people

2125
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:14,239
is to um to start

2126
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:16,239
reverse mentoring in your organization

2127
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:17,920
where younger people or new people in

2128
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,760
our organization are mentoring the older

2129
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:20,400
people

2130
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,000
or the people who joined the the

2131
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,840
organization first

2132
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,800
um so our next toxic culture is about

2133
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,800
security through obscurity which is a

2134
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,560
pretty well known phrase we typically

2135
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,080
apply it to approaches that keep the

2136
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,320
inner workings of system secrets

2137
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,400
i think it's pretty widely disproven as

2138
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,480
effective way to keep systems secure

2139
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,880
however it kind of tipped over into

2140
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,400
human behavior as well

2141
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,400
the need to be obscure about projects or

2142
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,480
information related to security teams

2143
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,159
can be an easy sort of knee-jerk

2144
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:51,920
reaction to a perceived notion of

2145
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:52,880
keeping information

2146
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,920
secure we can probably all agree that

2147
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,360
data classification is also

2148
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,040
of course an essential process within an

2149
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,280
organization we always have documents

2150
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:02,800
that certain people should not access

2151
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,480
privileges that certain users should not

2152
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,560
have but that's very different from

2153
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,400
approaches where teams refuse to share

2154
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,199
information

2155
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:11,040
or give users adequate training or

2156
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,639
directions in the belief that keeping

2157
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:14,080
information secret is keeping

2158
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,000
information secure

2159
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,440
this can become even more problematic

2160
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,040
when teams stop communicating

2161
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,360
important information up to managers so

2162
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:23,199
having an excellent communications plan

2163
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:24,719
and actively ensuring that you're

2164
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:26,480
communicating is a key element for any

2165
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,239
kind of team but very specifically for

2166
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:29,360
security teams

2167
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:31,040
while c-sec teams often have really

2168
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:32,960
well-developed communication techniques

2169
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:35,199
dealing with an incident for example

2170
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:36,639
they interact well with trusted

2171
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:38,639
cert teams outside their organization to

2172
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,159
analyze and resolve issues

2173
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:41,920
they can often be quite poor at internal

2174
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,600
communication particularly in terms of

2175
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,800
management engagement

2176
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,120
and user engagement and it's those kind

2177
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,000
of circumstances

2178
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,960
where transparency can be in many senses

2179
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,840
a bigger key to security than secrecy

2180
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,760
to give an example here one of the

2181
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,600
perhaps biggest security failures of the

2182
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,360
20th century was the space shuttle's

2183
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,320
challenger disaster in 1986 and although

2184
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,760
a technical fault was the underlying

2185
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:04,960
cause of the issue

2186
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,880
the investigations into disaster most

2187
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,040
pointed mostly pointed to communication

2188
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,480
issues as the biggest factor in the

2189
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:11,520
fallout

2190
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:14,560
um and the following issues were noted

2191
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:15,760
there was a lack of communication with

2192
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,520
the press which led to unhelpful

2193
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,120
speculation and incorrect information

2194
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,239
becoming facts

2195
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:22,560
and the perceived notion of the public

2196
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:23,840
problems were not communicated or

2197
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,080
discussed outside reporting channels

2198
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:27,760
sign off was permitted without input

2199
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,199
from all of the appropriate teams and

2200
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:30,639
without proper briefings

2201
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:32,080
and information being withheld from

2202
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,760
certain groups of engineers

2203
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:36,159
in the name of security so in this

2204
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:38,159
scenario and in many of the scenarios we

2205
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:39,600
see in our working days

2206
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:40,960
better attention to communication

2207
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,840
planning could quite literally save

2208
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,360
lives

2209
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,760
yeah the next example that we picked is

2210
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:49,280
a punitive education

2211
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,520
and i think that here we're talking

2212
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,120
about training and we all agree that

2213
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,120
security training is very important on

2214
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,719
any budget with no money or

2215
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:58,719
huge budgets but sometimes it can go

2216
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,800
really wrong and a typical scenario

2217
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,520
where we see

2218
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,159
a lot of examples of that is fishing

2219
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:06,880
your own employees not fishing

2220
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:10,400
fishing so in that in that scenario um

2221
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,560
phishing an email is sent some employees

2222
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:13,679
will report it to you

2223
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:16,400
um some will inevitably inevitably click

2224
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:17,199
on the link

2225
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:19,120
and do the wrong thing and then they

2226
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,639
will need to be punished so either you

2227
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:21,920
would be telling them off or

2228
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,400
sending them some power points to look

2229
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:25,199
at or

2230
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:28,239
you know a video about fish fishing and

2231
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:28,639
that

2232
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:30,560
that usually doesn't um doesn't teach

2233
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,000
them anything and it just

2234
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,040
it causes them to be embarrassed and

2235
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,159
humiliated

2236
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:38,239
um one of the recent controversial

2237
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:39,280
examples

2238
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:42,560
that illustrates this very well is from

2239
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:45,360
the uk from best midlands trains who

2240
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,800
emailed

2241
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,199
2 500 employees with a message saying

2242
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:50,800
that they will get a one-off

2243
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:53,679
bonus as a thank you for working really

2244
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:54,080
hard

2245
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:57,360
and during the covet crisis

2246
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,120
however the people who clicked on the

2247
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:01,280
link they got a message

2248
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:03,120
telling them that it was a company

2249
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,719
company organized

2250
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:07,040
phishing simulation test and there was

2251
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,120
not going to be any bonus

2252
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,560
so it just it just told them that this

2253
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,239
was a test designed by their

2254
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:16,320
own organization by their i.t team

2255
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,600
and this was a typical typical phishing

2256
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:20,880
type of link but

2257
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,080
promised financial reward um so

2258
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,560
best midlands defended their their

2259
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,560
actions and their decisions um they said

2260
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,000
that this email was just

2261
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,520
exactly the sort of thing that the

2262
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,520
criminals would would use

2263
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:37,360
um but that kind of uh ex you know that

2264
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,199
that leads to our point that it doesn't

2265
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:40,880
need to be fake we don't need

2266
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:43,120
fake uh emails of phishing emails as we

2267
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,239
get them enough

2268
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:46,400
um as is without our employer actually

2269
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,920
paying someone to create those fake

2270
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:48,719
emails

2271
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,960
and um then some most of the time though

2272
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,800
kind of those kind of campaigns can just

2273
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:53,520
seem

2274
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:56,400
lazy and inconsiderate um if if they're

2275
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:57,840
aiming to train their employees

2276
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,000
in some cases like this one that it's

2277
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,760
actually hurtful and it really caused a

2278
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,600
lot of pain to these people and

2279
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,719
um you know it borderlines hazing rather

2280
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:07,040
than

2281
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:10,159
training so you know if if you want to

2282
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:10,639
teach

2283
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:12,639
your your employees or your colleagues

2284
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:14,080
that you if you click on the link

2285
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,600
or you make a mistake and you're

2286
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,679
embarrassed that's kind of okay

2287
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:19,920
embarrassment is a negative emotion um

2288
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:21,520
and it's a negative emotional response

2289
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:22,800
but it's not as strong as being

2290
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,800
humiliated as you see in this quote

2291
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,400
accumulation is something that is being

2292
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,000
done to you um

2293
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,719
so being humiliated by your own employer

2294
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:32,560
is not going to uh

2295
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,719
you know to lead to you learning

2296
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:36,239
something and being encouraged to

2297
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:38,400
behave in a different way or at least

2298
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,000
not not positively

2299
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,480
so um you know suggestion is to move

2300
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,400
towards training that doesn't involve

2301
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:47,199
huge negative emotions and doesn't hurt

2302
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:48,159
people

2303
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:52,000
um so even if you want to use phishing

2304
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,360
in this in this kind the kind of

2305
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,280
education that's okay but

2306
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,840
it shouldn't be followed by a punishment

2307
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,120
but rather

2308
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,280
encouragement so for example whoever

2309
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,560
reports

2310
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,040
those emails or those links gets a prize

2311
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,080
or some other

2312
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:09,840
gamification uh methods

2313
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,679
thanks sakita um so our next one up is

2314
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:14,960
uh

2315
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:18,639
my slides keep on jumping it's blank

2316
01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:23,840
no i just said no to you no

2317
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,000
and the next one up is the culture of no

2318
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:26,880
um

2319
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,719
so for those of you who have either a

2320
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:30,239
teenager in the house or a toddler in

2321
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:31,280
the house i think you probably get

2322
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,040
enough of the culture of now at home

2323
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,480
um and you don't need it when you go to

2324
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:38,159
work um the quote in the slide is from a

2325
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:40,080
team at the uk government's national

2326
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,360
technical authority

2327
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,760
information assurance try saying that

2328
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:44,719
quickly

2329
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:46,000
um and they say one of the most

2330
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,840
frustrating things we both hear is you

2331
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:48,719
can't do

2332
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:51,199
insert iot thing here for security

2333
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:52,560
reasons

2334
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:54,320
um in the report which we can share with

2335
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,760
people the authors go on to say that

2336
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,679
they often hear their own guidance that

2337
01:28:57,679 --> 01:28:58,800
they write they wrote

2338
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,920
cited as a reason to say no to things um

2339
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:03,280
the other thing we often see in this

2340
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,120
space is not just saying no to things

2341
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:07,280
but a process which makes everything

2342
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,440
more difficult in the name of security

2343
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,040
and the authors note that in the report

2344
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:13,440
too they talk of users seeing computers

2345
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,120
that take an age to boot up due to

2346
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,280
multiple security applications

2347
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,120
internet access that blocks vast numbers

2348
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:20,960
of sites restricted lockdowns and

2349
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,719
smartphones that sometimes make more

2350
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:26,639
like bricks than a productive device

2351
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:28,719
and all of this in the name of security

2352
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:30,080
i actually experienced something like

2353
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:32,400
this in a project a long time ago

2354
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,120
when we were supporting the nhs where

2355
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,040
the smart cards that they'd introduced

2356
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,400
for staff to use

2357
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,719
uh to try and protect long long systems

2358
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:42,800
and access to privileged data

2359
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,600
was so clunky to use and just took so so

2360
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,280
much time for people to use and for the

2361
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,480
system to boot up

2362
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:49,920
that they ended up just using one

2363
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,159
person's card that was logged into the

2364
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:53,360
system all day

2365
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:54,639
because it was the only way they could

2366
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,480
access the health information they

2367
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,320
needed in the timely manner they needed

2368
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,239
to access it

2369
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:02,719
so a default no or difficult processes

2370
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:04,719
don't necessarily equal good security at

2371
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:07,440
the end of the day

2372
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,040
getting back to my teenager versus

2373
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,040
toddler example um like any good

2374
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,960
helicopter parents security teams can be

2375
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,880
so caught up in protecting their assets

2376
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,480
that they forget that the primary reason

2377
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,840
for the team to exist

2378
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,679
is actually to enable and support the

2379
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:21,520
organization to do things and not to

2380
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,040
bring it to a stop

2381
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,360
many good intention policies processes

2382
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:27,520
laws regulations create exactly this

2383
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,760
kind of environment an example i always

2384
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,719
give is my favorite topic gdpr

2385
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,880
one of the very first lines of gdpr

2386
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:35,760
states that it

2387
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:37,600
seeks to harmonize the protection of

2388
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,679
fundamental rights and freedoms of

2389
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:41,760
natural persons in respect to processing

2390
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,840
activities and here's the whammy

2391
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,080
and to ensure the free flow of personal

2392
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,159
data between member states

2393
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:50,320
and that's article 3 of gdpr if anyone's

2394
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,080
interested in geeking out

2395
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:54,159
um i think in reality we all know that

2396
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:55,920
the implementation of gdpr has done a

2397
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,760
lot more to break the free flow than to

2398
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:59,600
enable and to ensure it

2399
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,920
particularly within europe and even

2400
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,840
globally

2401
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,920
it doesn't mean that we're suggesting

2402
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:07,600
letting anyone do whatever they want of

2403
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:08,639
course it's all about

2404
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:10,880
balance we'd suggest starting off a

2405
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:11,679
project

2406
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:13,600
or a reaction to a request by thinking

2407
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,600
about how we can say yes to this

2408
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,920
and meet our requirements for security

2409
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,040
and integrity

2410
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,960
and if you start with that yes rather

2411
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,880
than no approach it can start a better

2412
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,400
conversation than looking for ways to

2413
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,280
say no

2414
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,520
even if it's not possible to facilitate

2415
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:31,120
everything at the end of the day

2416
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:34,000
yeah so the next um the next example is

2417
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
also related to a difficult conversation

2418
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,440
that needs to keep happening

2419
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,120
over and over again and i'm sure that

2420
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:40,719
when we started this presentation many

2421
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:42,000
of you thought that this is just going

2422
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,239
to be one of those

2423
01:31:44,239 --> 01:31:46,080
women ranting about lack of diversity

2424
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:47,520
and lack of women in the security

2425
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:48,719
community but

2426
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:50,880
we are still a minority and we all sat

2427
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,719
in those meetings and conference room

2428
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:55,840
full of uh white men uh on laptops and

2429
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:56,239
um

2430
01:31:56,239 --> 01:31:58,320
you know the dave rule which started as

2431
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:00,719
an insider joke in silicon valley

2432
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:03,760
is now um a kind of a running joke in

2433
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:05,280
other communities as well and if you

2434
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:06,400
haven't heard it

2435
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:09,440
um then the the rule is that

2436
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:11,280
once your work team includes as many

2437
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,360
women as does people named dave then you

2438
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:14,320
have achieved

2439
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,639
acceptable gender balance but we're not

2440
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:17,760
there yet

2441
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,120
i don't know how many percentages of

2442
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:20,320
dave's there are in the security

2443
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,880
community but there are currently around

2444
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,960
one quarter around one quarter of

2445
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,080
overall cyber security

2446
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:29,840
workforce female and um the situation is

2447
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,000
getting better so in 2017

2448
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,960
only 11 of study respondents were women

2449
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,400
so we can say that more of them are

2450
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,120
joining

2451
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,880
but the problem is that now we need them

2452
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,639
to stay so it's not enough to attract

2453
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:41,440
more diverse

2454
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:43,679
um it could be women could be other

2455
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:45,280
minorities it's not enough to attract

2456
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:46,880
them into the community or into the

2457
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,120
these organizations but also we need

2458
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,239
them to stay

2459
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:53,920
because here um lack of diversity is um

2460
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:55,520
both a cause of toxic

2461
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:58,880
toxic toxicity but also an outcome so

2462
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,760
um a lot of people from the minorities

2463
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,000
female and other minorities noted that

2464
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,600
they feel like they're unable or they

2465
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:06,960
just don't want to stay in a team

2466
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,320
anymore because of these

2467
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:11,440
toxic behaviors and toxic cultures so

2468
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:13,520
what we can do is of course create

2469
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:14,480
policies

2470
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:16,639
we can create engagement and career

2471
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:18,639
development plans for everyone that you

2472
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:21,120
know that everyone can benefit from

2473
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:24,080
and we can try to make um workers feel

2474
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,520
more welcome that way

2475
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:29,120
but really the key to in making everyone

2476
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:31,199
feel included and safe is just changing

2477
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:32,239
the culture the

2478
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:33,760
organizational culture needs to be a

2479
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,520
priority and

2480
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,520
the professionalism and empathy must be

2481
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,040
expected and modeled

2482
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:42,320
from from the highest management um

2483
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:45,679
down well thanks for that sakita

2484
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:47,120
and obviously at the moment it's pride

2485
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,679
month and if you look on twitter at the

2486
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:50,159
women

2487
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:53,280
in identity group they have also tweeted

2488
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,960
out some really amazing stats this

2489
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:55,840
morning

2490
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:59,520
um on representation of lgbtq

2491
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,280
groups within the workforce as well and

2492
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:02,880
that's really important that we look at

2493
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:05,040
as well

2494
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:08,719
moving on to another area um

2495
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:11,360
that's closely related though is um

2496
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:13,840
issues around ableist design

2497
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,520
and the quote that's up on the screen is

2498
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:17,440
about capture i don't think it's going

2499
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:20,000
to amaze anyone to think that capture is

2500
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,760
not perhaps the best thing to use when

2501
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,600
considering people with disabilities of

2502
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,840
any type

2503
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,520
but when researching potential issues

2504
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:29,280
that security processes can create to

2505
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:31,120
people with disabilities

2506
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,840
this particular w3c working group that

2507
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,360
we're looking at the inaccess

2508
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:37,199
in excess ability of capture and

2509
01:34:37,199 --> 01:34:39,440
alternatives to visual turing tests on

2510
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,920
the web which is a very catchy title

2511
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:45,520
um their findings really hit home i

2512
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:46,080
think

2513
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:48,880
um essentially at the end of the day our

2514
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,320
efforts to identify the difference

2515
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,719
between a computer and a human

2516
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:55,280
um basically excluded people with

2517
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:56,880
disabilities from that definition of

2518
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:57,760
human

2519
01:34:57,760 --> 01:34:59,199
and that really struck home and that

2520
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:01,119
really sucks and we have to stop things

2521
01:35:01,119 --> 01:35:02,080
like this

2522
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:04,000
um the problems we capture are well

2523
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,840
documented and well talked about

2524
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,119
but there are many many different

2525
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:09,440
approaches we use to authenticate users

2526
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,840
that can automatically exclude certain

2527
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,520
groups of users

2528
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,760
some examples of that might be the

2529
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:17,440
requirement for a highly complex

2530
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,600
password string without providing

2531
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,280
a password manager that can work

2532
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,960
effectively with a screen reader

2533
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:25,440
assistive app or voice input software

2534
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,280
and that can immediately lock out users

2535
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:28,960
with vision impairments or users with

2536
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:31,280
learning disabilities

2537
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:33,040
um there was again i obviously spent

2538
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:34,880
some time on twitter this morning um a

2539
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,719
really good string

2540
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:39,440
where one guy was really defending his

2541
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:40,560
position

2542
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,639
that all password managers were bad and

2543
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:44,000
evil and insecure

2544
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,760
um and he was looking at the attack

2545
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,760
surface of them and from a technical

2546
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:49,760
standpoint he may have been 100

2547
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,760
accurate um but he simply wasn't looking

2548
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:52,880
at the bigger picture

2549
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:55,040
in terms of usability and particularly

2550
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,000
around disability

2551
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,480
guidelines um other issues that have

2552
01:35:58,480 --> 01:35:59,920
come up repeatedly

2553
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,679
are issues with bias and facial

2554
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:02,960
recognition systems

2555
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,119
that's achieved national news coverage

2556
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:06,480
um it's been the

2557
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,320
subject of extensive research by the

2558
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,000
turing institute

2559
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,239
and when i was reading uh one of their

2560
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:13,199
reports

2561
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:16,239
um they actually noted that um this kind

2562
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:18,080
of facial bias began all the way back in

2563
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:19,760
the 19th century with the development of

2564
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,360
photography

2565
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,440
for generations the chemical makeup of

2566
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:25,520
film was designed to be best

2567
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:27,679
at capturing light skin surprise

2568
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:28,639
surprise

2569
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:30,320
and color film was insensitive to the

2570
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,639
wide range of non-white skin types

2571
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:34,400
and often failed to show the details of

2572
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:36,719
darker skinned faces

2573
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:38,159
i think we have to accept then that

2574
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:40,000
biometrics do not always offer the

2575
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,080
golden solution to flawed authentication

2576
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:44,400
processes

2577
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:46,560
again we're recommending a really simple

2578
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:47,520
check here

2579
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:49,520
um when a new process policy or

2580
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:50,880
procedure is put in place

2581
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:53,040
every project should ask itself who

2582
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,440
might be disenfranchising with this work

2583
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:56,880
what are the risks of vulnerable

2584
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,719
disabled or underrepresented groups

2585
01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:00,320
being accidentally locked out by these

2586
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:01,360
decisions

2587
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,040
and what we're doing with this is taking

2588
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,040
the you know rather basic touring test

2589
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:05,360
of

2590
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:08,000
human versus computer and really

2591
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,520
embracing a test that looks at all

2592
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:12,639
aspects of humanity

2593
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,840
the next behavior that we wanted to

2594
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:17,199
point out as toxic

2595
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:20,320
is the blame game or finger pointing

2596
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:22,000
so when a significant big incident

2597
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
happens in an organization the focus

2598
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
in a toxic environment immediately would

2599
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,400
go to who who's the one to blame

2600
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:31,199
and this type of organization looks for

2601
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:32,080
a scapegoat

2602
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,239
and eventually um more often than not

2603
01:37:34,239 --> 01:37:35,679
someone gets fired

2604
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:37,600
so this is even more prevalent now than

2605
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,600
uh many of those security cases

2606
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,199
are becoming more public due to the

2607
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:43,360
overall increase in legal action

2608
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:45,920
and as a result many more csos or

2609
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:49,040
similar type of um

2610
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:52,159
position positions in organizations they

2611
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:53,040
get their

2612
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,840
their contracts terminated as a result

2613
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:56,880
so nominee

2614
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:59,840
study has found out that an average

2615
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:00,560
tenure of

2616
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:04,000
seesaw is less than three years and uh

2617
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,239
even more uh nearly a third of the

2618
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:08,159
respondents say that it's less than two

2619
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:08,800
years

2620
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,199
so one of the things that you can do is

2621
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:12,960
to analyze the average tenure of your

2622
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,880
security leadership and if it turns out

2623
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,080
to be less than three years

2624
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:18,560
or even worse less than two years this

2625
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,400
could be a warning sign that maybe you

2626
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,800
your culture needs to change um but

2627
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,320
nominee also did a

2628
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:27,280
cso stress report um last year in 2019

2629
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:30,239
and the vast majority of csos 88

2630
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:32,159
um claim that they are moderately or

2631
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:34,239
tremendously stressed at work

2632
01:38:34,239 --> 01:38:36,320
and one-third of them um said that

2633
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,000
stress affected their ability to do

2634
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:38,800
their job

2635
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:43,360
so what happens here is their stress

2636
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:45,040
they're stressed because you know their

2637
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:46,639
job and then they're more likely to make

2638
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:48,400
a mistake and because they make mistakes

2639
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,320
they get fired and then it's like an

2640
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:53,760
endless circle um so another

2641
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:56,159
um thing that is really worrying is that

2642
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:57,440
95

2643
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:00,000
almost all of the interviewed cso said

2644
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:00,639
that

2645
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:02,880
um they worked more than contract their

2646
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,600
contracted hours and 87 percent of them

2647
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,239
said that

2648
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:08,239
working additional hours was expected by

2649
01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:10,159
their organization so that obviously can

2650
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:12,159
lead to higher rates of burnout

2651
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:14,960
and um it's it just signifies a failure

2652
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:15,679
in overall

2653
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:19,920
organization leadership um so

2654
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:23,119
which shows that you know changing this

2655
01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:23,920
and making

2656
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:26,320
it a more positive culture it becomes

2657
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:27,520
more crucial than ever

2658
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:28,960
because all of these csos are just going

2659
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:31,199
to burn out one day and who's going to

2660
01:39:31,199 --> 01:39:33,440
who's going to take responsibility so

2661
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:34,560
what we advise

2662
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:37,520
to do is monitor employees mental health

2663
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:38,239
promote

2664
01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:41,040
work-life balance and then things go

2665
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:42,719
wrong and things will go wrong because

2666
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:44,560
it doesn't matter you know how

2667
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:47,840
hard you work incidents happen

2668
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,560
we suggest to use blame-free tools such

2669
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:51,119
as

2670
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:54,000
hot wash sessions where you just discuss

2671
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:54,960
what went well what

2672
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:58,080
what you could improve and um definitely

2673
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,760
avoid pointing fingers like this guy in

2674
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:00,400
the slide

2675
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,638
does

2676
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:06,960
so moving on from your employees to how

2677
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:08,960
you might entreat um other users within

2678
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:10,080
your organization

2679
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,239
and maybe externally uh is loser

2680
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:14,719
attitude um and this is the definition

2681
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:16,320
of people talking about a painfully

2682
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:18,480
annoying stupid or irritating computer

2683
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,119
user

2684
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:20,880
and yeah we all know them we all

2685
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:22,239
experience them every day

2686
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:24,960
users can be a complete pain to work

2687
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,000
with

2688
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,320
they can be very very frustrating

2689
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:29,520
getting users to understand that

2690
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:31,199
security measures you want to put in

2691
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:31,679
place

2692
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:34,000
and why they're necessary can be really

2693
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,199
problematic

2694
01:40:35,199 --> 01:40:36,960
there's the old adage of the problem

2695
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:38,400
exists between the keyboard and the

2696
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:38,800
chair

2697
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:42,080
and we get it however if you immediately

2698
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:43,119
go into every act

2699
01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:44,639
interaction with your users with this

2700
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:46,159
attitude the conversation immediately

2701
01:40:46,159 --> 01:40:48,080
starts off on their own foot

2702
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:50,000
um if we combine this with some of the

2703
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,760
other attitude challenges we've talked

2704
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,360
about here in this presentation

2705
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:55,760
hero culture culture of no blame game

2706
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:57,600
the interactions between security staff

2707
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,840
and users can quickly become fraught

2708
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,520
and lead to some very very common

2709
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:04,239
problems uh if you assume that all users

2710
01:41:04,239 --> 01:41:05,040
are stupid

2711
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,719
you assume you don't need to explain

2712
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:08,000
anything to them because they're too

2713
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,840
stupid to understand the directions

2714
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:10,960
right

2715
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:12,639
security patches processes and

2716
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:14,560
requirements can often be barked out as

2717
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:16,080
orders with the assumption that the user

2718
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:17,920
should follow the commands blindly

2719
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:19,280
because security

2720
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:21,040
um busy users may simply ignore

2721
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:22,560
instructions as they don't feel they

2722
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,080
have the information to process

2723
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:26,400
or can even feel insulted by the lack of

2724
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,000
information shared because you know they

2725
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,520
perhaps don't think they're as stupid as

2726
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:30,719
you do

2727
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:32,560
taking the time to give users a really

2728
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:34,239
brief overview of why a measure has been

2729
01:41:34,239 --> 01:41:34,800
brought in

2730
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:37,040
what the impact is how it can help them

2731
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,960
this can quickly avoid resentment

2732
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:40,719
and can quickly avoid a breakdown in

2733
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:42,560
communication and interaction between

2734
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:46,000
teams loser attitude and snapchat

2735
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,840
judgments of user abilities can also

2736
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,679
lead to other toxic behaviors

2737
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:51,280
especially if left to an individual

2738
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:53,920
staff in one of my early job roles our

2739
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:55,760
team was somewhat of a satellite team

2740
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:57,920
supported by one guy from the university

2741
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,600
iit department

2742
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,119
we were not allowed admin rights on our

2743
01:42:01,119 --> 01:42:03,920
laptops fairly common at the time

2744
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:05,840
but some discretion was given as the job

2745
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:07,840
roles performed by my team weren't

2746
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:11,280
typical user profiles the way this it

2747
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:12,800
guy decided to

2748
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:15,360
apply that discretion was to allow admin

2749
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,360
rights to all the men within the team

2750
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:20,639
but not to any of the women

2751
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:24,080
that was a long time ago right

2752
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,639
now hopefully that changed but that's

2753
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:28,000
still a very good illustration

2754
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,960
of how that can go wrong um so the last

2755
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,159
uh the last

2756
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:34,880
example that we chose of toxic toxic

2757
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:35,679
behaviors or

2758
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:37,840
um in this in this scenario perhaps a

2759
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:40,400
toxic security personality type is then

2760
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:43,760
security uh manager is um isolated

2761
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:46,320
and um he doesn't like to he or she

2762
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:47,920
sorry doesn't like to listen to the

2763
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:50,000
actual business side of the discussions

2764
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
um they don't try to learn the unique

2765
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,400
challenges of operations teams and

2766
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:56,239
business managers

2767
01:42:56,239 --> 01:42:58,800
for them secure is secure period and the

2768
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,480
context doesn't matter

2769
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:03,199
um the risks don't matter and you know

2770
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:03,920
the the

2771
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:06,480
attitude this attitude just leads um

2772
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:07,840
leaves them to becoming

2773
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:10,880
irrelevant or at least isolated

2774
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:14,080
so security managers or or

2775
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:16,480
security teams could be an entire team

2776
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,119
who behave

2777
01:43:17,119 --> 01:43:19,440
in this way or who who has this attitude

2778
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,119
they just make enemies of themselves an

2779
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:22,719
organization

2780
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:24,880
and create boundaries between security

2781
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,719
and the rest of organization

2782
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:28,320
and what needs to happen if we really

2783
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:29,840
want to achieve our goals is the

2784
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:30,800
opposite

2785
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,719
you know security team and security

2786
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:34,400
people need to become integral part of

2787
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,760
your organization

2788
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:38,880
and um help people do their jobs

2789
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,440
in a secure manner but rather than

2790
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:43,040
preventing them from completing some

2791
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:44,320
tasks

2792
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:46,239
and make by making things more secure

2793
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:47,600
think about how

2794
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,280
to make the colleagues lives easier and

2795
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:51,360
rather rather than more difficult

2796
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:53,199
but all of that requires understanding

2797
01:43:53,199 --> 01:43:55,440
of the organization of the industry of

2798
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:56,480
the context

2799
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:58,480
and for that security leaders the

2800
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:00,639
security people need to be more open

2801
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:02,320
they need to be more networked in the

2802
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:03,920
organization and

2803
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:05,360
more transparent with the rest of the

2804
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:07,119
organization and in that way we can

2805
01:44:07,119 --> 01:44:07,920
create a

2806
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:10,560
proactive rather than reactive security

2807
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:12,560
culture

2808
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:15,600
so those are the 10 10

2809
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:17,600
problems that we identified but we don't

2810
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:19,040
want to just talk about problems as i

2811
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:20,880
said at the beginning we would like you

2812
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:24,159
each one of you to take at least one one

2813
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:26,320
piece of homework home and uh and try to

2814
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:27,760
change something so we

2815
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:30,480
prepared the quick solution slide um for

2816
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:31,520
you as well

2817
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:34,960
and um the first one um is diversity we

2818
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:36,480
mentioned it many times this was

2819
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:37,760
it was mentioned many times in our

2820
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,679
presentation and it's not something that

2821
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:41,199
is just going to happen if we sit here

2822
01:44:41,199 --> 01:44:42,719
and wait for more different people to

2823
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:43,199
join

2824
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:46,000
cyber security we really need to have a

2825
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:46,719
deliberate

2826
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:48,239
and well-thought-out diversity and

2827
01:44:48,239 --> 01:44:49,760
communication plan

2828
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,920
and some organizations have already done

2829
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:53,679
that so we can consult the community on

2830
01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:54,320
that and

2831
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:58,400
and diversify our teams in that way

2832
01:44:58,400 --> 01:44:59,920
so the second point is to support and

2833
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:01,840
manage positive team culture and it's

2834
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:03,440
not just enough to allow the team

2835
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:04,239
culture to grow

2836
01:45:04,239 --> 01:45:06,400
organically you need to really put some

2837
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,159
thought and effort into planning

2838
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:10,080
to making a team culture that's positive

2839
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:11,679
both within the team itself

2840
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:13,679
and in its interactions with other teams

2841
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:16,880
within the organization

2842
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:19,199
um we suggest that you empower rather

2843
01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:21,360
than belittler users so ideally we

2844
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:23,520
all want everyone in our organization

2845
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,119
and our communities to be security

2846
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:26,239
conscious

2847
01:45:26,239 --> 01:45:27,920
but for that to happen we need to stop

2848
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:29,360
thinking and making them

2849
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:30,960
the users feel like they're the weakest

2850
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:32,960
link and include them in all things

2851
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:35,199
security instead

2852
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:37,040
and to go alongside that you really need

2853
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:38,800
to have a meaningful training program

2854
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,639
tailored not only to your organization

2855
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:42,560
but tailored to your users and one that

2856
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:46,000
the users can enjoy participating in

2857
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,239
and the last advice is work on how to

2858
01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:50,159
say yes and and i like this one because

2859
01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:51,040
it comes from

2860
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:52,960
improv theater where um you're you

2861
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:54,480
always say yes and so

2862
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:55,920
we're not saying that you always need to

2863
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:57,920
say yes immediately but before you say

2864
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:58,400
no

2865
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:00,560
make sure that it's definitely a no and

2866
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:02,080
at least genuinely try to find a

2867
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:03,760
solution to their problem before denying

2868
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:04,320
them

2869
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:07,199
whatever request that was that was sent

2870
01:46:07,199 --> 01:46:09,119
to you

2871
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:11,280
and that's it that's the end of our

2872
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:12,800
presentation um and i think we're

2873
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:13,840
slightly over time

2874
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:17,119
um and i believe we go to uh

2875
01:46:17,119 --> 01:46:21,119

2876
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:25,520
