1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,970
okay I know you've come to hear our

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,200
speaker not me

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,290
so I'll be very brief when I was

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,080
training seasick people a few years ago

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,929
I used to say that our job was to

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,320
corrupt innocent sis admins and network

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,600
admins to make them think in different

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,520
ways and do things that they never

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,529
thought possible

10
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:25,199
first time I saw our keynote speaker he

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,060
was doing pretty much that too a Barbie

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,570
doll so I'm really looking forward to

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,809
hearing what Ken Monroe from Pentos

14
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,170
partners has been up to in what I think

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,200
of as the Internet of Things that should

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:54,239
not be on the Internet bear with me a

17
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,719
moment why plug some things in this

18
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,770
could take a moment or two

19
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:27,040
great

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,210
it looks like you're working crikey good

21
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,680
morning my name is Ken Ken Monroe and my

22
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,540
job I'm a security researcher I spent a

23
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,520
lot of time working with a team of pen

24
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,430
testers there's a lot of us there but

25
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,110
what we're really into is kind of going

26
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,240
a bit further than many would and doing

27
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,670
some really and what often we come

28
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,080
across is quite wasteful things so we

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,970
spent 5,000 pounds on a smart fridge

30
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,730
destroyed it just so we could extract

31
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,399
the CPU and in there we managed to find

32
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:12,130
a bunch of via mappings which meant we

33
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,480
could didn't you rate the JTAG and we

34
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,490
found our way to root on a Samson smart

35
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,220
fridge that allowed us to extract the

36
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,810
email credentials of the user who is

37
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,910
using it by driving past it but do lots

38
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,890
of weird things we spent a lot of time

39
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,980
looking at smart devices a lot of time

40
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,600
reporting security vulnerabilities to

41
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,820
smart device vendors and I think what

42
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,010
sets them apart is actually how they

43
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,460
respond to responsible disclosure so

44
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,980
we've had everything from the most

45
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,530
simple seamless response thanks guys

46
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,000
that's great we'll get that fixed it'll

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,630
be done in 30 days cool through to legal

48
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,550
threats and cease and desists which

49
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,580
never ends well I assure you because I

50
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,540
don't know if any of you have come

51
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,940
across this dry sound effect it's

52
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,560
amazing how the media take an interest

53
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,180
when security researchers get some

54
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,270
threatened so you probably saw the title

55
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:05,440
of my talk talking about backdoors in

56
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,910
backdoors and I'm sure some of you are

57
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,620
expecting me to talk about an amazing

58
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,760
backdoor in meterpreter or some of you

59
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,550
might have seen my earlier work in Apple

60
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,739
toys maybe I don't know we won't tell

61
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,970
whether I'm gonna be talking quite

62
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,290
literally about vulnerabilities in

63
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,810
backdoors this is very much a literal

64
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,850
discussion and I'd like to bring along a

65
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,780
product we've been looking at recently

66
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,790
this is undisclosed research we've been

67
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,750
looking at a rather fun fingerprint door

68
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,489
lock this is it and it makes a heck of a

69
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:34,060
racket

70
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,620
the on idea being is you put your finger

71
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,239
on there and you can get in fantastic

72
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:39,310
it's got a pin as well it pads the pins

73
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,959
thought this is going to be a really

74
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,970
good interesting secure door lock to

75
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,430
play with it's called the ultra lock so

76
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,290
we started having a play with it looking

77
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,960
at how the technology worked and

78
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,280
realized the most ludicrous of

79
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,470
vulnerabilities is it

80
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,510
neck's also you can unlock it using a

81
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,340
phone you can tap your phone it uses

82
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,690
Bluetooth low-energy Blee and it uses a

83
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,460
static salt which you can reverse you

84
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,870
need to know two things needs know the

85
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,220
Bluetooth characteristic which it

86
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,290
broadcasts whenever you talk to it the

87
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,850
last thing you need to crack is a six

88
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,820
digit PIN so it brings the realm of the

89
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,290
crack into the matter of a few minutes

90
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,810
just by walking up to a door you've

91
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,519
unlocked it this is crazy and they'll be

92
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,170
here these smart door locks in this talk

93
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,900
but that's when things got just a little

94
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,880
bit silly because at the bottom of it

95
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,470
you're really gonna struggle to see

96
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,240
there is a small hole with a key but

97
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,310
there's a bit of space around the lock

98
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,850
and we gobsmack memorize we could get in

99
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,550
a small shim from the underside of the

100
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,550
lock and trigger the spring this is a

101
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:46,630
really really smart lock not a good

102
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,460
start right I know sometimes you find

103
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,770
the most simple tricks work you don't

104
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,540
even need to use your lock picks in the

105
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,669
way they are intended so let's go back a

106
00:04:57,669 --> 00:04:59,410
little bit now I'm sure some of you will

107
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,530
see now early work in fun things you

108
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,169
might remember my Wi-Fi kettle from back

109
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:06,490
in the day I'd like a show of hands who

110
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,919
remembers the Wi-Fi kettle Wow only a

111
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,200
few of you crikey will do this in detail

112
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,380
then excellent most of you are now going

113
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,510
why the heck have you got a Wi-Fi kettle

114
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,150
cab well the idea being is you place

115
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,550
this in your kitchen as a smart base and

116
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,890
it means when you wake up in the morning

117
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,270
you roll over out of bed you press a

118
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,190
button on the smart phone app and by the

119
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,290
time you get to kitchen you've got a

120
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,450
kettle full of boiling water saving you

121
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,120
maybe thirty seconds of your day wow

122
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,240
this is cool now I saw this age is

123
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,320
nasally I think this is four and a half

124
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,500
years I first found the Wi-Fi kettle and

125
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,620
I thought surely no they've got the

126
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,940
security of this right well so I started

127
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,410
reverse engineering it which usually

128
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,510
means getting a screwdriver out because

129
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,640
I want to look at the hardware I got the

130
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,590
base in pieces I found the chipset

131
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,320
I found the manual for the chipset on

132
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,680
the public Internet because you do I

133
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,820
then reverse engineered the mobile

134
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,800
application Android it's easy it's just

135
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,270
a Java resource

136
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,100
readable I started looking at how it

137
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:15,070
connects so okay port 23 telnet it's not

138
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,900
a good start but hey you know I've got

139
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,610
to be on the on the the right network to

140
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,750
start where they've got to compromise to

141
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,030
hope it's our on put telnet so I tell

142
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,070
knitted to my kettle and it came up with

143
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,470
a terminal and it required a pin and I'm

144
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,930
thinking what am I gonna do brute force

145
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,090
gonna take a while so I started looking

146
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,340
through the manual I looked for the just

147
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,970
search the manual for the word pin and

148
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,220
the pin was six zeros and it was static

149
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,480
and it couldn't be changed one two three

150
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,460
four five six brilliant I then looked

151
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,840
through the mobile application and look

152
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,690
to see how it configured itself as a

153
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,160
wireless client on your network because

154
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,600
not to do that it's gonna need your pre

155
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,380
share key right your wireless passcode I

156
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,640
then tried the same commands you used to

157
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,260
set it up eighty plus key and I could

158
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,560
recover your Wi-Fi network key in plain

159
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,440
text by connecting to your kettle even

160
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,480
better it responded well that the

161
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,070
authentication so I could drive past

162
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,930
your house deal with your kettle set up

163
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,600
an evil twin and recover your wireless

164
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,790
network key all because you wanted to

165
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,540
boil hot water from your bedroom why is

166
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,910
hey but did that really matter so much

167
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,800
because you could only boil on your

168
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,960
local network you could only command the

169
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,970
kettle on your same Wi-Fi hotspot

170
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,560
there was no API so it didn't really

171
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,180
matter is one at a time I mean there

172
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,590
were some fun things you could do so you

173
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,540
could geolocate them so you could go out

174
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,890
and find all the kettles in the west of

175
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,510
London that was quite cool so if you

176
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,150
want to just search wiggle the SSID

177
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,650
you're looking for is I cattle and you

178
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,880
can go find all the kettles in the world

179
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,810
loads of them so you know where people's

180
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,240
P SKS can be stolen from great and you

181
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,810
probably also remember my swearing dog

182
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,190
another chef hand please who remembers

183
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,250
my friend Kayla to many of you I will do

184
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,360
her anyway come on

185
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,150
so this is my friend Kayla she's an

186
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,000
interactive talking kids doll brilliant

187
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,490
from the idea the child can talk to the

188
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,270
doll and the doll can decode the voice

189
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,550
to text and then have a number of

190
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,380
interactive responses with your child

191
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:19,450
now I saw her a few years ago on the

192
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,070
shelf in the toy store

193
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,950
she looks interesting said Charles Seife

194
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,920
on the box Internet friendly and it also

195
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,250
suggested she had some anti profanity

196
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,679
filters ah so if the child swore at the

197
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,840
dolly it would tell at them to go and

198
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,120
speak to their parents and the hacker in

199
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,400
me is going can I make this doll swear

200
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,470
she's too innocent isn't she but before

201
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,910
we go there I started looking at how she

202
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,670
operated so she connects to a smart

203
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,260
phone and the phone does all the heavy

204
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,490
lifting it does the voice to text

205
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,850
conversion and contains all the data the

206
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,820
doll has a speaker a microphone and a

207
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,820
Bluetooth connection to the phone and I

208
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,480
kid you not

209
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,100
she's effectively a Bluetooth headset

210
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,080
you can connect it to your cell phone

211
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,150
and make telephone calls on the doll if

212
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:15,610
you wish as you probably know in the UK

213
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,020
it's illegal to drive with your cell

214
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,990
phone to your ear but

215
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,050
I did genuinely check with the police

216
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,890
officer and he decided that as it was a

217
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,990
Bluetooth headset in theory it was legal

218
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,020
to drive with adulterate it's very

219
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,610
bizarre looks anyway back to the

220
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,770
technology how did we figure out how to

221
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,320
make her do stuff so we reverse

222
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,750
engineered the mobile app and I'm

223
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,180
thinking how does she know how what a

224
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,399
swear word is in order to understand

225
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,230
what the child says she must have a

226
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,720
database of swearing content so we

227
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,100
reverse engineer the app and inside

228
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,190
found a sequel like database full of

229
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,520
1536 really good swear words so he

230
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,260
deleted it and now she swears like a

231
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,399
docker and I thought I would record it

232
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,510
for you now hopefully this will work

233
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,339
let's give a little go on the audio

234
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:22,730
there she's so rude what are we gonna do

235
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,860
now that was the fun bit I was I was

236
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,149
just doing that my entertainment with

237
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:28,370
some of my colleagues but there is a

238
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,020
serious sight of this as well

239
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,839
when she connects to your phone over

240
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:35,230
Bluetooth which uses Bluetooth classic

241
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,490
and unlike your hands-free car

242
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,459
connection there is no pin you don't

243
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:42,500
have to submit a pin to connect to the

244
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,029
doll which means that anyone in

245
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:45,529
Bluetooth audio range can connect the

246
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:46,940
speaker in the microphone of this dolly

247
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,920
which means someone across the street

248
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,230
the next house can speak to your child

249
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,230
through the doll and can listen to you

250
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,579
through the doll

251
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:58,220
and I find that really very creepy

252
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,010
indeed now we put the doll to bed a few

253
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,959
years ago I've got bored affair but then

254
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,300
a consumer protection organization in

255
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,130
Norway picked up on some of the work

256
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,899
we've done and realized actually there

257
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:11,149
are huge privacy problems and I'm going

258
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:13,399
to leave Kayla for a bit we'll come back

259
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,380
to her a little bit later because there

260
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,940
has been some good news and some

261
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,589
progress which is great other crazy

262
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:26,050
things we've been looking at I thought

263
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,370
four years ago five years ago when I

264
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,480
first got into Internet of Things

265
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,760
security I thought that market forces

266
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,260
and pressure from the Sumer

267
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,910
organizations and governments would

268
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,670
improve matters I thought that

269
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,399
demand forces concerns about privacy

270
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,839
would actually drive manufacturers to

271
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,649
make things better and unfortunately

272
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:46,519
over the last couple of years I think

273
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:51,050
seeing things start to get worse I've

274
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,930
seen security flaws that affected point

275
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,089
products like my doll and my kettle now

276
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:58,880
start to become systemic and it's no

277
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,430
longer a tack of one thing in one house

278
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,510
at a time

279
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,700
it's now hack of all the things

280
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,010
concurrently and that's what we I'm

281
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,360
going to dwell on him most of my talk

282
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,649
today the kettle as was is now much more

283
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,839
secure the 3.0 version of the eye kettle

284
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:16,370
is actually really good really well

285
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,019
locked down and the reason they did that

286
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:19,579
is they brought in some expertise

287
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:21,079
in-house I know the guy in house there

288
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:22,490
he's a really cool guy and they also

289
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,140
outsource their back-end platform

290
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,760
provision to a third party who actually

291
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,950
really knows their stuff however we've

292
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,529
been looking at lots of different

293
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:31,910
outsource deities platforms and found a

294
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,279
whole trainwreck of vulnerabilities and

295
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,959
I'm going to start with one and this is

296
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:39,680
something that really bothers me

297
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,029
actually this is a GPS tracking watch

298
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:47,269
for kids now for those parents if you're

299
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:48,529
out there like me have you ever had that

300
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:50,269
thing when you go to the play park or

301
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,370
somewhere and you turn your back for a

302
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,540
moment and your child walks off and

303
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,279
there's a huge panic right well it

304
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,690
happens to me I'm clearly a bad parent

305
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,300
right but that moment of panic when my

306
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,000
children have walked off I'm now running

307
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,250
around and I've had I've lost I've

308
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,230
sweated loads of five or ten minutes

309
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,640
wondering where I am one of my kids has

310
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,680
gone and the idea of these GPS tracking

311
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,470
watches is that you can connect to the

312
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,140
watch from a smartphone app and see

313
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,910
where your child is what a brilliant

314
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,699
idea or for elderly of honorable

315
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,920
relatives you can also track them so if

316
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,899
people with maybe cognitive issues or

317
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:27,320
impairments walk off you can find them

318
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,810
again easily what a great idea so we

319
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,550
started looking at these and found some

320
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,890
really really worrying security concerns

321
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,019
there's a GPS tracking device in there

322
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:38,750
and also a sim the sim so you can do

323
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,579
data communications back to the mobile

324
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:43,850
app what we discovered was there a

325
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,320
series of insecure direct object

326
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,180
references within that which meant that

327
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,520
user a you could see the data fair user

328
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,430
be

329
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,960
which meant we could track something

330
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,280
like 20,000 children in real-time we

331
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,960
could also rewrite their positions using

332
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,450
API so we can make children uh neither

333
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,980
appear to be where they're supposed to

334
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,990
be when they've been abducted or make

335
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,310
them appear to have driven off down the

336
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:08,310
motorway pretty horrible right this is a

337
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,570
device that's supposed to make our

338
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,280
children safer and give our parents

339
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,080
confidence but actually it makes our

340
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,720
children more vulnerable and the really

341
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,110
creepy bit it has a mobile sim in so it

342
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,890
has GSM functionality the idea is if the

343
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,270
child presses an emergency button

344
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,920
it sets up a call to their parent and

345
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,900
only their parent we discovered flaws in

346
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,600
the API that allowed anyone to silently

347
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,170
call the watch and listen to the child

348
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,530
so your children could be snooped on we

349
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,480
thought this is bad that's not good

350
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,700
and we started digging deeper and deeper

351
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,280
into GPS trackers we found GPS trackers

352
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,660
on elderly tracking infirm

353
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,510
living alone we found trackers on cars

354
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,870
so far we've tracked nearly 32 million

355
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,750
different devices on over a thousand

356
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,330
different device types every one of

357
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,980
which could be connected to remotely and

358
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,980
listened to or the position rewritten

359
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,600
pretty horrible isn't it in this

360
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,510
particular case this was a campaign that

361
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,250
was taken up by the Icelandic Data

362
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,400
Protection regulator and they banned a

363
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,530
watch using a rather cool EU rap X alert

364
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,820
which I've never seen before which gets

365
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,260
a an instant alert across the whole of

366
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,530
Europe to all data protection agencies

367
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,790
we went a little bit deeper we realised

368
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,680
that actually the rapid alert that

369
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,020
affected one brand of watched actually

370
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,140
affected 367 different device types from

371
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,380
an OEM called think race these what I

372
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,410
mean by systemic security flaws doesn't

373
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,270
affect one thing it affects everything

374
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,610
and multiple brands and some of you

375
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,830
might have seen that I spoiled your

376
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,700
Christmas Eve

377
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,040
we did a piece of recording with the BBC

378
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,610
and we found a hot tub a smart hot tub

379
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,690
that you can control from your

380
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:55,520
smartphone remotely with no account

381
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,520
authorization at all all you needed was

382
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,680
the idea of the tub there was no user

383
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,140
accounts no authentication you just said

384
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,150
two requests with the tub ID which were

385
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,070
sequential so it didn't take very much

386
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,140
to do and you could compromise people's

387
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,720
hot tubs now this was silly the only

388
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,310
things you could do would turn it on and

389
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,800
off so you really wants to annoy people

390
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,750
you could freeze out their hot tub or

391
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,850
you could turn on the Jets which sprayed

392
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,790
you with water not so serious but it did

393
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,010
matter because in just the same way as

394
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,880
systemic flaws we saw earlier we found

395
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,670
lots and lots of other devices connected

396
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,540
to the same back-end platform with no

397
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,030
sufficient authentication or device

398
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,870
authorization and they included trucks

399
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,790
cars and we even found two different

400
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,500
types of smart medical devices connected

401
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,460
with the very same back-end so a hot tub

402
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:54,140
led us into a smart hot assist valve

403
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,130
getting creepier by the moment this

404
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:56,640
isn't it

405
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,300
not a good place to go I'm sure you've

406
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,380
all remember me right

407
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,619
do you remember October 2016 when I lost

408
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,270
Twitter for two hours I didn't know what

409
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:06,810
to do

410
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,720
Mirai you probably remember it as an IOT

411
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,089
botnet that's affected printers cameras

412
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:14,339
VoIP foams lots of things it took social

413
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:18,230
networks down by ddossing a DNS provider

414
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,740
it wasn't me right version 1 was not an

415
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,709
IT botnet it was something quite

416
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:27,869
interesting it was a digital video

417
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:31,230
recorder botnet not even CCTV so you use

418
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,270
a DVR to record the footage from your

419
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,580
CCTV cameras that was when we found

420
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,410
another vulnerability and what had gone

421
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,480
wrong is during the process of reverse

422
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,110
engineering the firmware the code of

423
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:46,500
Mirai is 63 sets that default

424
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,960
credentials are found and some really

425
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,340
cool people doing a lot of great work

426
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,060
try to match up those default credential

427
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,390
sets with known default creds and most

428
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,290
of them that got right but a number of

429
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,140
them went wrong and a few examples so

430
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,700
Zed LX x dot now I could find that one

431
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,620
turns out it was a cubist DVR we managed

432
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,840
to make that match you see there is a

433
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,000
printer and a VoIP phone so what had

434
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,050
gone wrong is people were trying to

435
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,500
match than to condense

436
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,570
with known default credentials instead

437
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,590
of going a little bit deeper going

438
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,240
actually there's something common to all

439
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,710
these so we bought 63 different digital

440
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,680
video recorders and successfully proved

441
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,320
that Mira version one was a DVR botnet

442
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,420
and nothing else that's not safe version

443
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,170
2 3 and onwards do attack other devices

444
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,480
but Mira version 1 was just about these

445
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,480
and what that research then uncovered

446
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,200
was that Mirai was a single point fail

447
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,930
and as a single fail in a vendor called

448
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,050
Zhang my this was work we did in 2016 it

449
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,360
all pointed back to one make back so

450
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,460
it's a bit like an SDK that allowed the

451
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,590
device manufacturers to customize the

452
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,720
branding of the DVR firmware so when you

453
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,310
look at it all the fur all the firmware

454
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,750
on you eyes look very similar they've

455
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,310
got different brands and it was this

456
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,200
make pack that allowed you to wreak

457
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,540
ustym eyes so that X Y Zed brand DVR

458
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,740
looked a little bit different for

459
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,110
another one and we also found a bunch of

460
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,210
other vulnerabilities several code

461
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,440
execution pools remote code execution

462
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,300
that were never used by mirror because

463
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,040
they hadn't been found and what I found

464
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,510
frustrating about Mirai

465
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,790
was because it was classified as an IOT

466
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,650
botnet we missed the opportunities to

467
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,630
see the systemic issue which was one

468
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:33,590
mistake by one vendor and I think was a

469
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,000
real missed opportunity

470
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,750
systemic vulnerabilities now I want to

471
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,270
have some fun another crazy systemic

472
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:45,560
vulnerability this is the tap lock lock

473
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,710
know what it is it's another fingerprint

474
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:51,380
padlock and I love fingerprint padlocks

475
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,150
because I'm hopeless with my keys I'm

476
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,620
forever putting my keys down and

477
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,330
forgetting them but I don't forget my

478
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,860
fingers very often which is a good place

479
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,260
to be so we started looking at the tap

480
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,190
lock as an interesting device it was

481
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,780
funded on Shark Tank so the equipment of

482
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,520
Dragon's Den in the USA and a youtuber

483
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,220
noticed that if he stuck a GoPro mounts

484
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,900
or a very sticky pad to the back of the

485
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,660
lock he could unscrew it and the load of

486
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,880
coverage about why people shouldn't buy

487
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,290
this this padlock so we thought

488
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,280
interesting let's see what else we can

489
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,070
find first of all we discovered that the

490
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,780
padlock he'd had was actually you had a

491
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,300
design flaw in the one he had and none

492
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,680
of the others for love the money

493
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,970
we get the backs off but we started

494
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,220
going further and we started looking at

495
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,850
the security of it really secure is got

496
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,470
128 bit encryption great used by the

497
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:45,290
military must be great right yeah let's

498
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,480
have a little look so we started taking

499
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,490
a part we started looking at how you

500
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,740
unlock it you have three options

501
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,110
fingerprint you can tap it or you can

502
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,970
also bizarrely send Morse code to it

503
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,710
when was the last time we saw Morse code

504
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,900
on anything but we wanted to look at the

505
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,120
Bluetooth connection so we started

506
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,740
connecting to it so these keys what are

507
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,450
those keys all about started going a

508
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,400
little bit further what's going on here

509
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,570
there's some interesting characteristics

510
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,330
going on what more do we need to do and

511
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,370
we started reverse engineering the

512
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,530
mobile app to see how these keys were

513
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,150
created that it unlocks over Bluetooth

514
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:21,970
and realized it was getting the seeds

515
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,910
from the MAC address the Bluetooth MAC

516
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,730
address the one characteristic it

517
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,800
brought to us publicly that anyone can

518
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,690
connect to what it turned out to be

519
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,250
doing was chopping the MAC address in

520
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,380
half upper casing one lower case than

521
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,360
the other and turning it into the key

522
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,970
which means that anyone could walk past

523
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,850
the padlock and unlock it for a left

524
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,790
here we go we managed to unlock it in

525
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,770
just under two seconds there it goes

526
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:52,880
it's popped and it's now out crazy we're

527
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,370
still thinking this as a point is you so

528
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,230
we disclose it to manufacture we told

529
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,400
them at this issue and they said yes all

530
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,030
right we know about that

531
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,140
well that's an unusual response to this

532
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:09,320
closure Wow okay so you know about this

533
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,790
and you're not doing anything okay fine

534
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,360
though then some weird stuff happened we

535
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,150
discovered that the API that the mobile

536
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,940
app connects to also leaks the GPS

537
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,480
position of all of the locks and you can

538
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,980
unlock the locks over the API could it

539
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,520
get any less secure I don't know so I

540
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,900
sent them an email me and just that's

541
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,580
the copy of the email I said I said guys

542
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,530
this is crazy this is a security product

543
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:40,490
and it's trivial to compromise and

544
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,990
you've acknowledged that you know it's

545
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:45,050
secure insecure sorry so you need to

546
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,370
take your API down because people can

547
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,900
still unlock it locally and safely using

548
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,270
the fingerprint mechanism but you can't

549
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,640
disclose people's GPS coordinates of

550
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,860
their houses of their accounts and you

551
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,280
know what they did so I think they

552
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,590
rescued victory from the jaws of defeat

553
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:03,410
there they took their API down which I

554
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,230
thought was really really responsible

555
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,320
and you can't buy them anymore they took

556
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,030
them off the internet this one I had to

557
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,670
import from Germany I think in the end

558
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:16,700
they've been taken off they're just

559
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,530
about to relaunch so I understand and

560
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,180
they were talking about maybe sending

561
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,440
one for us to have a little play with

562
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:27,380
more issues with systemic security flaws

563
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,380
some work we did a little while back

564
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,340
somewhere we had a lot of fun doing

565
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,850
we're starting to look at car alarms

566
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:39,290
security and starting to see how people

567
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,150
were addressing the problem with key

568
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,470
relay I'm sure you're all familiar with

569
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,030
key relay when you have a keyless entry

570
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,440
key for your car you get close you can

571
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,300
open it and criminals turn up with a

572
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,700
black box because hacking is being

573
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,190
productized and can unlock and drive

574
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,110
away your vehicle so as a result of it a

575
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,960
lot of people are now investing in

576
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,000
third-party car alarms so additional

577
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,290
layers of security additional

578
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,090
immobilizers additional functionality to

579
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,190
further secure their car great that's a

580
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,870
good idea so we started looking at these

581
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,000
in a little bit more detail and what

582
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,690
really drew my attention was the word

583
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,260
unhackable

584
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,510
now if you currently follow me on

585
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,330
Twitter you'll know that if you use the

586
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,190
word unhackable in your marketing I'm

587
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:23,070
gonna own you it's gonna happen whether

588
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,320
it's me part of my team or whether it's

589
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,210
a group of people we put together never

590
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:32,280
ever use the word unhackable and what

591
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,020
annoyed me is they equated the idea of

592
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,310
being unhackable with the fact they'd

593
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,230
never registered a breach that doesn't

594
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,400
mean you're unhackable it just means you

595
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,200
haven't been hacked yet and there's lots

596
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,090
of mumbo-jumbo stuff that makes no sense

597
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,950
so we started looking at it we started

598
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,390
looking at the mobile apps downloaded it

599
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,130
and we realized that you can do very

600
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,650
similar things with your car alarm as

601
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,990
you can do with your smart vehicle app

602
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,550
so if any of you how to have a high-end

603
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,500
vehicle you might have an app so you can

604
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,000
find it when you've lost it in the car

605
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,200
park and can't remember where it is

606
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,760
so you can do very similar things that

607
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,530
was interesting so what have some fun

608
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,150
with this so I'd like to introduce my

609
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,950
colleague um Vangelis TVs dick ass he's

610
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,090
really worth following on Twitter

611
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,430
there's lots of fun stuff and we filmed

612
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,110
this and the TV guys said like okay

613
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,470
bring him in on on skype but could you

614
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,850
have him put a black hoodie and some

615
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,550
reflective sunglasses on please it's not

616
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,680
normally him but I had to I had to put

617
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,140
this up and we started looking we

618
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,250
started creating a couple of accounts

619
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,200
and we realized just like with the kids

620
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,670
watches there were insecure direct

621
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,530
object references so incorrect

622
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,180
authorization was being applied to user

623
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,890
accounts which means you could mess

624
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,840
around with bits and pieces and start

625
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,870
doing weird things the idle we found in

626
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,360
this case was on the password reset

627
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,870
email so every other action that some

628
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,610
you did with your app was fine it was

629
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,110
authorized and checked that you were you

630
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:49,230
however when you changed the password

631
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,550
reset email address

632
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,230
it didn't correctly authorize that

633
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,670
request which meant we could change it

634
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:56,340
to our email address trigger a password

635
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,560
reset receive the password reset email

636
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,230
change the password lock user out and

637
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,840
take over their car alarm account so

638
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,970
we're now an interesting place um we so

639
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:08,370
problem we've now got is because it was

640
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,290
hardware involved we couldn't just hack

641
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:13,080
someone else's car so we had to go and

642
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,480
fit vehicle alarms expensive vehicle

643
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,370
alarms to our own vehicles and I had to

644
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,540
have a conversation with one of my

645
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,740
colleagues where I said I'd like you to

646
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,290
fit a vulnerable car alarm to your car

647
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,820
that makes it easier to steal you went

648
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,340
okay that's fine Kay that's

649
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,340
not an issue so what we've discovered is

650
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,960
once we've got compromised on the left

651
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,370
hand side there first thing we could do

652
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,440
is we could query the API and we query

653
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,720
the type of vehicle so if you want all

654
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,970
the Lamborghinis you can query them

655
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,350
using the API so you got a nice little

656
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,380
attack list for your criminal next thing

657
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,640
we could do is we could get GPS

658
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,770
coordinates in real time of all the

659
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,720
vehicles so we could track everybody so

660
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,179
we knew where the cars were to steal but

661
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,190
privacy wise also quite worrying too

662
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:57,480
because we know where you are we could

663
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,740
then find a vehicle trigger the

664
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,010
immobilizer remotely set off the panic

665
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,470
alarm so the alarm starts going the vo

666
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,409
nerdwriter stops the vehicle stops it

667
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:12,659
cannot be restarted we can then pop the

668
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:15,720
doors and go and take the keys and take

669
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,820
the car away and in some cases we can

670
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,580
even do it without the keys so that is a

671
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,809
car alarm that makes your car easier to

672
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:28,279
steal like they are any of that one hmm

673
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,049
just to recap that affects at about two

674
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,610
million vehicles the brand was Pandora

675
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,830
we could locate you in real time we

676
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,360
could choose the type of car we want and

677
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,460
unlock and immobilize and D immobilize

678
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,470
the car to order but then some weird

679
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,870
stuff happened we read the manual and

680
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,039
bottom right there to see it says

681
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:47,159
microphone why is there a microphone in

682
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:48,510
a car alarm

683
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,880
it's an unusual thing right apparently

684
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,440
it turns out very much like the e call

685
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,850
functionality you have with modern

686
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,950
vehicles if there's a high G impact it

687
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,600
can automatically dial the emergency

688
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,850
services for you great but of course in

689
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,380
order to interact and speak the

690
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,120
emergency services you need a microphone

691
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,260
great we discovered using the API and

692
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,730
those of you who still remember your

693
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,610
DTMF remember that we could enable the

694
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,409
microphone remotely and listen to 2

695
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:15,899
million people's cars how often do you

696
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:17,370
have a conversation in your car with

697
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,720
your partner or someone else that you

698
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,250
really didn't want anyone else to hear

699
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,289
it's alright your car alarm snoops on

700
00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:26,159
you brilliant we went further anyone

701
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,370
familiar with Viper huge brand in the

702
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,470
u.s. knows Clifford in the UK one the

703
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,419
largest and most respective alarm brands

704
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:37,800
out there blown away

705
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,820
by the very same vulnerability Wow the

706
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,670
car alarms that are making your cars

707
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:46,920
easier to steal now we always go through

708
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,770
responsible disclosure with any vendor

709
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,360
and I have to say we thought that Viper

710
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,000
being a u.s. organization versus Pandora

711
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,800
who are a Russian business we thought

712
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,730
Viper would be first now we tried usual

713
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:03,840
methods emails to contact us phone calls

714
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,910
you should get call centers that data

715
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,050
clue what you're talking about

716
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,550
I'd like to report a security flaw in a

717
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,100
car alarm sorry sir that's not on my

718
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,370
list of questions I can answer but in

719
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,450
the end I found the head of smart

720
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,770
connectivity on LinkedIn dropped him a

721
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,330
line he came back really well-received

722
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:22,890
and they fixed it in three days so you

723
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,450
can fix stuff fast if you're motivated

724
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:28,350
and Pandora the Russians no response I

725
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,450
got a hold of UK importer they were a

726
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:32,550
bit grumpy with me didn't really know

727
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,380
what a security vulnerability was but

728
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,360
blow me they fixed it faster they fixed

729
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,360
the bug in two days across two million

730
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,360
installations that was cool so you can

731
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,070
get there if you try hard fun Hank this

732
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,690
is new stuff I haven't talked about this

733
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,930
publicly so much we could also kill the

734
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,540
engine in some circumstances to order so

735
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,400
we could pick on one of three million

736
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,130
vehicles and kill the engine bringing

737
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,960
the car to a halt imagine you're driving

738
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,350
home by yourself at night remote air of

739
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,760
the country I can track your know where

740
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,100
you are kill your engine great please

741
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,260
put blue to a halt and I can pop your

742
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,200
door locks that's worrying isn't it

743
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,730
there's also direct connectivity between

744
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,410
many of these alarms and the can the

745
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,540
vehicle network of canvas that's to

746
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,490
allow faster configuration so the alarm

747
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,170
can recognize the can messages of the

748
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,610
vehicle brand and automatically

749
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,890
recognize the car type we've also

750
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:29,220
noticed some functionality that allows

751
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,580
you to directly inject from the alarm as

752
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,680
well so we showed some work where we

753
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,480
could take control from the car alarm

754
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,650
API and directly effect this can bus

755
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,540
stability so we could dust the car and

756
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,430
bring it to a halt in some cases there's

757
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,470
also functionality in some because the

758
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,360
alarms allow remote start which requires

759
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,850
a brake pedal press

760
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,550
in some vehicles we found the ability to

761
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,190
actuate the brakes and also tamper with

762
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:59,880
cruise control not so good is it and

763
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,080
something we're working on right now

764
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,330
that's my car parked at terminal 5

765
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,240
little while back it's there again today

766
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,700
we've been looking at vehicle trackers

767
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,020
and we've discovered that the trackers

768
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,490
are there to reduce your insurance

769
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:16,380
premiums because if your cars stolen the

770
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,660
cops can find it again

771
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,220
we found API flaws in their allow us to

772
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,450
rewrite the decision of your vehicle

773
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,180
servers pinched the criminal can make it

774
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,850
look like it's still there or you can

775
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,980
send the cops off on a wild goose chase

776
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,410
for a ghost vehicle that's worrying

777
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,570
isn't it security that makes you less

778
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,460
secure we've also been looking at

779
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,350
aftermarket dongles I think if anyone

780
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,820
here is interested in the security of

781
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,450
canvas

782
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:42,210
maybe you've connected a Bluetooth

783
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,190
module to your onboard diagnostics port

784
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,930
and you can see lots of cool stuff you

785
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,400
see lots more information about your

786
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,410
vehicle there's a really interesting one

787
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,940
going on with Tesla at the moment

788
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,010
Tesla's on-board diagnostics port has

789
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,750
not really connected it's only really

790
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,490
got plus 12 volts and ground and nothing

791
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,170
else so as a result of which people who

792
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,310
want to know more about their vehicles

793
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,610
will typically go behind the big display

794
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,590
the CID and pull out the export to seven

795
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,850
cable and plug straight in their direct

796
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:11,550
powertrain can bus access from a device

797
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:15,270
that has a Bluetooth pin a 1 2 3 4 5 6

798
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:18,600
so you can G locate and go there and

799
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,360
dust people's vehicles we've got

800
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,220
aftermarket dongles on their onboard

801
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,930
diagnostics we've managed to bring our

802
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,210
Tesla to a halt knocked out an entire

803
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:30,120
powertrain and amazingly turned it off

804
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,040
turn it on again back to life it came

805
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,230
though I know one brand if you did that

806
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,270
too that will kill every ECU on the

807
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:39,270
vehicle let's go and have some more fun

808
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:46,410
shall we the word unhackable always gets

809
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,780
my interest and I'd like to go a bit

810
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,160
more detail about some work we did last

811
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,330
year that some of you I hope will have

812
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:54,540
seen I'd like to introduce you to the

813
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,580
bit by show hands they were not a bit

814
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,380
fires really wow you're a love this then

815
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,870
this is the bit fight it is a crypto

816
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:04,690
current

817
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,150
the wallet that is designed for you to

818
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,980
store your cryptocurrency pass phrases

819
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:12,460
and seeds on the wallet securely as well

820
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,200
you know the most common route to

821
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,810
getting crypto currency stolen these

822
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,580
people disclosing or using simple pins

823
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,090
and this is a bit fine hardware

824
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,440
cryptocurrency well I'm gonna read out

825
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,380
the quote on it says the world's first

826
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,990
unhackable storage for cryptocurrency in

827
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:33,510
digital assets quote john mcafee who's a

828
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:37,630
really interesting character if you

829
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,150
haven't read up on john he's a very very

830
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,570
interesting individual and you probably

831
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,370
want to google john mcafee and bath

832
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:51,070
salts that's a good place to start I'd

833
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,330
like to tell you a story that is

834
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,860
probably on the funniest things I think

835
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,250
we've ever done the idea being this is

836
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,360
the bit fight you store your

837
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,800
cryptocurrency seeds on there it's a

838
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,900
concept of a brain wallet so the idea

839
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,210
being is that some the keys are never

840
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,820
stored anywhere except up here so we

841
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,110
started looking at this and the reason

842
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,520
we were interested is that first of all

843
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,800
they claimed their unhackable bad place

844
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,280
to start but they put their money where

845
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,449
their mouth is they said right we're

846
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:18,070
going to put up a hundred thousand bucks

847
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:21,540
for anyone who successfully recovers

848
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,520
passphrase and salts from one of these

849
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,159
whoo I like that can its kind of job

850
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,810
that's right up our street because we do

851
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:31,900
embedded systems okay so we started

852
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,370
doing some work we started looking into

853
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,949
it this bounties IAM not intended to

854
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:39,340
help us because our Security's absolute

855
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,219
oh she's getting more interesting by the

856
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,750
moment isn't it so we started getting

857
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,980
bit further we realized that made a

858
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,290
fatal mistake they claimed the fact they

859
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,750
were unhackable was the same as one very

860
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,760
specific attack they said we're not

861
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,250
vulnerable to X but by that we're

862
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,630
therefore not unhackable that's a big

863
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,210
mistake to make so we got hold of one

864
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:01,780
there are 120 bucks and started looking

865
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,800
in the back and a bit that made me

866
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,350
chuckle is it has an entropy source the

867
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,720
seeding of crypto which is a six-sided

868
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,210
die Wow okay can I have to roll that

869
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,730
enough and also affirm ram cryptid CPU

870
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:15,700
now I've been in embedded for 23 years I

871
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,650
don't know what firmware encrypted CPU

872
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:18,130
is

873
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,750
I've never seen one so we put a team

874
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,210
together and that is my colleague cyber

875
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:24,460
Gibbons well worth the follow by the way

876
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,740
he's recently updated avatar he's much

877
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,320
cuddlier now definitely worth a follow

878
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,430
if you want to know about embedded

879
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:34,120
system security he is fascinating we put

880
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:39,040
together a team six of us at PTP and had

881
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,750
another 15 researchers from around the

882
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,730
world with security expertise in wallet

883
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,500
security and this is where things

884
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,950
started happening we asked John McAfee

885
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,690
directly on Twitter openly on Twitter

886
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:55,240
about the claim of unhak ability the

887
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,640
fact he stated there was no memory to

888
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,220
hack all the monies stored in a

889
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,570
memorable phrase of the choice in your

890
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,790
head okay well if there's no memory to

891
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:06,160
hack what's in here okay what's the

892
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,340
point of this if it's all in your head

893
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,530
we then went further asked him about the

894
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,150
lack of memory to hack me said there is

895
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,730
no RAM on the bit fight there is no ramp

896
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,680
ok that's interesting it won't it be

897
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,540
even further it cannot be hacked there

898
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,040
is no software on the device and no

899
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,210
memory how's it work

900
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:28,640
okay a lot of bath salts going on here

901
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,070
so we opened it up and I don't know

902
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,710
about you but I recognize that as a

903
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:41,370
gigabyte DDR Ram memory okay let's go a

904
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:44,790
little bit further when I say there's no

905
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:48,230
memory what I meant

906
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:52,800
there's nothing about seeds and keys

907
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,540
replied John okay that's fine we're

908
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,470
thinking this must be quite an

909
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,420
interesting crypto wallet don't need a

910
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,100
hundred and twenty dollars confusing

911
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,050
device much more costly to manufacture

912
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:06,600
than ordinary hardware what Wow so we've

913
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,270
got one started looking at it and as

914
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,210
soon as you got to back off whereas it's

915
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:29,580
a mediatek mt6752 tech mt6582 NT dollars

916
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:34,080
in bulk charging us 120 bucks so we

917
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,820
pointed this out to John John it's a

918
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,220
phone it's absolutely not a cell phone

919
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,720
or anything we've resembling a cell

920
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,830
phone because all cell phones are

921
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:45,120
hackable okay so anybody that looks a

922
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,660
bit phony to me and that looks like it

923
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,650
might be a bit of a phone and on their

924
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,810
own website the image that describes the

925
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:57,600
bit fights called smart phone and in

926
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,640
their manual they refer to it as a phone

927
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:07,589
okay but if I then disowned John McAfee

928
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:10,390
this is all getting a bit mad I think

929
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,859
this is fun we got something on the

930
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:13,000
backfoot let's have some more fun

931
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,880
so having disowned them let's go and

932
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,019
look at some of the fun stuff we found

933
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:18,369
let's do the tech stuff what did we

934
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:21,069
actually get to this is the product of

935
00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:24,730
about four weeks work by 15 people in

936
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,980
different areas of the world I want to

937
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,480
show you the fun stuff we got to very

938
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,269
quickly we realized mediatek 65 80 it

939
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:34,990
uses a screen multiplexer so your input

940
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,329
when you put your carrot carrot strokes

941
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:39,609
on the touch screen it sends them to the

942
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:43,809
CPU over I to see unencrypted so if you

943
00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:44,859
want to do there's a really easy hack

944
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:48,960
you could just tap the i2c interface and

945
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,420
sniff the keystrokes is there entered if

946
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,410
you want to do something fun like a

947
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,880
supply chain attack you just reduce the

948
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,950
size the battery put in so maybe an

949
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,720
extra GSM module that ported those out

950
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,940
elsewhere so that was the easy one but

951
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,740
then we were as being a 65 80 it's not

952
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,039
the best-known phone for its security

953
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:08,009
because it's got an unlocked bootloader

954
00:39:08,009 --> 00:39:10,779
which you can't lock which isn't great

955
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:12,430
so you got access to file system bang or

956
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,619
in a good place now good that's not the

957
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:15,519
best thing to do

958
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,099
let's go a bit further so then things

959
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:20,140
started hotting up a bit with John

960
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,579
McAfee and bit Phi at this point and

961
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:24,339
they decided right they had $100,000

962
00:39:24,339 --> 00:39:27,000
bounty but now yeah we've really started

963
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,069
needling a bit and they upped the bounty

964
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:32,950
to court over a million dollars going

965
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:36,640
you cannot hack this device so for a bit

966
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,880
of fun along the way we just to really

967
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,349
annoy them ran doom on it

968
00:39:43,769 --> 00:39:45,940
so we've now routed the bit fight

969
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,009
they're in a good place now aren't we

970
00:39:48,009 --> 00:39:51,039
so before to show you something I'm

971
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:52,299
gonna stop this and go back to the

972
00:39:52,299 --> 00:39:54,759
beginning because the attack we found

973
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,440
was actually every USB I'll come back to

974
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,539
it a little bit later but we didn't want

975
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:01,150
to put bit fight on to the scent of what

976
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,440
we were doing so you see those wires

977
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,279
hooked up to an STI SDM reader they

978
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,440
don't do anything they're just tacked on

979
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,870
with sticky tape

980
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,240
this was just to make sure bit Phi

981
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,710
weren't following what we're doing at

982
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:17,970
the time so a little bit further we've

983
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:18,660
routed it

984
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,920
now of course to route it you're going

985
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,420
to need to reboot it so you potentially

986
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,740
going to be wiping memory at that point

987
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,840
but the next place we wanted to go was

988
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,490
think about the device over Wi-Fi so

989
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,930
it's got a Wi-Fi module it talks to your

990
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,250
home access point let's see what we can

991
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,250
do over Wi-Fi they claim very clearly

992
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,470
that you could not man the middle any

993
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,810
transaction over Wi-Fi because it was

994
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,980
signed blah blah blah

995
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,720
so we discovered it was trivial to man

996
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,060
the middle and then modify transactions

997
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,390
so you sent money other places so

998
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,430
another claim those utterly discredited

999
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:53,040
by them however the terms of the bounty

1000
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,500
were extracting passphrase and seed from

1001
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,330
a device that had been shipped to us by

1002
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:01,790
them so it's going to be in flight

1003
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:04,290
probably for three or four five days by

1004
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,300
which time anything in memories like to

1005
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,550
have degraded so what we need to do is a

1006
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:11,040
successful cold boot attack in order to

1007
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,550
boot it and recover so what we have here

1008
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,910
have recorded it on video and I'm gonna

1009
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:20,040
go write the end don't worry about

1010
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,740
yakety-yak write the very end after

1011
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,220
about three to four work four hours

1012
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,630
month weeks of work sorry we

1013
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,970
successfully recovered the passphrase

1014
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:32,220
and salt from the bit fight through cold

1015
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:36,990
boot satisfying the bug bounty wow this

1016
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:37,650
is good

1017
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,330
I don't ever you I'm thinking about what

1018
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,620
I'm going to spend this money on this is

1019
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:44,060
gonna be a good time but instead of

1020
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:48,450
acknowledging this paying out they then

1021
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:52,290
threatened us wow this is a really

1022
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:53,610
unusual response time we've had the

1023
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,900
occasional cease and desist from

1024
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,580
companies didn't understand but never

1025
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,750
overt physical threat so things they

1026
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,670
start getting even weirder John McAfee

1027
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,620
took even more bath salts couldn't type

1028
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,360
anymore we don't know what gassing a

1029
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,490
ramen is and I can only imagine it's

1030
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:09,240
also correct

1031
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,150
but no one stole my coins it's all

1032
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,800
rubbish so we started needling little

1033
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,170
bit further and John McAfee finally red

1034
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:20,130
relented and said ok come to my ranch in

1035
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,570
southern US

1036
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:25,300
and you can demonstrate this to us we

1037
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,640
like not sure about that John you're

1038
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,500
quite a character you've been you know

1039
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,960
there's reports of you having fired guns

1040
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,520
randomly worth off your head on bath

1041
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,670
salts so we thought about this thought

1042
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,560
you know well maybe we could but then

1043
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,980
the next thing did was tweeted this this

1044
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,720
is John Mackey's personal protection

1045
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,750
squad like ok I'm now feeling really

1046
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,720
nervous about flying for USA so we

1047
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,010
offered him to come to the UK but he

1048
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,090
turned us down

1049
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:55,330
so did we get the money did we hell and

1050
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:56,680
to be honest it was never about the

1051
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,450
money if the money did turn up we'd

1052
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,040
already agreed as a group to give it all

1053
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,720
to charity anyway but we didn't think it

1054
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,040
was going to happen it wasn't going to

1055
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,920
come did we get the money did we heck no

1056
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,080
money turned up but what we did get was

1057
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,940
a pony award at last his black hat the

1058
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,340
lamest vendor response which I am super

1059
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,150
proud of

1060
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,330
now if I have changed their Twitter

1061
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,400
handle is now used to be bit by six it's

1062
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,050
now the bit five if you wanna have fun

1063
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:29,150
do follow them because they went really

1064
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,830
quiet for about six months as they went

1065
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:32,180
back and really textured and went back

1066
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:35,540
to basics and they just got back on the

1067
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,520
bath salts and I now started get

1068
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,350
aggressive on Twitter again this is

1069
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:42,350
great so we and many other people who've

1070
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:43,820
involved in this project we start to

1071
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,740
needle them again because they're making

1072
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,890
outrageous claims again and again and

1073
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,090
again I don't know why they feel they

1074
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:52,460
need to do this it's crazy it's just

1075
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,510
asking for trouble

1076
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:55,040
and there's a little bit of me going

1077
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,140
well hang on it's only what about a

1078
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,850
month and a half until blackhat maybe

1079
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:01,960
they want another pony this year get in

1080
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:07,220
so some advice for any sort of hardware

1081
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,070
project you might consider one of the

1082
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:13,280
most fundamental flaws IOT developers

1083
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,930
make is they don't get their base

1084
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:17,300
hardware right the one thing you can't

1085
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,950
fix in the field is choosing the wrong

1086
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:20,870
chipset if it doesn't have a trusted

1087
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,130
execution environment doesn't have a

1088
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,080
good entropy source it doesn't have any

1089
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,380
sort of storage or there's a known CLP

1090
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,030
bypass you're screwed

1091
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:31,160
you can have two product recall if you

1092
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,540
can't update over-the-air you're stuffed

1093
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,530
you're going to have to do a product

1094
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:35,990
recall or just hold on and pray if

1095
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:37,130
you're going to get firmware developed

1096
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:38,420
get it develop my people who have a clue

1097
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,850
and software if you mobile app make sure

1098
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,350
that all those calls are correctly

1099
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,640
authorized make sure that the

1100
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,960
organization that's doing it for you

1101
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,740
knows what oh wasp is let alone follows

1102
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,780
a secure development lifecycle Wow

1103
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,810
crazy right get a vise really it really

1104
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:55,550
early on and please whatever dude don't

1105
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,830
claim a product is unhackable as part of

1106
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:59,390
your marketing campaign because it's

1107
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:01,550
going to end badly I promise you I will

1108
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:06,740
be there waiting but also what makes me

1109
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,210
sad is that things don't really change

1110
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:10,190
and that's what's frustrated me over the

1111
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:12,740
last few years and this is a piece of

1112
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:15,730
work we did in 2014

1113
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:19,910
five years ago and you might remember

1114
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:22,400
Tesco did a really cool tablet as a very

1115
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,110
cheap Android tablet called the huddle

1116
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:26,120
it was based on the rockchip chip rock

1117
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,260
chip chipset and they sold it for

1118
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:32,060
equivalent of about sixty pounds if you

1119
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,859
use their loyalty vouchers and the test

1120
00:45:33,859 --> 00:45:35,509
club car scheme great idea thought it's

1121
00:45:35,509 --> 00:45:38,269
really really nice product actually got

1122
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:39,920
a lot of tablets into people into kids

1123
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,440
great really good

1124
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,999
however they built it on the rockchip

1125
00:45:43,999 --> 00:45:46,549
firmware on the rockchip cpu sorry which

1126
00:45:46,549 --> 00:45:50,119
had an own bypass in there on their

1127
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:52,940
flash mode now in most flash modes for

1128
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:56,930
any CPU you'd expect to have write

1129
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:58,729
access because you're trying to reflash

1130
00:45:58,729 --> 00:46:01,849
it with new firmware potentially but the

1131
00:46:01,849 --> 00:46:04,400
flaw that rock chip had is in that flash

1132
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,670
mode you also had read access so you

1133
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,859
could read arbitrary memory and we

1134
00:46:09,859 --> 00:46:13,039
showed there a really little too simple

1135
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:14,180
trick all we had to do is hold down

1136
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,609
volume down and put a pin in to reset

1137
00:46:16,609 --> 00:46:19,150
port plug in USB and you could read

1138
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:22,309
arbitrary data from memory now we

1139
00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:25,369
reported that to Tesco and they went

1140
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:28,880
thanks that's really cool we've got the

1141
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,829
huddle to about to ship and we're going

1142
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,119
to pull the huddle on straight away is

1143
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:35,299
that ok wow what a cool vendor yeah and

1144
00:46:35,299 --> 00:46:36,259
we'll put up some new firmware for the

1145
00:46:36,259 --> 00:46:40,249
existing users cool five years ago five

1146
00:46:40,249 --> 00:46:43,009
years ago this happened so we're

1147
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:47,380
thinking surely no vendors who truly

1148
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,479
understands security what ever consider

1149
00:46:50,479 --> 00:46:54,259
building a product on a CPU with known

1150
00:46:54,259 --> 00:46:56,569
flash mate floor so I'd like you to

1151
00:46:56,569 --> 00:46:58,789
introduce you to the VTech init app

1152
00:46:58,789 --> 00:47:01,670
VTech that vendor who's had an amazing

1153
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:03,709
time of doing security really really

1154
00:47:03,709 --> 00:47:08,690
badly got breached and this is one I

1155
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,249
bought quite recently actually so here

1156
00:47:10,249 --> 00:47:12,699
we are five years down the line and

1157
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:17,329
we're still finding a vendor producing

1158
00:47:17,329 --> 00:47:21,140
product smart devices for kids based

1159
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:26,449
upon a chipset with a vulnerable flash

1160
00:47:26,449 --> 00:47:29,209
mode but what make me laugh the most is

1161
00:47:29,209 --> 00:47:31,819
when I took the backup I found that the

1162
00:47:31,819 --> 00:47:34,309
OS is on a removable microSD card that

1163
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:38,329
they superglued in certain moments with

1164
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:40,459
the craft knife to remove it and get

1165
00:47:40,459 --> 00:47:44,960
access to all the data and even worse

1166
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,860
everything was running as root five

1167
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,590
years down the line from the original

1168
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:55,950
vulnerability things aren't improving I

1169
00:47:55,950 --> 00:48:00,030
think that he's really really poor so

1170
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:03,180
I'd like to wrap this up now by looking

1171
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,630
at hopefully some of the good news that

1172
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:10,530
faces us a little bit of good news in

1173
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:12,510
the U we have an Easter that was at a

1174
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:15,020
briefing with a nice RSA in

1175
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:18,120
january/february and there's been lots

1176
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,710
of great documentation put out I think

1177
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:21,450
we were quoted in some of these good

1178
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:23,730
practice guides and there is a move

1179
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,260
towards the certification framework and

1180
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,790
here's how the security act is a really

1181
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:28,830
good step forward but at the moment as I

1182
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:31,080
understand it please call me out if you

1183
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,850
think I'm wrong it applies to critical

1184
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:34,950
national infrastructure it's great but

1185
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:37,800
doesn't apply to IOT yet and the last I

1186
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,170
heard was that regulation is perhaps not

1187
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:43,260
until 2023 another four years of this

1188
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,710
current chaos of poor IOT product

1189
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:49,920
security in the UK we have the

1190
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,970
Department for Culture Media and Sport

1191
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,800
we've actually done some really cool

1192
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,740
stuff and I support this they started

1193
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,630
off by a juror issuing some good

1194
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,210
practice guidance so 13 fundamental

1195
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:02,070
principles towards basic security and

1196
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:04,740
just last month they've gone out for

1197
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,210
consultation on regulation on the top

1198
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:08,730
three of those now it might not sound

1199
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:10,910
like very much but you know it's a start

1200
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:13,500
not having things like shared common

1201
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,750
default passwords so backdoor accounts

1202
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:17,130
or everything that we find everywhere

1203
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:20,430
and we're hoping that we'll see some

1204
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:23,280
regulation in the UK next year and I

1205
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,620
think that's a really really big step

1206
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,850
forward because I think what we've shown

1207
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:30,690
is the market forces and not driving

1208
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:33,120
behavior of manufacturers yet however

1209
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,580
the one I'm most impressed with is

1210
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,900
California Senate bills Senate bill

1211
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,970
three to seven it's actually worth a

1212
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:41,520
read it's a good document and a bit I'm

1213
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,350
so proud of is that one of the senators

1214
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:45,690
who proposed this bill quoted our work

1215
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:48,030
on my friend Kayla as one of the reasons

1216
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:50,730
behind getting this going and I think

1217
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:53,040
that's really cool it becomes law on the

1218
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,900
first of January 2020 and makes

1219
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,030
reasonable security features mandatory

1220
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,420
now my only concern about

1221
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,460
is what is reasonable security feature

1222
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,770
but in fairness nest in the USA are

1223
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:05,200
working right now on reasonable actually

1224
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,059
is although I have to say I think

1225
00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:08,380
there'll be quite a bit of case law

1226
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,470
required and test cases to define what

1227
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:12,750
the level of security that is

1228
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:15,460
appropriate for consumer devices at the

1229
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,500
moment there is some debate about

1230
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:23,829
whether this applies to a car is a car a

1231
00:50:23,829 --> 00:50:27,609
smart device I'll argue yes as many of

1232
00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:29,940
the attributes that my friend Kayla does

1233
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,799
snoop on you knows where you are other

1234
00:50:32,799 --> 00:50:34,450
fun things so that's really good

1235
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:35,920
progress I think that's definitely going

1236
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,680
the right direction there have been some

1237
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,859
legal cases as well now my friend Kayla

1238
00:50:41,859 --> 00:50:44,380
was banned very quickly after we

1239
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:46,690
published our research a German lawyer

1240
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:51,130
called Stephane Hessel noticed that the

1241
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:53,500
connection to my friend Kayla meant that

1242
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,030
other people could be overheard on the

1243
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:57,520
microphone and that violates a German

1244
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,440
telecommunications privacy law from 1947

1245
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,250
he pointed this out to a

1246
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,530
telecommunications regulator and the

1247
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:07,720
next day they put out an alert saying

1248
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,690
Kayla is now illegal to own in Germany

1249
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:12,130
which made it really exciting a talk in

1250
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:15,880
Munich but that's good we're also

1251
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,730
starting to see her banned by active

1252
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:21,280
data protection regulators so she's been

1253
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,660
banned in most of the Scandinavian

1254
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,309
countries in the Netherlands you can

1255
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:26,049
hardly buyer in the UK anymore and

1256
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:28,270
that's great so we've seen lots of

1257
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:30,670
different laws used to effectively ban

1258
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,349
smart product that isn't secure and

1259
00:51:32,349 --> 00:51:36,849
that's good we have started to see some

1260
00:51:36,849 --> 00:51:40,000
class actions in the USA which i think

1261
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,950
is fantastic we started to see some

1262
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:44,290
class actions brought against some

1263
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:45,940
manufacturers who were exceeding the

1264
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,980
terms of their own terms of conditions

1265
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,579
which is great fantastic to see people

1266
00:51:51,579 --> 00:51:55,329
using laws now the only sad bit is that

1267
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:59,920
some the two that are settled that I'm

1268
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,869
aware of right now both smart adults sex

1269
00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:07,900
toys that were collecting too much data

1270
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,780
about how you are using the product and

1271
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:13,530
where you were using

1272
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,940
and I don't know about you I'd be really

1273
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,680
uncomfortable if you found someone was

1274
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:23,800
tracking your thing yeah we won't go

1275
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,090
into that anymore shall we I did say it

1276
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:26,260
was about backdoors but I didn't mean

1277
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,830
those back doors

1278
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:38,590
anyway that brings me to a close I'd

1279
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:40,120
like to thank you that is my Twitter if

1280
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,560
you want to follow my cell for cyber

1281
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,990
Gibbons really worth it in lots and lots

1282
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:45,700
of advice tips and tricks on a bedded

1283
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,770
system security the state of regulation

1284
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:49,570
so far and there's also a hit blog

1285
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,430
full of lots of interesting things that

1286
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:53,200
we're doing at the moment we've got some

1287
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,910
wonderful disclosures coming up right

1288
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:56,320
now including another company they claim

1289
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,120
they are unhackable on Friday and I

1290
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,560
cannot wait to disclose that but I've

1291
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,840
got do the right thing and wait thank

1292
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,520
you

1293
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:12,100
[Applause]

1294
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:15,710
long way to come up thank you very much

gen-pop big time

1297
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:22,550
I think there are microphones in the

1298
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:26,960
aisle somewhere I hope yes there are

1299
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,500
micro all right down there any further

1300
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,050
back or the okay so if you have a

1301
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:35,630
question come to the microphone and far

1302
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:41,450
away come on it's early in the

1303
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:42,860
conference you can't claim to be tired

1304
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,200
now we have someone there heading this

1305
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:45,620
way

1306
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:50,900
yep hello again thanks for you talked so

1307
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,790
I mean you point out the regulation

1308
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:54,860
coming through and everything but

1309
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:57,260
there's a huge tail of devices out there

1310
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,300
right now Anderson so how do you how do

1311
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,280
we think we address the issue that it's

1312
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,870
time to market it's a critical thing of

1313
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:05,840
the large huge number of devices are

1314
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,420
already out there yes a huge problem

1315
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:09,860
particularly Asamoah because most the

1316
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,540
auto air EMS have actually really got on

1317
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:12,620
top of security they've got great

1318
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:13,790
security teams they're doing the right

1319
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:15,230
thing but the problem they have is this

1320
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:18,350
lag so from you know from clean sheet to

1321
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:19,820
delivery of a new vehicle is gonna be

1322
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,000
three years so how do you deal with that

1323
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,890
existing basis of vehicles out there so

1324
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:27,320
the answer is I think all we can do is

1325
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,120
keep applying pressure and whether it's

1326
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,920
pressure from regulators saying look

1327
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,000
we're gonna regulate for don't sort your

1328
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,830
act out or its security research is

1329
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:35,660
going we're gonna drag you through the

1330
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:37,460
media if you don't get it right

1331
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,650
so sadly there's not a great deal we can

1332
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:42,200
do the existing products although I

1333
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,070
would love to see the right to return

1334
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:47,540
because that's a huge incentive isn't it

1335
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:50,000
if a product you bought is proven

1336
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,670
insecure I'd love to see the ability to

1337
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:54,230
return it so how do you deal with like

1338
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,000
the disposable IOT for things like

1339
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,160
agriculture and other areas like that I

1340
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,390
mean there's something some things which

1341
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:01,490
you've just got practically no control

1342
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:03,620
over whatsoever so yeah I think at the

1343
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:06,020
moment was stuffed frankly I think

1344
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,960
there's so much poor security and so

1345
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,840
much IOT already that all we can do is

1346
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,220
drive forward I think trying to

1347
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,110
retrospectively apply security is going

1348
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:17,390
to be very very difficult all we can do

1349
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:19,220
is hopefully shine a light on it and

1350
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:19,620
encourage

1351
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:24,750
not to use the bad ones thank you so you

1352
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:27,360
point out early on that a large part of

1353
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,070
this is coming from the chip

1354
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:30,690
manufacturers and the software

1355
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:34,050
manufacturers yet at this point you're

1356
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:36,120
attacking and that's maybe not the right

1357
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,360
term but your attack surface is the end

1358
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:43,020
product how do we push this back farther

1359
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:46,170
in the process and actually make the

1360
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:47,370
people who are creating the kits

1361
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:50,940
creating the chips make them make

1362
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:53,820
security part of their process from the

1363
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:55,590
beginning so that's a really good

1364
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:57,120
question actually so many of the big

1365
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,830
chip vendors the arms and microchips yes

1366
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:00,510
teasing this of this world do actually

1367
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:02,550
all produce really good secure chipsets

1368
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:04,530
you know with lots of great security

1369
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:05,810
functionality which is fantastic

1370
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:08,400
problems has until recently has been a

1371
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,860
bit of a price differential there so

1372
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:12,840
encouraging the manufacturers of the

1373
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,880
products so the device manufacturers

1374
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,160
there make me understand why it's worth

1375
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,710
paying a few more cents for a better

1376
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,150
chip with all this functionality is a

1377
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:23,340
really good place to go however I think

1378
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,990
actually for most IOT product

1379
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:26,670
manufacturers the key is not to try and

1380
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:29,600
do all yourself outsource the platform

1381
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,800
outsource the development to people who

1382
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,990
understand at the moment I think what I

1383
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:35,520
tried to show in the talk was that

1384
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,890
outsourcing to the wrong people is

1385
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:39,680
what's causing many of these problems

1386
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:44,280
thank you very much thank you coming up

1387
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,930
your national cybersecurity Center

1388
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:50,070
Finland just wondering what is your take

1389
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:54,300
on the situation of automotive IOT

1390
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,500
security I mean the product life of

1391
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,720
present-day cars you can easily counter

1392
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,810
they we have those courses that are sold

1393
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:06,030
out now they are on the street at for

1394
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:10,080
10-15 years at least some and you have

1395
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,680
to support them and and we are getting a

1396
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:17,030
number of remote control or remote

1397
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:20,420
monitoring hookups there and all the

1398
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:25,110
automate eat equal systems there how do

1399
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:27,330
you find the how do you find it

1400
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:30,540
manufacturers taking the automotive IRT

1401
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:32,610
security situation okay so I spent the

1402
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:34,980
week before last in Detroit and actually

1403
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,060
the manufacturers are taking it very

1404
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,890
seriously but they still have the same

1405
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:43,110
problem with legacy so majority of

1406
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:44,700
automotive manufacturers have got

1407
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,410
security pretty much nailed but they're

1408
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:47,730
going through a problem of now trying to

1409
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:50,550
retrofit security so their existing

1410
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,870
product range and that's a real

1411
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:53,550
challenge that's the hardest bit of it

1412
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:54,840
it's not so much started from clean

1413
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,670
sheet and going let's build a secure

1414
00:57:56,670 --> 00:57:58,980
vehicle which Tesla had a pretty good

1415
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,330
garret it's not perfect but it's better

1416
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:03,090
than many how do you think oh well we've

1417
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:05,880
got all these legacy ECU's and issues

1418
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,860
and connectivity and then retrofitting

1419
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,750
it that's the hard bit and I get a great

1420
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:12,150
example of the challenges for example

1421
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:13,680
the the mega Maus transponder hack you

1422
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,060
might remember that was kept quiet for

1423
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:17,040
two years because it took VW two years

1424
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,860
to get all the cars in to their service

1425
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:21,420
centers to get the software upgraded

1426
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,280
that's less of a problem now now that we

1427
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,870
have telematics so you can reply the

1428
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,700
updates over the air and I'm sure you've

1429
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,800
all seen your car pop up in the morning

1430
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,300
go I've got you software for you great

1431
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,480
it's gonna take 15 minutes to apply not

1432
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,670
so great I want to go to the train

1433
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:37,260
station I'm in a hurry so there are huge

1434
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:38,490
problems but they are being dealt with

1435
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:41,940
yeah but I would like to get my car to

1436
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,710
report a service update while I'm

1437
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:46,250
driving 100 kilometers power and Road

1438
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:50,250
yes that's not such a good place I agree

1439
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:51,540
it's a huge challenge of the industry

1440
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,130
but in fairness and I say this is a

1441
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:54,540
highly critical security researcher

1442
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:56,670
actually the automotive industry are on

1443
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:58,590
it and they are working really hard in

1444
00:58:58,590 --> 00:58:59,700
it as well so I think there's a little

1445
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:02,130
bit of credit but they do have a huge

1446
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:08,520
install base problem to deal with so my

1447
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,810
questions aren't that car is it's more

1448
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:12,540
of potentially if it was also the start

1449
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:14,850
of a philosophical debate when you go

1450
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:19,400
back to the children devices our

1451
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,260
generation is coming up just starting to

1452
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:26,340
look and be more attracted and dependent

1453
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,590
on technology to do things that we

1454
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:31,770
should be doing as humans and connecting

1455
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:34,620
with our children say I mean aren't we

1456
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:37,050
just like adding a layer of abstraction

1457
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:38,140
and

1458
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:42,460
like pushing off the as users pushing

1459
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,920
off the problem so wouldn't the argument

1460
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,289
be that we should be teaching people how

1461
00:59:47,289 --> 00:59:51,460
to how to effectively or probably use

1462
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,920
these devices or properly evaluate why

1463
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,930
they actually need these devices so

1464
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:58,210
that's a really really good point so

1465
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:02,079
much consumer IOT how much do we

1466
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:05,559
actually need how much do you need to

1467
01:00:05,559 --> 01:00:08,890
ball your kettle remotely at about you

1468
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:10,450
my kettle doesn't take very long to boil

1469
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:13,119
so why do I need to boil it remotely why

1470
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:15,339
do I need to call it on the train home

1471
01:00:15,339 --> 01:00:17,200
it's going to take me 30 seconds when I

1472
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,289
get there so I'd ask everyone to

1473
01:00:20,289 --> 01:00:22,299
consider what is the business case the

1474
01:00:22,299 --> 01:00:23,859
personal business case for buying these

1475
01:00:23,859 --> 01:00:27,749
smart things do you need a smart toilet

1476
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:32,200
I've seen one tried to buy one to pen

1477
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,630
test it but do we need these things and

1478
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:36,460
I think there are some cases where there

1479
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:38,410
are real clear business benefits so for

1480
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:40,660
example allowing the elderly to live

1481
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:42,640
assisted by themselves much longer I

1482
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,799
think some great ideas there I think in

1483
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:46,119
health care telematics there's so much

1484
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:47,710
we can learn about the populations

1485
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,119
health care and how we can improve it

1486
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:51,130
and I think there are lots of different

1487
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:52,569
benefits but I think we also need to

1488
01:00:52,569 --> 01:00:55,450
stop getting too excited about having a

1489
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:58,839
smart hot tub did we need it and I think

1490
01:00:58,839 --> 01:01:01,569
if we are as a society going to go you

1491
01:01:01,569 --> 01:01:03,009
know what yeah we're going to do small

1492
01:01:03,009 --> 01:01:05,410
everything but I think we need to accept

1493
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:06,730
that needs to be a cost of training

1494
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:09,190
people to understand how to do security

1495
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:10,989
themselves because right now consumers

1496
01:01:10,989 --> 01:01:14,950
don't have a clue and I think many IT

1497
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:16,989
manufacturers are exploiting that lack

1498
01:01:16,989 --> 01:01:19,960
of awareness to sell them cheap insecure

1499
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:25,809
products so potentially building on that

1500
01:01:25,809 --> 01:01:28,119
statement do you think that we'll see

1501
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:30,220
product vendors start to reduce the

1502
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:33,519
functionality because the business case

1503
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:35,470
is no longer there once they understand

1504
01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:37,239
how much it costs to build the security

1505
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:40,390
in so I'm gonna turn that question this

1506
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:42,999
head because I actually disagree that it

1507
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:44,319
costs a great that money to build a

1508
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,900
security in so when we look at most the

1509
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,160
products they've actually got all the

1510
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,299
functionality they need in them it just

1511
01:01:49,299 --> 01:01:51,099
there's been a few errors made along the

1512
01:01:51,099 --> 01:01:51,310
way

1513
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:53,260
with the exception of perhaps the smart

1514
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:54,720
hot tub which had no authorization

1515
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,220
process at all everything else we've

1516
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:59,620
looked at has all the functionality it's

1517
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:02,290
just been done badly so I don't think it

1518
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:03,790
would have cost much more to have done

1519
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:06,460
that securely I'd also argue that as we

1520
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:09,430
start to see economies of scale as more

1521
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:11,320
and more smart platform providers become

1522
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,750
used I think we'll see it easier to get

1523
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:16,390
a product to market because there is

1524
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:18,700
scale and when a new device manufacturer

1525
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,560
comes to market go right I'm going to

1526
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,960
use that platform it's easy to implement

1527
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,360
it's cheap to implement I'll be there to

1528
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,880
market faster than trying to roll my own

1529
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:30,790
and frankly making methods mess of the

1530
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:32,620
security so I actually think that

1531
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:36,460
bringing in secure platforms is the way

1532
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:38,440
forward it gets product to market faster

1533
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,030
and it means we don't find security

1534
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:45,760
getting in the way of innovation to get

1535
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,630
another one yes just a quick comment

1536
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:52,840
that my biggest concerns with the IOT

1537
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,090
market is actually the scale there and

1538
01:02:55,090 --> 01:02:57,070
especially with when you think with

1539
01:02:57,070 --> 01:03:00,730
Mirai I mean the sheer volume that you

1540
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:02,700
the off traffic that you can generate

1541
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:06,670
through the whole installed IOT base

1542
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:09,820
just take couple of Chinese cameras do

1543
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:13,000
do that is among us and I'm and we're

1544
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,820
just starting to see where this is going

1545
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:18,310
to be heading and he's starting being in

1546
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:20,950
uncontrollable low at some point

1547
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:22,810
generally that's a really really good

1548
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:25,420
point so since Mirai was first built

1549
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:26,800
we've been watching lots of different

1550
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,420
IOT botnets be built and I'm sure many

1551
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:31,660
of you track them as well what blows my

1552
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:34,240
mind that we've seen no one really use a

1553
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,060
botnet in the same way that mirrors

1554
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:39,310
being used we've seen DDoS but we've

1555
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:41,800
seen botnets ten hundred hundred times

1556
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,260
the scale of what Mirai was no one's

1557
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:46,570
really used them in anger and that's

1558
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:47,770
what I'm surprised about I don't know

1559
01:03:47,770 --> 01:03:49,780
why that hasn't happened because you'd

1560
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:52,240
expect it to been done there are big

1561
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:55,350
botnets out there made of consumer IOT

1562
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:57,370
but no-one's really use them in anger

1563
01:03:57,370 --> 01:04:00,330
and I don't know why

1564
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:09,450
okay I'm not sure if that's a positive

1565
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:11,700
note to ender I think things that

1566
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,620
sounded to me like things could be worse

1567
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:15,450
but there was the platform point which

1568
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:17,880
is definitely a positive so Ken thank

1569
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,290
you so much for getting our corners off

1570
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:20,010
to a great start

1571
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:23,550
I'm so glad I wasn't behind you in the

1572
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:27,150
security queue at Heathrow when we won't

1573
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:29,220
talk about that and we know when I said

1574
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:31,170
I was okay with him flying up this

1575
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:33,420
morning before the conference I've been

1576
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:34,980
busily tracking the play in the fact

1577
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:36,870
that he might not get on the plane

1578
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:39,080
hadn't actually featured in my

1579
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:41,730
calculations but thank you very much

1580
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:42,690
indeed

1581
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:47,270
we now have a coffee break as you leave

1582
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:50,840
take a good look at this auditorium as

1583
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:55,980
you look back as I am looking at because

1584
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:57,960
after the break it will look a bit

1585
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:04,050
different this is a really really fun

1586
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:08,640
conference center the coffee is keep

1587
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,800
going down the escalators the escalators

1588
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,390
should now be going the reverse

1589
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:14,160
direction to what they were this morning

1590
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,140
all the way down into the basement and

1591
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:19,350
then head that way and you will find

1592
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:22,500
coffee we start again with three plane

1593
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,300
three parallel sessions which are up

1594
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:28,260
here through the same Lobby and there

1595
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:31,380
are I think the workshops start one

1596
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:34,320
floor down if you want to attend those

1597
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:37,010
have a great conference thank you

1598
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:45,269
[Applause]
