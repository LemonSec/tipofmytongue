1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,270
look at her bio has more four letter

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,750
acronyms that she's involved in leading

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,849
and guiding than I think anybody else I

4
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,519
know I always find out absolutely

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,219
fascinating to listen to and to talk to

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,550
and she's got a great title for the

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,660
morning after the conference dinner so

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:35,399
medica good morning everyone and yeah it

9
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,800
was very interesting when Andrew asked

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,260
me a year ago literally it was June of

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,910
last year whether or not I'd give a

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,070
keynote I was asking you know do you

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,170
mind I mean can I do it in the morning

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,940
the beginning of the week because I'm

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,649
heading off to the ICANN meeting in

16
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,250
Morocco

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,190
well he said absolutely no problem and

18
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,289
then what happened a couple months later

19
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,690
was I was asked to do the keynote at TNC

20
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,710
in Estonia I'm Estonian and so I pleaded

21
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,290
and very kindly asked can I do both and

22
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,260
he then slotted me today and little did

23
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,030
I know how appropriate the title would

24
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,490
be even for the day after the the social

25
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,150
so waking up the guards and it's kind of

26
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,220
interesting as I see people trickling in

27
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,560
it really reminds me of security I've

28
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,479
been doing security for about 25 years

29
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,630
networking for 30 and you know people

30
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,290
have slowly slowly trickled in and under

31
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,759
understood how important security is

32
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,890
right and I think in the last five years

33
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,320
it's gotten a lot of global attention

34
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,640
because things are just so bad so my

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,820
talk really is about looking at the

36
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,670
fundamentals that really we should never

37
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,579
lose sight of and that deals with also

38
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,250
protocols but because the criminals and

39
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,979
the nefarious actors are getting smarter

40
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,170
and smarter in terms of how these

41
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,600
protocols work together to stay under

42
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,100
the radar so in the beginning right

43
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,580
thirty years ago Trust was inherent and

44
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,530
as I gave my talk in Estonia

45
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,720
I had looked through my archives and I

46
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,470
had done a small part when Estonia was

47
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,090
first getting connected to the Internet

48
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,760
and I have email archives of that and I

49
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,470
was looking through the old emails I

50
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,720
mean I think one person here is Estonian

51
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,330
who can read this but basically what

52
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,239
this email has said was you know because

53
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:34,480
I was helping them said you know here's

54
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,760
a couple of addresses where you can log

55
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,489
into the devices because at times I was

56
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:41,350
asked to log in to check whether or not

57
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,080
they configured things correctly and so

58
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,239
it's interesting right this is an email

59
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,310
like here's username here's password

60
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,830
it's guest but oh if you can't use this

61
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,930
then here's other credentials that you

62
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,140
can use to get into the system now this

63
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,300
isn't just in Estonia right this was

64
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,830
1992 1993 I was also on the inner up NOC

65
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,069
team in 1991-92 and I had met some

66
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:07,870
people and I was working for the

67
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,269
National Institute of Health where I got

68
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:11,860
a phone call one day and they're like oh

69
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,410
your Medicare care you got FTDI working

70
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,239
on Cisco routers so I'm like why yes I

71
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,040
did because well we've ended to this

72
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,840
problem would you mind logging into our

73
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,000
routers so he gave me the enable

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,860
password I logged in and I said oh yeah

75
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,840
you gotta upgrade to this micro code and

76
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,970
then I'm like well what did I login to

77
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,010
this is 1992 the Apple backbone router

78
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,480
okay it was fat I was like that's kind

79
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,280
of cool all right in two years later I

80
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,049
met the guy who actually hadn't had

81
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:40,720
phoned me but I mean the the point that

82
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,790
I'm trying to make right when we were

83
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,000
first starting to do connectivity it was

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,250
the focus was on getting connectivity to

85
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,650
work right and when people say nobody

86
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,620
thought about security that's a fallacy

87
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,790
because you already had username

88
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,340
password but you had some basic access

89
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,829
controls you didn't have all of the

90
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,870
nefarious activity I mean nobody would

91
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,109
have ever thought how much crime and and

92
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:07,989
other nefarious activity is going on so

93
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:10,480
privacy and online safety wasn't yet a

94
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,549
big concern but you know there was a

95
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:15,940
little bit of thought there now roll

96
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,478
into today and we have a lot of blind

97
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:23,229
trust issues by protocol standards well

98
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,610
it's a protocol it sustained

99
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,710
right I mean it's gotta work correctly

100
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,780
right but nobody takes into

101
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,659
consideration is well what is the must

102
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:35,620
shoulds and maze right how how secure

103
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,150
they if you have a must use you know

104
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,960
encryption algorithm that maybe has you

105
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,819
know only forty bit ciphers i'm making

106
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:46,599
this up right now

107
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:48,759
right but you know like paul it's a

108
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,189
standard so it's fine and as an

109
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:52,419
implementer you're like well the

110
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:54,099
standard says i can't implement it's

111
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:56,830
okay i'm gonna do it and then when you

112
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,479
think about implementation guidelines

113
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,360
right i was asked the other day well how

114
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,680
do we how do you deal with best

115
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,569
practices and i just kind of started

116
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:06,699
laughing i'm like that's a really good

117
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,530
question because there's so many to

118
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,009
choose from right there are and you know

119
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:14,469
what do we do with best practices that

120
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:16,810
are online that are dated right and

121
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,509
somebody knew like i I get very annoyed

122
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:21,969
when experts okay

123
00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:25,870
experts tell newer newer folks that oh

124
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,879
well it's all online just look at the

125
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:30,789
best practice right because I remember

126
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,710
in the days a couple of years ago when

127
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,289
you had a large issue with amplification

128
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:38,409
attacks and open recursive DNS servers I

129
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:40,330
mean you're looking at the best practice

130
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,610
documents for setting up and open

131
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,460
recursive resolver a lot of them are

132
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,039
recursive resolver a lot of them have

133
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:50,500
have it in a mode where you know to set

134
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,240
it up to being open recursive resolver

135
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,370
right how do you get rid of that online

136
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,370
I mean it's okay to have managed open

137
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,069
recursive resolvers but not unmanaged

138
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:02,020
once so that there's a lot of

139
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,509
implementation guidelines are they

140
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:07,599
really good practices or not but we

141
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:11,289
trust them device certifications right

142
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:13,330
this is also interesting because who

143
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,400
actually created their criteria for

144
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,800
device certifications and who's actually

145
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,190
doing the sanity checking of that

146
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,860
compliance mandates I have a love-hate

147
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,900
relationship with compliance I mean I

148
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,990
see where they make sense because it

149
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,919
really gives people a guideline for what

150
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:35,500
do they need to pay attention to but

151
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,710
then for some folks you know it's

152
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,590
mark yep I'm compliant I'm good well we

153
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,270
still have so many breaches so I don't

154
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,610
think you're good

155
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,500
documented policies don't even get me

156
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,240
started into that one I've done so many

157
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,120
security assessments and I see policies

158
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,210
and this one always sticks up in my mind

159
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:59,610
I had a job quite a few years ago at a

160
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,440
large in a large environment and I was

161
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,860
asked to be part of the policy team so I

162
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,320
took a look at their standards and you

163
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,150
know I actually do read them and give

164
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,550
comments and there was one that I looked

165
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,960
at and I said wow this is really

166
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,880
interesting let me do some research

167
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,860
because it was a mobile environment so I

168
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,990
started looking at all of the mobile

169
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,199
standards because what the policy the

170
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,419
encryption policies that said that

171
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,880
everything every equipment in this

172
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,759
environment must support TLS with I mean

173
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,060
sorry

174
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,289
AES 256-bit encryption fight for TLS

175
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:40,770
that was in the companies mandate and

176
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,750
then when I looked at the actual mobile

177
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,710
environment

178
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:48,210
there was one must-have algorithm for

179
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:52,800
TLS which was aes-192 so I went into the

180
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,470
next meeting and I said you do realize

181
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,349
for all the equipment that's compliant

182
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:00,630
with the standard they're not compliant

183
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,880
with our internal policy and ever you

184
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,419
want Ren oh right and I mean I came into

185
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,099
a late in the game and there were

186
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:11,130
already 15 people that were supposedly

187
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,919
creating this policy so I you know I

188
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,930
always wonder like who's actually paying

189
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,419
attention to the policies do they even

190
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,430
know what they're creating right and

191
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,169
there's blind trust everywhere there and

192
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:25,919
then the human factor right I mean I do

193
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,259
believe that people inherently want to

194
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,830
do good but we're human so we do make

195
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,399
mistakes that's okay right I hate when

196
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,529
somebody gets vilified for a mistake if

197
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:40,500
they do it again or don't care fine

198
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,659
you know then that's a problem but

199
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,420
otherwise right you can do and try to do

200
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,100
everything right but quite frankly

201
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,560
you'll still screw up somewhere right

202
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,330
that's just life

203
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,930
and a much bigger issue is

204
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,270
organizational silos and I mean

205
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,520
everybody loves to make fun of different

206
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,140
teams like they don't get it

207
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,790
well of course they don't get it they're

208
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,370
not in your field right and where we are

209
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,420
today with security we have to have

210
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,130
cross-functional understanding by the

211
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,220
executive teams have to understand not

212
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,430
the nerdy details but absolutely the

213
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,160
risks right in terms of what gets

214
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,440
introduced if they make certain business

215
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,020
decisions now they're the ones that are

216
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,170
liable right and so I'm okay if my

217
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,330
recommendations of Amma see so I make a

218
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,330
recommendation and they decide for

219
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,820
whatever reason that ok we'll accept

220
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,640
this risk right because they're liable

221
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,540
especially if there are trustees of a

222
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,060
company right but you know I'd like to

223
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,890
think that they're making at least an

224
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,950
informed decision and then legal

225
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,140
departments right they have to

226
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,120
understand like what is actually

227
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,640
compliant I mean from the legal team

228
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,820
might their job in a company is to make

229
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,090
sure nobody goes to jail right and so

230
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,820
and we're still all learning all over

231
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,000
the place in the global environment what

232
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,160
a security mean what does privacy mean

233
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,780
there's still a lot of work to do

234
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,480
and then with technical teams right you

235
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,430
typically have research architecture

236
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,070
operations and this is what I'm going to

237
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,890
touch upon later we still have silos in

238
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,840
terms of that's a DNS team that's the

239
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,820
routing team that's the email team you

240
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,770
know these are the application people

241
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,150
and what-have-you and we need more

242
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,290
cross-functional understanding of what's

243
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:39,880
going on then government and policy is

244
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,400
becoming more and more important because

245
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,710
now you also have state actors getting

246
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,170
involved in nefarious online activities

247
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,750
right so I mean in the last five years

248
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,360
I'd say ten years right really the

249
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,820
government's moved from not a what if

250
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,100
statement but you know when will the

251
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,960
something happen and there has already

252
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,489
been

253
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:02,239
activities right that have been

254
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:05,209
attributed to specific state actors but

255
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:07,069
what do you do about it which is where

256
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:09,589
cyber norms come into play and I really

257
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:10,999
like the panel that there was this

258
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:12,439
morning because they kind of touched

259
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:13,939
upon some of the things that I'm going

260
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,259
to talk about this morning

261
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,929
and then there's law enforcement but

262
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:20,389
we're actually starting to put criminals

263
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:23,869
in jail right because cyber crime is

264
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:27,860
crime I and that's something also that

265
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,589
we always have to keep in mind that the

266
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,040
virtual world mimics the physical world

267
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,629
right and the physical world is not

268
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:37,699
perfect there's still a lot of issues

269
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:40,399
there and so sometimes in the virtual

270
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,920
world and with you know online security

271
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,589
I see people always vilifying folks for

272
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:48,759
not being perfect well nobody is perfect

273
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:53,089
and we absolutely need to have this

274
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:54,889
cross-functional education and

275
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:58,129
understanding I had a question a couple

276
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:00,230
of days ago when I was a TNC and they

277
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,149
said you know you talked about not

278
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:04,220
having backdoor encryption so how do we

279
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,519
get the government to understand this

280
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,549
and I said reach out to them right

281
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:12,290
because if you're waiting for somebody

282
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,569
to reach out to you that's not the

283
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:17,389
answer right it's also up to us to make

284
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:19,639
the first move to help educate somebody

285
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:23,329
that maybe is not as knowledgeable and I

286
00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:25,249
had this just as a reminder because I

287
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:27,649
want to talk about this it was very

288
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:30,499
fascinating to me when with the Snowden

289
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,899
revelations everybody started to be on

290
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:34,639
this bandwagon of let's encrypt

291
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,879
everything and I remember being at

292
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,529
different conferences and one time I

293
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:42,740
just had to stand up and say I'm not

294
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,169
against encryption right

295
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:47,600
I mean cryptography gets used for

296
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,410
integrity which means that you know if

297
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,929
I'm sending data to somebody that you

298
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:56,179
can be fairly certain that nobody's

299
00:12:56,179 --> 00:12:58,730
twiddled the bits in transit it's also

300
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,049
non-repudiation

301
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:01,850
that you can be fairly assured that it

302
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,549
came from me and then also the third

303
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:07,129
thing is confidentiality but everybody

304
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:10,250
started talking about confidentiality

305
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,250
then I started thinking about the fact

306
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,600
that you know cryptography has

307
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,440
consequences I mean how many of us have

308
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,790
created numerous PGP keys because one

309
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,920
that we created and haven't used we

310
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,110
forgot the secret pass phrase to get at

311
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,950
our secret keys right all of us have

312
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,470
done this especially if you've been

313
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,150
around for 25 years or 30 years and so

314
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,740
it's really interesting because when you

315
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,200
say encrypt everything I'm like well

316
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,680
have you really thought about the risks

317
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,230
of how you do credential management and

318
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,470
the fact that you can actually lose data

319
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,070
and lose access to it if something

320
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,130
happens where you lose how the

321
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,070
credential that gives you access to that

322
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,160
encrypted data right I've always been a

323
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,770
proponent for 20 years because this

324
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,810
started with my when I started working

325
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,420
with IPSec I care about using

326
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,060
cryptography for integrity I think every

327
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,970
single piece of data should be integrity

328
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:21,740
protected encryption not so much because

329
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,620
you're also losing visibility of certain

330
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,589
data so you have to think about what is

331
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:29,660
the impact of when you're actually using

332
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,510
encryption and we really have to think

333
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:37,240
through the consequences for the future

334
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,180
so another example of cross functional

335
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,260
brokenness right so a protocol developer

336
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,080
comes up with CSP a cool security

337
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,870
protocol all right and typically under

338
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,240
standards bodies right I mean they do

339
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,880
think about different use cases and a

340
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,770
lot of times there's a lot of different

341
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,110
options to handle every conceivable use

342
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,770
case the software implementer then looks

343
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,110
at the standard it says you know there's

344
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,020
some ambiguities but I will code CSP to

345
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,360
work this way and I'm gonna choose these

346
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,610
defaults hopefully some of these

347
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,250
developers will talk to each other by it

348
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,680
implemented and will actually choose the

349
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,220
same defaults not always the case the

350
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,600
security architect and

351
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,910
corporation says yep this is going to

352
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,639
save us and we have to use CSP so

353
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,910
absolutely let's implement that you have

354
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,790
the network operator for simplicity all

355
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,529
right you want to use defaults as much

356
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:38,690
as possible so that kept I'm gonna use

357
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,990
the defaults the executive right they

358
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,120
all care about being compliant hey we're

359
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,670
using CSP great more compliant because

360
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,319
that's what the compliant

361
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:50,899
compliance mandate says and then the

362
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:53,089
security researcher comes and says you

363
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:54,889
know this corporation is really stupid

364
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:57,139
because their use of CSP can be

365
00:15:57,139 --> 00:15:59,569
exploited and the one word that I will

366
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:02,810
say is heartbleed right because it was

367
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,600
fascinating I've done security workshops

368
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,310
for a very long time and I used to

369
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,769
always start with crypto 101 because I'd

370
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,540
say you know cryptography is important

371
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,149
you have to really pay attention or at

372
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:15,800
least be knowledgeable that you know

373
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,750
random number generators may not be the

374
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,850
best right this means that you could

375
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,339
have compromises in what you inherently

376
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:24,440
believe to be trusted by your public

377
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,360
private keys or the fact that you know

378
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,310
what are the defaults right there were

379
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,250
some vendors that still had 768 bit keys

380
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,009
for their IPSec defaults for way too

381
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:40,610
many years right so the reason that I

382
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,889
loved heartbleed was because everybody

383
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:44,269
took a little snoozer while I was

384
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,370
talking about crypto nobody really paid

385
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,110
attention all of a sudden with

386
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,240
heartbleed people like wow I need to

387
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,639
understand what my defaults are well I

388
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,560
got to pay attention to like the

389
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,930
different modes in crypto and you know

390
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,380
what the key lengths should be now yes

391
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,839
it's a pain in the butt it's details

392
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,359
that maybe some of us really wish would

393
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,049
be better in defaults but they're not

394
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:10,459
right so we live in a world right now

395
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:12,770
where you do have to pay attention you

396
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,839
do need to know what your defaults are

397
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,650
on your equipment

398
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,260
you do have to understand some of the

399
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,159
ramifications and you know one of the

400
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:24,049
things that I really really want

401
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:26,869
everybody to be aware of is that all of

402
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,730
these folks need to talk to each other

403
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,669
right this is why you also in companies

404
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:33,920
and in different organ

405
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,340
even in governments you have

406
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,800
cross-functional security teams so that

407
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,720
everybody can understand each other's

408
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,490
viewpoint and then figure out how to

409
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,410
mitigate the risks in a better way and

410
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,700
you know we're in this world right now

411
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,360
where we have so much data when I was at

412
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,300
TNC it was so cool because these are

413
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,460
research networks and there was some

414
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,830
really interesting interesting research

415
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,670
going on in an article you know other in

416
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,400
healthcare regimes and whatever have you

417
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,060
to really make our world better it's a

418
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,580
lot of data but then you have to think

419
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,370
about where is that data going right and

420
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,340
how is it getting secured so while we

421
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,460
want all of these new applications that

422
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,980
you know track our health we can know

423
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,310
how many steps we take and you know

424
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,900
whatever else have you I mean there's an

425
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,540
app for almost everything but really we

426
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,190
have to figure out you know how do

427
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,410
people have access to this data right

428
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,800
who's authorized to have access is there

429
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,170
any kind of access control is there

430
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,030
integrity so that nobody can twiddle

431
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,790
with the data in some way and then

432
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,430
there's the confidence yeah ality aspect

433
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,920
and if I need to have access to the data

434
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,850
will I have access and that also has to

435
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,250
be balanced with privacy human rights

436
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,490
right in the UN quite a few years ago

437
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,190
but it was decreed that Internet access

438
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:07,670
is a basic human right then online

439
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,580
privacy as well as freedom of expression

440
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:14,330
and so it's a very very complex thing

441
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,980
that we're dealing with when we're

442
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,680
looking at online security right

443
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:23,390
security and privacy and then

444
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,360
everything's broken right how many of

445
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,620
you actually track reaches ID I mean

446
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,600
it's kind of scary every time I give a

447
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,540
talk I put on a slide like this on and

448
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,910
then I look at the latest breaches so

449
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,890
that I can put in some newer headlines

450
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,620
and then I just shake my head and I'm

451
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,660
like okay okay don't think about it it's

452
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,800
kind of like when I fly on an airplane

453
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,419
and I think about the comp

454
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,579
city of what goes into an airplane right

455
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:51,019
it's the same thing like I don't want to

456
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:52,339
think about it because then I'll go nuts

457
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:54,950
right but you know when I look online

458
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,589
and I look at how broken everything is

459
00:19:57,589 --> 00:19:59,749
and how many breaches in every single

460
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:04,879
sector right it's it's interesting right

461
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:07,969
because why is this happening all right

462
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:09,709
there's a lot of people that care

463
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,899
there's good protocols out there there's

464
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:14,749
good equipment out there like what is it

465
00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:17,989
and yes I know it only takes one right

466
00:20:17,989 --> 00:20:20,659
to actually do a breach but sometimes

467
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:22,299
they're not detected for three years

468
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:26,570
right and it's really it's it's an

469
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:27,969
epidemic

470
00:20:27,969 --> 00:20:30,979
right and and a lot of breaches are not

471
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,129
even even reported or they're not seeing

472
00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:37,909
in the news and so it's it's very very

473
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:40,999
very interesting times and why are

474
00:20:40,999 --> 00:20:43,549
things so broken like remember the

475
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:45,739
trickle effect right like as I see today

476
00:20:45,739 --> 00:20:47,959
two people coming into the room it's a

477
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:49,789
trickle effect of people saying oh yeah

478
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:51,409
I really do have to pay attention to

479
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:53,899
this thing called security but we've now

480
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:55,579
reached the point where there's billions

481
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:58,729
of new devices online right and as we're

482
00:20:58,729 --> 00:21:01,669
all aware is that you know some of them

483
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:03,289
don't even have the fundamental security

484
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:06,200
basics that you can configure they're

485
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,749
not even implemented and there's large

486
00:21:08,749 --> 00:21:10,729
amounts of bandwidth now available

487
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:13,999
globally right I look at India India is

488
00:21:13,999 --> 00:21:16,369
exploding in terms of getting online

489
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:18,709
because there was an effort you know it

490
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:21,379
took ten years but you know they they

491
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:23,599
built out the capacity and now they're

492
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,909
making it very inexpensive for a lot of

493
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,489
folks to get online that's billions of

494
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:31,129
people then the criminal sophistication

495
00:21:31,129 --> 00:21:33,379
and this is what I'm going to touch upon

496
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:36,829
much more on is the criminals are

497
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,899
getting network architecture clue right

498
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:41,899
it used to just be endpoint devices but

499
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:43,639
in the last few years they've gotten

500
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:46,570
much much smarter to actually utilize

501
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,549
networks to do much more sophisticated

502
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:52,519
attacks so it's much harder to detect

503
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,089
and it causes a lot more impact I

504
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:58,069
attended some really great talks

505
00:21:58,069 --> 00:22:01,360
yesterday right there's there was one on

506
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,730
tunneling I mean there is a much more

507
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,740
tunneling going on for nefarious

508
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,460
activity and also use of encryption and

509
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,960
of course social media has been

510
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,670
weaponized for quite a number of years

511
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,799
and the information that we put out

512
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,980
there sometimes fascinating to me and

513
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:24,059
then you have a lot more automation so

514
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:28,059
data sharing also has opportunities and

515
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:30,540
risks right the opportunities are vast

516
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,730
so social media greatly simplifies

517
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:37,620
sharing I was on a panel it was about

518
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,980
2005 about how social media is changing

519
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,220
the security of companies right because

520
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,140
you're working for a company and you

521
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,090
might be putting out on social media

522
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,190
that hey yeah really cool I'm going

523
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,230
through a conference and or a meeting in

524
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,480
London and some people that are watching

525
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,880
the industry might say oh they work for

526
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,770
so-and-so company I've heard rumors that

527
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,169
there may be an acquisition and you know

528
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:03,669
because of the data that you're putting

529
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:05,890
out there people can piece together that

530
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,200
oh yeah there's talks going on all right

531
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,000
so this has been going on for over 15

532
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,280
years

533
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,350
but the simplified sharing people just

534
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,970
love to put information out there

535
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,530
without any thought of the consequences

536
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:23,230
and digitalization also enables sharing

537
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,540
across many sectors right the banking

538
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,580
sector the healthcare sector oil and

539
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,700
energy travel sector what-have-you and a

540
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,380
lot of times it gives you time and cost

541
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,880
savings and of course instant

542
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,669
gratification right I love looking at my

543
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:38,710
app and going wait what time do I fly

544
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,169
again oh where are my bags right some of

545
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,549
these airplane bags that so I know that

546
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:44,260
oh yeah my bag made it on the airplane

547
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,240
so when I arrive I'll have it yeah I'm

548
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,750
happy I mean but with all of this theta

549
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,700
what is what are all the risks that are

550
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,400
introduced and I think with gdpr I have

551
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,530
a love-hate relationship with it but

552
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,690
what I really love about it is people

553
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,390
have to start thinking about what data

554
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,570
do we have and how do we protect it and

555
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,970
a lot of people found out that wow we're

556
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,559
not really protecting it as well as we

557
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,000
should so who has the data where is the

558
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,370
data going what is done to

559
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,770
protect the data and how is the data

560
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,870
getting abused or what is the potential

561
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:25,450
for abuse so I do want to spend quite a

562
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,430
bit of time talking about the

563
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:30,040
fundamental building blocks where we

564
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,309
really need to think about how can we

565
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:35,110
better protect ourselves and have better

566
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:39,390
visibility before more damage is done in

567
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:42,130
surrouding the domain name system the

568
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,230
public key infrastructure right these

569
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,540
are fundamental building blocks where

570
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,429
we've have blind trust for a very long

571
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:49,030
time

572
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,850
also credential management right you

573
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,340
create a key or you create a password a

574
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,980
private public key pair do you really

575
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,990
think about the entire credential

576
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,210
lifecycle management right in many

577
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:04,510
environments people don't and then also

578
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,640
think about what the humans are doing

579
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,550
and for me there's I always think about

580
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,250
a couple of things for any security

581
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,679
assessment I do anything I look at any

582
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,650
new protocol I'm thinking of well how do

583
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,440
you establish identity because it has to

584
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,380
be hard to impersonate and also how has

585
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,170
identity actually validated right in any

586
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:30,010
kind of scenario and then do you have

587
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,679
integrity of data and confidentiality of

588
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:35,380
data like is that capability possible do

589
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,110
you need to do it and then a very

590
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:41,380
important component is auditing right

591
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,110
who has seen the information and looking

592
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:48,580
at early warnings right so in DNS in the

593
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,710
last few years people have understood

594
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,740
that if they start getting feeds for

595
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,350
newly observed domains right and then

596
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,110
see whether or not their their

597
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,540
reputation is good or bad they can

598
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,520
actually have some early warnings in

599
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,290
terms of some potential malicious

600
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:08,710
activity right so there are capabilities

601
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,500
around it's just are we utilizing them

602
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,780
effectively so this is where I get into

603
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,700
some of the sophisticated infrastructure

604
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,270
attacks so this happened back in April

605
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,880
2018 and it was really interesting to me

606
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,760
because it showed that by doing

607
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,950
a routing hijack that somebody was

608
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,010
actually able to poison the DNS cache

609
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,830
and they were putting together how

610
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:43,430
routing and DNS was working and there's

611
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,650
other such attacks also this was just

612
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,840
the most publicized attacked which

613
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,560
happened to take over if the Aryan

614
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,290
crypto current what's so basically

615
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:57,230
Amazon route prefixes were hijacked so

616
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,920
Amazon's route 53 DNS traffic for the

617
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,290
authoritative nameservers were rerouted

618
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:06,530
towards a malicious DNS server so the

619
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,750
malicious DNS authoritative server that

620
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,660
was set up had a legitimate IP address

621
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,330
due to the route hijack right so if you

622
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,040
were looking to see whether or not your

623
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,480
authoritative nameserver

624
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,210
had changed IP addresses right you

625
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,950
couldn't tell right you're staying under

626
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,130
the radar and then these malicious DNS

627
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:29,120
authoritative servers sent DNS answers

628
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,760
back that basically caused the cache

629
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,160
poisoning because they pointed to

630
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,040
malicious sites and then the intent

631
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,680
overall was to take over a theorem

632
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,930
cryptocurrency wallets so I have a

633
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,700
picture of this because sometimes a

634
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,150
picture is much better so the router on

635
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:54,500
the left is the the correct let's say

636
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,740
Amazon one where it announces a bunch of

637
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,900
slashed 23s

638
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,210
right and then most routers and this is

639
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,950
the point I want to make don't do

640
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:07,250
filtering effectively okay filtering has

641
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,770
been around for ever since the router

642
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:12,500
was created right and there's been talks

643
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,920
for 20 years about please do prefix

644
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,430
filtering or AES filtering and people

645
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,380
still don't do that as much as they

646
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,710
should so what happens is that somebody

647
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,990
that about on the left will hijack the

648
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,090
route they will send a more specific

649
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:32,840
slash 24 if you're not doing the correct

650
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,700
filtering you will just pass it on and

651
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,900
then everybody will utilize the traffic

652
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,830
and redirects it to the

653
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,950
router that hijacked the route now some

654
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,680
security folks have talked about well

655
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,480
what are you just since last 24 is

656
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,190
everywhere alright cuz imma solve the

657
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,710
problem and the routing people are like

658
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:55,590
are you nuts right because you don't

659
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,140
understand how a router works right and

660
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,210
you're gonna explode the router I mean

661
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,770
because it doesn't have enough memory

662
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:05,520
and then start thinking about ipv6 what

663
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,500
are you gonna do have slash 64's

664
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,020
everywhere all right I mean that's not a

665
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,670
solution right so filtering will help so

666
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,200
we all have to work with each other

667
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,060
right I mean the hierarchy and routing

668
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,690
was created for a reason and so rather

669
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,760
than say well it's your problem or it's

670
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,890
your problem or it's your problem it's

671
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,310
all of our problem right so doing some

672
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:32,130
prefix filtering will really help and

673
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,410
people really should pay attention to

674
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:38,490
this so you know what happens now you've

675
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:41,370
got this route hijack so then somebody

676
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,560
will set up the malicious authoritative

677
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,930
DNS server right with the right IP

678
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:49,250
address they will poison the recursive

679
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:52,410
server to send to point to a malicious

680
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:55,410
site and then the victim client you know

681
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,360
when they ask the question hey how do I

682
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,410
get to the etherium site then the

683
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:03,480
recursive DNS server will have the

684
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,240
malicious site in its cache and say hey

685
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,100
you know point to point to this

686
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,940
malicious site and I saw it wasn't

687
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,870
widely advertised or talked about in the

688
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,210
news but there was it happen in a

689
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,120
banking environment also alright so this

690
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,100
is not the only use case this is just

691
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,890
the one that was most widely you know in

692
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,230
the press but this is happening today

693
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:32,550
and so the criminals are becoming very

694
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:36,030
very sophisticated in terms of how to

695
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,770
stay under the radar right they've been

696
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:40,230
doing that for decades but we need to

697
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,270
understand that wow you know they're

698
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,670
really starting to understand network

699
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:47,550
infrastructure and figuring out how to

700
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:51,090
how to how to bypass even our current

701
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:53,099
alarm systems

702
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:56,709
so as I mentioned right the basic of our

703
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:58,629
hijack would not have been possible if

704
00:30:58,629 --> 00:31:00,459
there had been affected BGP prefix

705
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:03,849
filtering so most varmints do not filter

706
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:08,519
effectively and then there's also

707
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:11,019
something that people are now starting

708
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:13,899
to promote more and more and I do hope

709
00:31:13,899 --> 00:31:15,519
that people are paying attention to this

710
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,830
if you're a security person and don't

711
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,729
know about any routing security

712
00:31:20,729 --> 00:31:23,349
protocols please do you know look them

713
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:25,149
up and talk to the people in your

714
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,909
environments that are doing routing but

715
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:29,950
rpki the resource public key

716
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,509
infrastructure does help mitigate

717
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:34,659
routing hijacks as well and I have a

718
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,700
slide on that just to give a little bit

719
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,349
of fundamentals in case some of you

720
00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:40,899
don't know it and then also DNS SEC

721
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,479
right now the interesting thing about

722
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:47,229
rpki and DNS SEC is that they do rely on

723
00:31:47,229 --> 00:31:49,479
a public key infrastructure and so you

724
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:51,339
have to know that as well right so all

725
00:31:51,339 --> 00:31:53,440
these things tie together remember what

726
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,749
I said about technical silos right

727
00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:57,969
you're the security people so you know

728
00:31:57,969 --> 00:32:00,789
about certificates and rpki and you know

729
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:02,889
PKI infrastructure sorry PKI

730
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:04,899
infrastructures you're the routing

731
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:07,599
people right you're the DNS people right

732
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:09,909
even from a technical side we all have

733
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:11,349
to start communicating with each other

734
00:32:11,349 --> 00:32:14,619
because there's inter dependencies so

735
00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:16,899
when you're looking at what our PKI is

736
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:20,759
it provides for origin authentication so

737
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:24,700
basically if it says that I am

738
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,700
authorized with my ASN to route these

739
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,700
prefixes so I'm not going to go into too

740
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,799
much more detail because I've got a lot

741
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,899
more slides but basically that's the

742
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:39,249
premise and then also in the Internet

743
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:41,409
Society right because really people

744
00:32:41,409 --> 00:32:43,839
aren't doing the fundamentals to protect

745
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:46,269
the routing infrastructures they created

746
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:48,339
something called manners I know that

747
00:32:48,339 --> 00:32:50,049
myself and a few other people in this

748
00:32:50,049 --> 00:32:52,119
room were part of the early meetings on

749
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:55,419
that and so it's it's it's kind of a

750
00:32:55,419 --> 00:32:59,529
norm for Internet service providers by

751
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:03,039
to agree to

752
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,440
you know help each other and protect the

753
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,159
internet by by by paying attention to

754
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:12,100
routing security norms so one is to

755
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,559
prevent propagation of incorrect routing

756
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,690
information by doing BGP filtering

757
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:21,220
preventing traffic with spoofed source

758
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:25,509
addresses by utilizing pcp 38 which is

759
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:30,340
an IETF standard for ingress filtering

760
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,980
and using something called also unicast

761
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,049
reverse path forwarding and then

762
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:36,700
facilitating communication between

763
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,249
network operators which basically says

764
00:33:39,249 --> 00:33:40,840
yes I'm going to make sure that I have

765
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,879
contact information for my upstream and

766
00:33:42,879 --> 00:33:45,549
downstream and then also facilitating

767
00:33:45,549 --> 00:33:48,039
the validation of routing information by

768
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:49,119
using rpki

769
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:51,850
so the ISPs that have signed this

770
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:54,549
manifesto right are the ones that are

771
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:58,720
agreeing to actually implement these

772
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,460
four norms so it's a great great

773
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:07,239
initiative by Issac DNS right we've

774
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:10,299
heard over the last five years right a

775
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:13,809
lot of issue aliy ten years all of the

776
00:34:13,809 --> 00:34:16,719
the reasons why DNS is used for

777
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,960
nefarious activity so this slide I

778
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,540
actually asked permission two years ago

779
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,059
to use in another conference and I loved

780
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:27,668
the slide because it really helps to lay

781
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:30,309
out threats related to DNS and we

782
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:34,149
actually had a DNS sig meeting yesterday

783
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:36,579
but we're starting a DNS sig I'm one of

784
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:38,500
the co-chairs along with Carlos Alvarez

785
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,929
and there was a discussion about well

786
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:43,629
how do you categorize DNS abuse and I

787
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:46,449
didn't want to preempt this right but I

788
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:48,969
love this slide because it talks about

789
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:51,969
DNS protocol attacks DNS server attacks

790
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:55,629
and categorizes DNS abuse now it's not a

791
00:34:55,629 --> 00:34:58,089
standard anywhere but I would love to

792
00:34:58,089 --> 00:35:01,450
start proliferating this terminology so

793
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,670
with DNS protocol attacks you have the

794
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,799
man-in-the-middle attacks DNS spoofing

795
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:09,280
DNS rebinding DNS server attacks you

796
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,680
have server DDoS and daus's server

797
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,559
hijacks cache poisoning and then under

798
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:15,280
DNS

799
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,590
Buse you have a whole bunch of stuff

800
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:20,260
right which includes covert channels

801
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,830
malicious DNS tunneling malicious

802
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:27,850
domains and IPS and what have you but

803
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:30,250
it's it's a really compendium to shows

804
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:35,070
you to show you how much DNS is utilized

805
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:38,380
for nefarious activity and the folks

806
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,810
that came up with that are from Georgia

807
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:43,750
Tech led by um and it's there was a

808
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,510
paper that was written called detecting

809
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,700
intern abuse by analyzing passive DNS

810
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,020
traffic right but DNS is widely widely

811
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,170
abused and because of all the talks that

812
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,880
I saw yesterday and there's one today

813
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,890
also I think this community absolutely

814
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:03,700
is aware of all the DNS issues that we

815
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,580
have to pay attention to and of course

816
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,710
why do criminals register domain names

817
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,410
well because it's very easy to do

818
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,780
phishing and spam right well more

819
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,430
fishing right it's a phishing we care

820
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:18,040
about ransomware because these are the

821
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,920
the ways that people start or a criminal

822
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,620
start with getting access to information

823
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,330
where they can then do more

824
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:33,780
sophisticated attacks so basic hygiene

825
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,610
right it's all about the basic building

826
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:40,830
blocks now none of these things are new

827
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:43,750
but this leads up to something else

828
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,400
because there's more and more attacks

829
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,280
that are also starting to utilize more

830
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,900
sophistication within the DNS and these

831
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,200
are not new concepts these concepts all

832
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,290
deal with don't have faith sharing right

833
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,910
make sure that you have backups if

834
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,860
somebody's attacking this server make

835
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,960
sure that you have another server that

836
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,890
can then take over you know make sure

837
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,960
that you have access control because you

838
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,260
want to limit the views you want to

839
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,930
monitor activity to see whether or not

840
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,390
something changes but as I talked about

841
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,850
just earlier but even if you're

842
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,980
monitoring authoritative nameservers to

843
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,270
see whether or not there's a new IP

844
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,950
address because that might be somebody

845
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:27,759
trying to imperson

846
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:30,399
well if it's the same IP address and you

847
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:32,889
don't see a difference then what right

848
00:37:32,889 --> 00:37:34,839
so again there's never one silver bullet

849
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:41,639
my security has to be done in layers and

850
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:45,819
going on further but you want to do

851
00:37:45,819 --> 00:37:48,189
auditing you want to review the log

852
00:37:48,189 --> 00:37:50,380
files to make sure that nobody has

853
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:54,219
unauthorized access in an environment a

854
00:37:54,219 --> 00:37:56,469
few years ago when I was a C so we were

855
00:37:56,469 --> 00:37:58,149
starting to really look at you know

856
00:37:58,149 --> 00:38:00,639
which logs do we want to start paying a

857
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:03,099
lot of attention to I thought about it

858
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:05,229
for a while and I said my number one is

859
00:38:05,229 --> 00:38:08,619
unauthorized access attempts you know

860
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,749
that to me was primary I mean there's so

861
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:12,489
many things that I needed to look at and

862
00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:15,849
pay attention to but my primary one was

863
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:18,519
unauthorized access attempts because

864
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:20,559
this gives me a way to see who's

865
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:22,329
knocking on the door and who might be

866
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:25,089
getting in right I mean you guys might

867
00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:28,179
have some other perspectives but you

868
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:30,159
know to me that was really really

869
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:37,529
critical yes I wanted to make a point so

870
00:38:37,529 --> 00:38:40,869
the very last bullet I voted this way on

871
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:43,749
purpose because sometimes people use

872
00:38:43,749 --> 00:38:46,359
terms and if you're not familiar with

873
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:48,009
them and don't know what they're used

874
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:50,709
for then you know gets a little bit

875
00:38:50,709 --> 00:38:52,989
convoluted so this sentence use

876
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:55,179
techniques to assure authoritative

877
00:38:55,179 --> 00:38:57,459
answers come from expected source and

878
00:38:57,459 --> 00:38:59,349
that no one has been able to modify the

879
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:01,809
answer in transit I could have used one

880
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:06,309
word what would it have been DNS SEC

881
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:09,759
exactly so I always like to talk about

882
00:39:09,759 --> 00:39:12,999
what does it do because if you talk to

883
00:39:12,999 --> 00:39:15,009
the executives and say well we have to

884
00:39:15,009 --> 00:39:17,619
use DNS SEC they're like whoa whoa whoa

885
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:19,719
whoa whoa yeah right I mean what is that

886
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:23,259
it's like so yeah I mean I just want to

887
00:39:23,259 --> 00:39:24,849
let them know that look there's

888
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:27,309
techniques right well you know that the

889
00:39:27,309 --> 00:39:29,349
answer comes from the authoritative and

890
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:31,959
nobody's modified it or can't spoof or

891
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:35,649
cache that makes sense to them so that's

892
00:39:35,649 --> 00:39:38,849
not difficult right and so we have to

893
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:42,550
remember that we need to create context

894
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,380
around some of the technical stuff we

895
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:49,930
speak about all right so I'm not gonna

896
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,210
go into what the NSA is because I'm

897
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,590
looking at the timer here and there's

898
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,800
still a lot of points I want to make but

899
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,470
DNS SEC is important right and there's

900
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:02,920
another protocol Dane I which also

901
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,460
relies on DNS SEC and so DNS SEC relies

902
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:09,220
on you understanding public key

903
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,900
infrastructure right and doing

904
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,330
credential management so there's a lot

905
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:17,470
of interdependencies and it starts with

906
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:20,020
the building blocks DNS SEC is a very

907
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,390
very important building block for

908
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:26,770
securing DNS and you know what are the

909
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:30,070
criminals after all right they're after

910
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,530
information so that they can impersonate

911
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:36,340
you so they can create fraud right this

912
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,830
is why they're going after the medical

913
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:41,860
industry the the banking industry your

914
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,410
social media sites right there's so much

915
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:48,040
fishing going on last year I started

916
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:53,760
getting phishing from 3 supposed

917
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,830
individuals right that all looked to be

918
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:01,510
on the homeowners board that I'm on

919
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:03,520
well it wasn't from them right I looked

920
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,680
at the actual email address I'm like huh

921
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,410
some gobbly from you know whatever

922
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,510
country right whatever top-level domain

923
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,180
but what was really interesting is that

924
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,280
I've gotten in the last 4 months

925
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,770
probably 20 of those phishing attacks

926
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,410
all different right all with different

927
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:22,210
kind of links or documents that I'm

928
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,340
supposedly you know supposed to click on

929
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,520
way to infect my machine but the names

930
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,950
are the three other people that are on

931
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,410
the homeowners board and I'm like who

932
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,660
did this research and the other people

933
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,580
got it as well right and I told them

934
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,380
right away don't click on anything send

935
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,820
me the information because I'm

936
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,350
consolidating the information and

937
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,570
sending it to law enforcement because

938
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,220
they might be building a bigger case on

939
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,770
this but it's interesting to me because

940
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:49,870
they're targeting specific groups and

941
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,130
people are doing the research

942
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:53,140
right I mean homeowners association

943
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,730
board what

944
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:57,369
right and and really it's starting to

945
00:41:57,369 --> 00:41:58,900
get to the laymen and they're really

946
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,630
looking at groups of people right and

947
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,550
being very clever in terms of the emails

948
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,470
that they're creating but this is what

949
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:10,570
they're after and so the thing that I'm

950
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,780
I've been on the bandwagon for for 15

951
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,990
years is credential management right and

952
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:20,050
I'm on the security Advisory Council of

953
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:23,859
ICANN and we did a report about three

954
00:42:23,859 --> 00:42:26,680
years ago so now it was published sac 74

955
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,369
which talked about the life cycle of

956
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:34,300
credential management because nobody or

957
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,180
very few people I should say are doing

958
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:41,050
it effectively and this is one way that

959
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:44,440
many many many sophisticated attacks

960
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,660
start by getting access to credentials

961
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:50,320
and there's many ways that criminals get

962
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,089
access to credentials right being a

963
00:42:52,089 --> 00:42:54,280
victim of phishing attack attack a

964
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,890
laptop gets stolen and you haven't

965
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:58,690
encrypted your device and you've got a

966
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:01,000
file with credentials on there I use a

967
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,470
password manager if you can you always

968
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:08,290
should be able to sharing your password

969
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:10,150
with another person right it still

970
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:10,750
happens

971
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,940
all right I've been on elevators and

972
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,829
conferences in the back of me there's

973
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:17,140
you know two people talking that oh yeah

974
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,210
I need access to this oh you know I

975
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,460
don't know my password or you know

976
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,810
whatever the excuse and the guy's like

977
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:24,819
I'll just use mine you know username

978
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:26,380
password I mean I could very easily

979
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,990
glance at the person's like badge and be

980
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:30,970
like oh that company oh you know maybe

981
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:32,950
start some of the various activity to

982
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:35,020
see if I can log in somewhere right

983
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,839
airplanes people still talking airplanes

984
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,390
or on restaurants about things like this

985
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:43,329
and I've been a witness so sometimes

986
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,569
depending on my mood I'm like hello do

987
00:43:46,569 --> 00:43:48,040
you want me to log in maybe I'll look at

988
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,750
your a s number and your IP address or

989
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,130
something I'm like oh you're from

990
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:53,470
so-and-so company you know you probably

991
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:54,790
shouldn't be talking about what your

992
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:57,069
passwords are right or you should be

993
00:43:57,069 --> 00:43:59,950
doing two-factor authentication but

994
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:04,060
anyway so sending credentials and clear

995
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,700
text emails that still happens by the

996
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,130
and so sometimes there is a breach and

997
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:11,200
the very very helpful customer service

998
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,480
people you know want to renew the

999
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:15,610
credentials in a really speedy way and

1000
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:18,010
want to send them an email right they're

1001
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:20,830
not stupid they're just not experienced

1002
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:23,560
enough okay and this is where we have

1003
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,260
education to do and we at least have to

1004
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,150
have a process in whatever environment

1005
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:30,820
you're in so that they know and they

1006
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,940
learn not to do that and of course

1007
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,070
unpatched security vulnerabilities are

1008
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:38,200
exploited right again the panel

1009
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,450
yesterday was excellent because you

1010
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:42,640
really do have to do the updates and

1011
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,230
patches as quickly as feasible

1012
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:51,400
so this slide is a synopsis of good

1013
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,070
credential management practices so

1014
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:56,080
whenever you're creating changing

1015
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,750
renewing credentials you need to think

1016
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:01,480
about how are you distributing it ID ru

1017
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,640
integrity protecting it and keeping the

1018
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,830
credentials confidential if they need to

1019
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:08,650
be how are you storing it right is it

1020
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:10,480
integrity protected does it have

1021
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,220
confidentiality recovering delegating or

1022
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:19,960
transferring revoking destroying and a

1023
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,880
lot of times why these devices are

1024
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,940
awesome right but what people don't

1025
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,240
sometimes think about is that if they

1026
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,810
have credentials on here because they're

1027
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:34,540
logging into certain systems why do they

1028
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:37,750
automatically back these up to a cloud a

1029
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:41,560
cloud is somebody else's computer right

1030
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,570
somebody else who's running that

1031
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:45,580
computer what kind of security

1032
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,830
mechanisms do they have to protect your

1033
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:50,200
data I'm not saying don't do it I'm

1034
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,170
saying make sure that you understand how

1035
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:57,460
they protect that data I do so we have

1036
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:00,340
to understand exactly what's happening

1037
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:04,300
with our credentials and we want to

1038
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,190
avoid surprises so these are just a

1039
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:07,680
couple of things that I've come across

1040
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,730
where people are not paying attention

1041
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,860
configuration files that store passwords

1042
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,020
are shared secret and clear text right

1043
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:19,660
even in routers like here here's one

1044
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:20,380
exam

1045
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,420
I was in an environment I was doing a

1046
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:25,209
security assessment and I was looking at

1047
00:46:25,209 --> 00:46:27,729
I'm very familiar with Cisco Cisco

1048
00:46:27,729 --> 00:46:30,729
router configs and so I was saying you

1049
00:46:30,729 --> 00:46:33,219
know why why did you decide to do this

1050
00:46:33,219 --> 00:46:35,589
and they said oh well because some smart

1051
00:46:35,589 --> 00:46:37,660
person told us to and I'm like well

1052
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,910
that's more persons and so smart because

1053
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:42,339
for any of you that might know this

1054
00:46:42,339 --> 00:46:42,999
right

1055
00:46:42,999 --> 00:46:49,390
Cisco has this way of protecting secrets

1056
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:52,150
in their configuration files where you

1057
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:54,249
say username password something or

1058
00:46:54,249 --> 00:46:56,890
username secret something if you use the

1059
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:59,469
key word password when you encrypt that

1060
00:46:59,469 --> 00:47:02,140
using a password service encryption

1061
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:04,929
command it creates a bit shift if you

1062
00:47:04,929 --> 00:47:06,939
use username secret so the key word

1063
00:47:06,939 --> 00:47:10,869
secret it doesn't md5 hash right and so

1064
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,219
you could use one or the other

1065
00:47:12,219 --> 00:47:13,900
I wish they'd get rid of the username

1066
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,479
password because doing the bit shift is

1067
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:20,349
something that years ago was put out on

1068
00:47:20,349 --> 00:47:21,789
the web and the minute that they

1069
00:47:21,789 --> 00:47:23,559
announced the functionality it was

1070
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:25,829
reverse engineer and I think an hour

1071
00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:28,539
right and so you're not then and you're

1072
00:47:28,539 --> 00:47:30,789
enable password but you could say enable

1073
00:47:30,789 --> 00:47:33,369
password something or enable secret

1074
00:47:33,369 --> 00:47:36,329
something so if you're sending that

1075
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:38,439
configuration file was supposedly

1076
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,150
encrypted

1077
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:43,209
you know confidential information by

1078
00:47:43,209 --> 00:47:46,150
confidential credentials then somebody

1079
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:47,589
could reverse-engineer that really

1080
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:49,809
quickly so you need to think about these

1081
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:53,650
things all right

1082
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:58,539
validating identity so crucial right I

1083
00:47:58,539 --> 00:48:01,029
have made statements sometimes and

1084
00:48:01,029 --> 00:48:03,099
they're always taken out of context that

1085
00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:04,779
sometimes I don't care when somebody has

1086
00:48:04,779 --> 00:48:08,109
my password right but if I had to factor

1087
00:48:08,109 --> 00:48:11,410
authentication I have less of a risk of

1088
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:14,049
somebody trying to impersonate me

1089
00:48:14,049 --> 00:48:17,109
because I have that second factor so

1090
00:48:17,109 --> 00:48:19,809
even if they have my password they still

1091
00:48:19,809 --> 00:48:22,119
need another piece of information before

1092
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:24,670
they can actually impersonate me all

1093
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,229
right of course I care if somebody has

1094
00:48:26,229 --> 00:48:29,140
my password but my main point is that

1095
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,000
today in this day in

1096
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,370
because there aren't better mechanisms

1097
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:35,830
available we need to do multi-factor

1098
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:40,720
authentication absolutely so here's

1099
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,180
another case and you know this is still

1100
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,610
ongoing but this is what started

1101
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:48,640
happening last fall so an attacker

1102
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,310
gained access to a victim's registrar

1103
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:53,950
account I when you want a domain you go

1104
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:57,550
and go to a registrar to then say hey

1105
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:59,740
you know let me by Medicare com

1106
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:04,300
and this was done by compromised login

1107
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,570
credentials so the attacker then changed

1108
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,150
the DNS record right the a record change

1109
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,670
the IP address and the authoritative

1110
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:15,070
server and pointed them to the attacker

1111
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:18,220
servers and then once the DNS zone

1112
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,470
content was changed the attackers

1113
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:22,840
impersonated legitimate services hosted

1114
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,120
by the victim and it gets more

1115
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:25,750
interesting

1116
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,000
the attackers then executed a

1117
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,920
man-in-the-middle attack against users

1118
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,190
by generating fake X out five of five or

1119
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:35,560
nine certificates so now we've got

1120
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,970
impersonated certificates in play and

1121
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:41,560
certificates also is one of the main

1122
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:45,130
building blocks all right years ago I

1123
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:48,610
was involved in doing a security

1124
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,970
assessment of the 787 airplane ok this

1125
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:55,210
was back in 2007 and I was looking at

1126
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:58,180
their peak PKI architecture and you know

1127
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,590
looking at how they do cross

1128
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:01,900
certifications of airplanes and access

1129
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:05,950
to airplanes and what-have-you and I'd

1130
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:08,410
never really looked that deeply into PKI

1131
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:10,900
before and boy did I get scared because

1132
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,060
there was a vendor that had a whole

1133
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,460
bunch of trusted boots in there right

1134
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:18,070
and and I don't like to name and shame

1135
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:21,040
so I'm pretty careful about this but

1136
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,920
yeah so and so we decided that we don't

1137
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,810
need all those routes and we want to be

1138
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:27,850
more stringent so we took him out out

1139
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:30,940
well the really sophisticated vendor

1140
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,800
decided that we probably didn't know

1141
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,910
what we were doing that they were

1142
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:35,020
smarter than us and they just

1143
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,850
automatically be populated all the

1144
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:39,820
routes right and it was really difficult

1145
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:43,070
to go into the the bowels of

1146
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:44,990
the configurations to actually change

1147
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:48,050
this right so after a while you know

1148
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:49,760
they changed that it took about a year

1149
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,580
or two and then I started looking at the

1150
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,530
different implementations I'm like this

1151
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:56,360
is so broken it's not even funny

1152
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,820
people were not validating what you're

1153
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,170
supposed to be validating in a

1154
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:03,110
certificate alright so you're supposed

1155
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:06,290
to look at the validity and they weren't

1156
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:08,960
like you know they didn't even say that

1157
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,410
oh look you know it's a year later than

1158
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:14,240
the validity period but the certificate

1159
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,130
is still valid why is that because the

1160
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:19,580
software's not checking it right and it

1161
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,180
was awful

1162
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,370
I mean it was worse than awful I'm like

1163
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,320
what are you guys doing you know and you

1164
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,680
started having you know ssl/tls

1165
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,600
everybody was depending on this right on

1166
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,120
the certificates yet the software wasn't

1167
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,830
checking what it was supposed to be

1168
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:37,490
checking for and this is what twelve

1169
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:39,860
years ago and I already started thinking

1170
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:42,290
I'm like huh I can either be depressed

1171
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:43,940
every single day of my life where I can

1172
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:46,840
just slowly try and help and make change

1173
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:50,660
right and it's all about education so I

1174
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,310
see that I'm already in the red and I've

1175
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:53,720
got a couple more points that I

1176
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,400
definitely want to make so I'm not gonna

1177
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,190
go into detail but with certificates

1178
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:00,260
right again this is what you're supposed

1179
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,510
to be checking on the right you know any

1180
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:05,210
software I hope they do that right and

1181
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:06,470
so how do you validate

1182
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:08,450
I don't know right I mean who has time

1183
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:10,580
to validate everything but this is the

1184
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:14,930
responsibilities of the vendors so it's

1185
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:16,130
getting better over time

1186
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:19,040
but again you know you got to check your

1187
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,550
implementation at times and so

1188
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:24,920
fundamental security so why does

1189
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,490
fundamental security matter this is a

1190
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:31,280
slide that I took by Jeffrey's which is

1191
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,930
an identity theft Resource Center

1192
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:35,300
breaches are just increasing increasing

1193
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:38,750
increasing this is from 2005 to 2007

1194
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,780
teen and you know how they're increasing

1195
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,330
in businesses medical environment

1196
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:45,410
educational environment there's a lot of

1197
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:46,970
universities getting attacked other

1198
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:50,450
schools government's financials and the

1199
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:52,640
thing is as your privacy gets violated

1200
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,890
as people get access to your PII

1201
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:56,120
personally from

1202
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:59,210
but what what are criminals doing with

1203
00:52:59,210 --> 00:52:59,770
it

1204
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:02,480
extortion bullying embarrassment

1205
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,510
financial rule identity identity theft

1206
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:08,110
fraud and it does lead to loss of life

1207
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:11,030
right with bullying right I think we've

1208
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:13,220
all seen in the new suicides that that

1209
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:16,610
you know people have and you know with

1210
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,230
the healthcare industry being attacked

1211
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:21,320
right there is absolutely loss of life

1212
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,960
that comes into the equation so this is

1213
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,700
not just fun and games anymore right

1214
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,830
this is extremely serious which is also

1215
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:31,070
why governments are getting involved so

1216
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:33,470
we need to get back to the basics all

1217
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:36,380
right to me security is always about

1218
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,930
these points on the left and I don't

1219
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:43,550
care what term a vendor makes up I will

1220
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:45,980
go back to the basics you know any cute

1221
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:48,590
term any fun term right I said well what

1222
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:51,050
are you actually doing oh okay this

1223
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:52,100
deals with integrity

1224
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:55,790
okay this deals with access control and

1225
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:59,600
then the most basic security controls

1226
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,090
minimize the impact of sophisticated

1227
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:04,700
attacks security is difficult because

1228
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:08,060
it's very detail oriented right there's

1229
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:11,690
a lot to think about a lot to do but the

1230
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:14,450
sophistication comes in also because

1231
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:18,350
people are utilizing very simple ways to

1232
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:21,530
get access to credentials that then help

1233
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:24,320
create the more sophisticated attacks so

1234
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,780
don't rely on defaults limit fate

1235
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:29,870
sharing use cryptographically protected

1236
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:32,600
protocols right and check your hashes

1237
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,310
when you're actually downloading any

1238
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:36,860
software right I know that I also

1239
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,080
sometimes get lazy and I'm like oh yeah

1240
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,960
no you know I trust it and then I'm like

1241
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,420
oh no you know I really should check the

1242
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:46,460
hash it will take me you know 30 extra

1243
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:49,520
seconds maybe 60 right but we have to be

1244
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,710
vigilant and then get alerted for

1245
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:56,390
unauthorized changes and we have to

1246
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:59,150
continue building trust in people right

1247
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:01,400
we want to build a culture that builds

1248
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,040
and maintains trust I think most people

1249
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,770
are trustworthy as we saw in the keynote

1250
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,990
yesterday you don't know

1251
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:10,820
who's gonna have any kind of nefarious

1252
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:13,880
agenda but same is true in the physical

1253
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,130
world right a physical crime you're like

1254
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:17,990
wow I never thought that person would do

1255
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:20,150
that it's the same in the virtual world

1256
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,180
you want to create values that center

1257
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,910
around integrity and Trust develop

1258
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:28,130
cultures of commitment you guys are all

1259
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:31,369
committed you came here this morning

1260
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,440
I was joking early I said you know

1261
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,869
anybody that actually was at the social

1262
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:37,730
last night and didn't come this morning

1263
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:39,860
if they click on the video to see this

1264
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:42,950
talk I want to drink it because I didn't

1265
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,270
drink last night because I'm on stage

1266
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:47,690
this morning so you want to challenge a

1267
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:50,240
culture of blame the blame game has to

1268
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,610
go away right the hype it's their fault

1269
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:54,260
it's their fault they're dumb they're

1270
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,450
stupid right we're all on this game

1271
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:57,080
together

1272
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,600
let's educate each other learn from

1273
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,820
incidents and again educate each other

1274
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:05,270
and Trust is always earned but you have

1275
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:07,670
to verify right I might trust you today

1276
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:10,420
I may not trust you tomorrow

1277
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:14,270
so trust but verify and remember don't

1278
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:16,460
have blind trust and standards

1279
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:19,190
frameworks best practices reference

1280
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:22,700
implementation certifications I do look

1281
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,770
at them on occasion see whether or not

1282
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:27,770
they have to be changed and then somehow

1283
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:29,480
we have to measure effectiveness over

1284
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:34,000
time and that's it for today

1285
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,630
it's great thank you very much indeed

1286
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:45,810
America we've probably got time for one

1287
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:49,500
quick question because we are on short

1288
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:55,110
coffee breaks today okay I hope you're

1289
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:58,350
around today yeah I'll be around for a

1290
00:56:58,350 --> 00:56:59,010
couple hours

1291
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:03,120
oh sorry somebody in a dark shirt in the

1292
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:11,060
back of the auditorium yeah thank you

1293
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:17,610
my name is Seenu from Indonesia how do

1294
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:21,810
you think about cryptography in the

1295
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:28,200
future because everyone it speed and etc

1296
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:35,130
their data later cause according your

1297
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:38,970
presentation cryptography has limitation

1298
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:42,690
thank you yes thank you for that

1299
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:45,830
question so I want to reiterate

1300
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:49,350
cryptography is used for at least three

1301
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:50,000
things

1302
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,870
integrity non-repudiation and

1303
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,050
confidentiality

1304
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:58,860
I think cryptography is essential to

1305
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:02,100
secure communication what I think we

1306
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:05,640
have to think about is where we need to

1307
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:10,250
have confidentiality because in my mind

1308
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:13,380
integrity and non-repudiation and using

1309
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:16,530
cryptography is essential for all

1310
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:20,220
communications all pieces of data for

1311
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,680
confidentiality you want to make a

1312
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,230
policy decision because you want to see

1313
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:26,430
whether or not you need to have

1314
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:30,920
visibility to the data for other reasons

1315
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,420
right thank you

1316
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:37,170
one note we've spotted that there is a

1317
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:40,710
rather hideous clash between the women

1318
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:45,920
of first bath and the PC 2020 lunch and

1319
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,750
since we don't want an all-male program

1320
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,359
committee can you

1321
00:58:50,359 --> 00:58:53,059
no really really we don't want normal

1322
00:58:53,059 --> 00:58:56,509
program committee can you keep an eye on

1323
00:58:56,509 --> 00:58:59,059
the buff board downstairs because the

1324
00:58:59,059 --> 00:59:00,999
previously announced times may change

1325
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:03,979
the last I have from Nora is we're on it

1326
00:59:03,979 --> 00:59:07,429
so if you're coming so thank you very

1327
00:59:07,429 --> 00:59:08,010
much very good

1328
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:16,099
[Applause]
