1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,909
next keynote speaker as I said I've been

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:04,680
in picking of the keynotes I've been

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,690
looking for people from a little outside

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,769
our community looking in who I thought

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,099
would bring new insights on the topics

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,630
we should maybe be thinking more about

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,640
and one I'd identified was human factors

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,320
so I did a bit of searching around and I

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,689
discovered our next speaker who is

10
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,930
Professor Monica witty from the

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:42,450
University of Melbourne well thank you

12
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,440
very much for having me here yes I am I

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,550
have come all the way from the

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,829
University of Melbourne although I was

15
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,070
living in the UK for over 15 years so

16
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,829
it's a coming back home a little bit for

17
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,489
me in fact so the last University of us

18
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:01,680
that was the University of Warwick and I

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,690
worked on the cybersecurity center that

20
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,189
wmg and a lot of work we did actually

21
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:10,590
involved working with industry so

22
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,350
although I often more likely do academic

23
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,930
conferences I love talking to partners

24
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,400
that are actually doing the ground work

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,189
that's so important I'm in this area and

26
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,520
working together on this and the talk

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,650
that I'm going to give you is on

28
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,720
developing a conceptual model for

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,299
insider threat which is work and that

30
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,240
was sponsored by CP and I am here in the

31
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,750
UK and but before I do I wanted to talk

32
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,009
a little bit about my approach they gets

33
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,009
to cybersecurity especially being said

34
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,200
that the idea being on the peripheral of

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,899
what we do and just to give you a flavor

36
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:50,850
for how a psychologist might actually

37
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,340
approach this this is the University

38
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,770
that I'm at University of Melbourne most

39
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,570
things are pretty new in Australia this

40
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,600
is one of the older type of buildings

41
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,040
but it's still not that whole but in

42
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,140
Australia you know that's very old I

43
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,378
guess um something a bit older up here I

44
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:12,989
thought was reflecting on yesterday's

45
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:13,420
tour

46
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,430
that I went to which were fascinating

47
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,130
and really important um and also

48
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,620
thinking about what the last our keynote

49
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,200
speaker had to say about the castle in

50
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,180
the fortress and this idea for metaphor

51
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,310
and it made me rethink about some of the

52
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,140
things I wanted to mention to you guys

53
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,600
today and part of that is looking at

54
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,880
this idea of what how do social

55
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,090
scientists how do psychologists look at

56
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,120
these factors in cybersecurity and why

57
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,390
are people so important and and we could

58
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,870
use that the castle the fortress as as a

59
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,840
metaphor for the technology perhaps that

60
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,160
we have to protect us but we also have

61
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,980
castles to protect people and people are

62
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,319
inside and our enemies are outside and

63
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:02,650
so there's been a lot of rethinking

64
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,230
about cyber security over time and it

65
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,100
was really nice to see an old paper

66
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,019
being brought up by the and the keynote

67
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:15,360
last yesterday Angeles Asus work on the

68
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,730
user is not the enemy the idea that

69
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,530
people are not stupid they're not the

70
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,690
weakest link that technology often

71
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,579
doesn't think about individuals

72
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,769
now that paper was written some time ago

73
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:28,870
and I do believe in talking to a lot

74
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,209
people a lot of companies that the view

75
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:34,630
that view is is changing um but I still

76
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,190
think we have a long way to go in

77
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,470
thinking about rethinking about what do

78
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,510
we mean by cyber security and how do we

79
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,420
do that best so for instance yes of

80
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,920
course we need to look at the software

81
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,280
development and get that better but all

82
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,560
our spaces all our fortresses can be

83
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,690
broken into at some point there are weak

84
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,060
spots there and how do we deal with that

85
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,859
of course we deal better with our

86
00:03:56,859 --> 00:03:58,989
technology but we also need to think

87
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,000
about the people involved how do the

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,340
people involved help protect our

89
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,670
security as well and also what do we

90
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,010
know about our enemy and our enemy not

91
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,139
just in terms of that technology that's

92
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:14,350
breaking in to our the things that we

93
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,570
want to protect but who is that person

94
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,850
perhaps because a lot of the enemies are

95
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,680
real people that are using that

96
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,289
technology to actually infiltrate our

97
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:26,680
structures and so some of the work that

98
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,300
I do

99
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,000
is actually looking at who is the enemy

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,590
who are the enemies how do they work

101
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,289
together what kind of personality might

102
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:37,800
they have how do they behave not just in

103
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,750
sense of how they behave within that

104
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,940
using that technology and looking at

105
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,800
them online but how do they behave as

106
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,699
people as well and how do we strengthen

107
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:49,080
individuals to protect themselves as

108
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,659
well so sure the user is not the enemy

109
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:54,750
but also if we're going to help users

110
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,569
get be safer online and organizations

111
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:00,509
online we need to educate people and

112
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,490
part of the work that I do I'm

113
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,349
especially looking at cyber scams and

114
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:06,330
other types of areas it's actually

115
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,310
saying right well there's a lot of

116
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,669
awareness raising campaigns out there

117
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:13,259
saying everyone needs to know about

118
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,620
these security threats but unfortunately

119
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,569
just telling people that these threats

120
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,300
exist doesn't protect people so we need

121
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,979
to really rethink about how do we

122
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,469
actually ideally protect people so some

123
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:27,210
of the work I've been doing in more

124
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,979
recent times is looking at our

125
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,349
government webpages and how they try to

126
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:34,319
educate and change behavior and but we

127
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,449
need to look at this as a whole we need

128
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:38,969
to work on this together so some of the

129
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:40,800
work that I do is looking at cyber scams

130
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,990
had a week to tech criminals who are the

131
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,460
criminals how might we get them both

132
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,789
offline and online and how do we protect

133
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:50,990
users from these scams and how do we

134
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,150
combine the algorithms together with the

135
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,279
psychology to inform the algorithms to

136
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:59,180
better detect on our platforms as well

137
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,590
so the work here that I wanted to

138
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,779
present to you actually looks at insider

139
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:06,599
threat and this project worked with

140
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,940
computer scientists and in fact was led

141
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,460
by Professor say decrease at the

142
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,349
University of Oxford looking at the

143
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:15,629
computing science but the psychology

144
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:20,159
helped inform that an awful lot and so I

145
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,779
want to tell you a little bit about how

146
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:24,150
the psychology worked and at the end I'm

147
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,639
time permitting tell you how we combine

148
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,120
that psychology and the computing sites

149
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,729
together and also to mention we've

150
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:35,279
worked with numerous partners on this we

151
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,779
couldn't have done this without our

152
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:40,480
partners our stakeholders who

153
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,430
varying threats all the time and for us

154
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,830
to understand from their perspective

155
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,030
what were the threats who were the

156
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,880
threat actors and what is it that they

157
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,620
learn in hindsight from what happened

158
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,480
what do they think could improve it and

159
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,370
looking at our tools and how that might

160
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,220
actually improve it again and the

161
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,900
ultimate tool from this project was

162
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,600
actually developing automatic detection

163
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,150
in real time on people's systems and

164
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,800
which we got to test and in the real

165
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,230
world which was wonderful opportunity to

166
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:12,760
do ok so firstly before and saying

167
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,940
looking at insider threat we need to

168
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,950
understand what do we mean by an insider

169
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,710
threat and often this term is banded

170
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,690
towards both the malicious and the

171
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,390
accidental insider and both are worthy

172
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:28,900
of pursuit to understand and but in our

173
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,420
project we were more interested in the

174
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,970
malicious insider the sort of person

175
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,670
that goes in there on purpose to to

176
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,230
actually do something to that

177
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,680
organization and doing that something

178
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,690
that's harmful might be and there's a

179
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,430
lot of different types of insider

180
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,080
threats and I may not have even got them

181
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,530
all here are things like theft IP theft

182
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,700
fraud terrorism and reputational damage

183
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,350
blackmail denial of service attacks

184
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,480
introduction of viruses worms Trojan

185
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,470
horses etc corruption of or deletion of

186
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,200
data and altering data of password

187
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,580
cracking etc and the harms that might be

188
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,310
caused to an organization might be loss

189
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,130
of monies reputational harm harm to

190
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,010
employees come to the the organizational

191
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,630
structure as well which will come back

192
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,090
to harm to client security to

193
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:26,100
individuals and national infrastructure

194
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,350
now one of the things that people have

195
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,120
tried to do in the past is try to work

196
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,159
out who is the insider can we identify

197
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,740
who that insider is and that's what we

198
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,409
try to do here as well might we be able

199
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,240
to predict their behaviors might be able

200
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,200
to tell who they are and in actually in

201
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,380
actual fact in defining an insider even

202
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,030
when we say it's someone that causes

203
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,030
intentional harm that's not so easy to

204
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,940
do so there are some people

205
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,560
that might save people like Chelsea

206
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,080
Manning Julian Assange it would Snowden

207
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,080
for example are people who are insiders

208
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,650
they actually have caused a lot of harm

209
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,540
by their theft of data for instance and

210
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,150
other other actions how are there's

211
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,410
another side that will say they're

212
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,240
completely whistleblowers and of course

213
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,430
they Julian Assange issue has come up

214
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,750
again here in in the UK and that

215
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,220
question of you know is he a good guy is

216
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,130
a bad guy um and I'm not here to pass

217
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,920
judgment on that but to say even if we

218
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,750
went to go to define who is the

219
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,940
intentional malicious insider it's not

220
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,310
so easy to do so academics and

221
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,660
governments have done surveys and other

222
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,550
types of research to try and find out

223
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,460
who are these insiders just looking at

224
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,130
their demographics for example it's been

225
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,590
found that men twenty to forty five

226
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,960
years are more likely to be the insiders

227
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,180
and they're more likely to be full-time

228
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,660
permanent staff and customer-facing

229
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,640
financial security staff university

230
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,520
graduates their job roles might be

231
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,810
managerial but there might be non

232
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,290
managerial as well and the average

233
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,450
insider threatened with fraud according

234
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,270
to ciphers here in the UK as the average

235
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,660
worker is thirty years of age the age

236
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,010
range is 20 to 40 years the split is

237
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,770
60/40 which is taking into consideration

238
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,480
really the population of men to women

239
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,790
again we've looked at researchers Eric

240
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,460
Shaw he's a wonderful insider threat and

241
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,070
researcher has looked at this in terms

242
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,940
of IP theft and found similar types of

243
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,490
demographics statistics but I guess what

244
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,780
I want to say from all that it's

245
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,700
actually not taking note of what those

246
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,370
demographic details are but to say you

247
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,680
really can't identify an insider based

248
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,720
on demographics really not alone that's

249
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,910
really tough to do it's like a huge age

250
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,010
range could be men could be women could

251
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,260
be manager could not be how you're going

252
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,380
to find it from that can we find it from

253
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,020
dispositional indicators so some

254
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,580
researchers have looked at this what are

255
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,530
the personality types that might be

256
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,570
self-centered arrogant narcissistic

257
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,930
and they might be have self-deception

258
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:15,060
low self-esteem a moral a unethical

259
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,700
manipulative emotionally unstable but of

260
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,700
course some of these traits um happen

261
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,590
people who aren't insiders happen to

262
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,870
have these traits sometimes these people

263
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,940
turn out to be leaders sometimes they

264
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,500
lead you know countries for instance um

265
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,980
so it's it's very hard just to use these

266
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,690
dispositional traits to say is they are

267
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,560
they more likely to be an insider or not

268
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,990
um there are behavioral indicators as

269
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,700
well and some of those indicators and

270
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,700
measured by people and you guys doing

271
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,310
and companies that are actually looking

272
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,440
at these indicators and a lot of detail

273
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,560
things like volume of printing volume of

274
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,430
downloads there's also been work done in

275
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,560
hypothetical situations seeing language

276
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,660
change when somebody actually commits an

277
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,580
insider threat language change in their

278
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:10,030
emails they might have a poor emotional

279
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,070
state as well in terms of depressed or

280
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,200
stressed but of course not everyone

281
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,760
who's depressed not everyone who's

282
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,740
stressed because there's an attack on an

283
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,500
organization and I guess this leads to

284
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,600
our ethical issues that are involved in

285
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,880
insider threat and other issues as well

286
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,820
is that we really find it very hard to

287
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,520
pinpoint who might be an insider they

288
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,710
might just have psychological problems

289
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,480
that we want to actually help rather

290
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,610
than treat them as a potential threat to

291
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,160
an organization so how do we deal with

292
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,290
people that might fit this profile as

293
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,910
well I think it's something we have to

294
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,920
constantly think about before they've

295
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,420
even committed an act should be we

296
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,460
worried about them or should we actually

297
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,600
change the structures in our

298
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,340
organizations to help prevent these

299
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,530
things happening we'll look at that

300
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:57,370
again later in this particular study

301
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,740
which I looked at ninety nine case

302
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,720
studies and we didn't quite get to a

303
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,260
hundred for our deadline unfortunately

304
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,350
but close enough and we looked at first

305
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,240
thing what what are the types of

306
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,640
psychological characteristics that might

307
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,490
reveal who an insider is and also the

308
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,120
potential pathway to an attack um we

309
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,270
looked

310
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,580
we did this by interviewing a lot of

311
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,589
people that actually knew the person

312
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:28,779
that caused the attack it might have

313
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:30,279
been their managers it might have been

314
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,290
the security staff it might have been

315
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,570
their co-workers we interviewed a range

316
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,209
of people to gather up a profile about

317
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:39,730
that person and in most of those cases

318
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,190
before it was all revealed that that

319
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,430
person had caused an attack nobody

320
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,709
guessed that this person was going to do

321
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:50,380
something so in that hindsight they

322
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,940
would say oh I should have looked at

323
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,380
this I should have looked at that but

324
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,649
it's it's not so easy to pick up and the

325
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:58,360
organizations we can't reveal their

326
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,180
names but we had a lot in the financial

327
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,540
sector retail sector public sector high

328
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,410
school laborers a nursery warehouse in

329
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,209
prison as well so a range of different

330
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:16,330
organizations we also found a range of

331
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,910
different insider attacks as well so we

332
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,770
had fraud we had reputational damage

333
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,620
theft data theft identity theft money

334
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,190
laundering and the list goes on and that

335
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,510
was because that was our remit was

336
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,160
actually to look at as many different

337
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,380
types of insider threats as possible a

338
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,440
criticism of this might be to say well

339
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,959
actually we might need to break up the

340
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:39,370
different types of insider threats

341
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,540
because you might get a different type

342
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,500
of person more likely to do these anyway

343
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,959
um the in the inside of cases what it's

344
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,089
probably interesting to you especially

345
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,970
it's this first point that in most cases

346
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,750
it was an individual but actually in a

347
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,200
32%

348
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,149
they were working with a group of people

349
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:00,339
so in our heads we often think of the

350
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:02,920
insider as one person but it might be

351
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,020
someone that has actually worked in a

352
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,579
group together they may not have

353
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:09,160
actually joined that organization in the

354
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,740
first instance to Harman but they become

355
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,240
part of a group and they start

356
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,329
developing a plan and later on then they

357
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:18,040
might defraud a company or something

358
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,529
like that or they might be approached

359
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:22,750
from an outsider who's really more the

360
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,670
bad guy than they were and they were

361
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,950
influenced in particular ways they might

362
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,620
have been influenced romantically

363
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,520
developing a relationship with this

364
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,329
person not

365
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:32,679
realizing like that person's real

366
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,600
intentions where and then being

367
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,730
manipulated to go ahead and do the

368
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,639
attacks in that way the other criticism

369
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,259
about the research too that I'm sure

370
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:42,879
you're thinking about as you're looking

371
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,649
at this is that these are all the

372
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:46,809
insiders that we caught what about all

373
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:49,660
the guys and girls um who weren't caught

374
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,929
so it's very very very difficult to do

375
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:55,720
proper profiling on insiders because we

376
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,089
really don't have access to all the the

377
00:15:58,089 --> 00:15:59,529
threats all the people that have caused

378
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:03,459
these so briefly looking at the

379
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:05,829
description of the insider so I went

380
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:08,799
through and I interviewed them or all

381
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,220
these people about the 99 cases and um

382
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,529
we went through and said right what do

383
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:18,279
we know about the insider and we found

384
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:21,879
em some psychological variables for

385
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,589
instance we found and these are all

386
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:25,829
percentages that there were quite a few

387
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:28,779
extroverted people that were insiders

388
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,759
and quite a few narcissistic people as

389
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:33,579
well and but also we found a few

390
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:35,199
introverted people so if we gain a

391
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,910
really profound go well they're all more

392
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,709
likely to be extroverted

393
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:42,040
that's not really the case and we had a

394
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,429
few neurotic people and we had also some

395
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:47,799
people and with Asperger's as well and

396
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,600
that question with those sorts of

397
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,959
attacks they did so one instance but

398
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,079
this one was actually someone thought

399
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,629
that it would be a good idea to draw the

400
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:01,209
whole plan of a building that was a

401
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:03,100
security building because they were

402
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,019
clever in terms of putting it all

403
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:07,299
together and they put this publicly

404
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:09,579
available online now their intention

405
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:12,419
probably wasn't so malicious even though

406
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:15,459
others interpreted as malicious their

407
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:17,079
intention was probably to show how

408
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,630
clever they were to put it all together

409
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,579
but they did break security in order to

410
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,260
get their design out so they could see

411
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,929
the whole building and so you can see

412
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:27,760
we're dealing with different types of

413
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,730
people and some other types of insider

414
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,320
attacks where what in one case it was

415
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,870
looking at a bank there were three older

416
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,870
ladies that have been in that

417
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,610
organization for a very very long period

418
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:43,960
of time

419
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,019
and they play bingo together actually

420
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:49,779
and so they they thought wow this is fun

421
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:52,029
you know playing bingo together help out

422
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,519
we get a bit more money and defraud a

423
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:55,090
help bank

424
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:59,169
um but but at the time when it happen

425
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:00,879
they never enter that organization

426
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:04,210
thinking and how how they move to

427
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,909
progressing to that it's very difficult

428
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:09,369
to predict but nonetheless there's

429
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:11,049
another case and it's not the sort of

430
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,580
thing you think of instantly when you

431
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,039
think Insider of course we've had other

432
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,279
cases that were more your kind of ideal

433
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:21,070
type of insider he's been in an

434
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,679
organization caused IP theft or

435
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,049
defrauded that organization and because

436
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:28,600
of poor vetting procedures moved to

437
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,549
another organization and do the same

438
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:33,519
thing there and so the duration of when

439
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,440
the attack happens from when the person

440
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,999
begins and ends can be different

441
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:39,009
according to the different motivations

442
00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:42,879
for instance as well um so looking at

443
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:44,649
other indicators some were open to

444
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:47,230
flattery some were high on external

445
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,990
control some had a criminal record and

446
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,499
and and while we might say right well

447
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,690
why don't we all screen everyone for

448
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,440
criminal records not all jobs require

449
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,389
that not all jobs people want to think

450
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:02,799
they want to spend a lot of money doing

451
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,049
that betting but there's sometimes so

452
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:06,759
people like cleaners for instance that

453
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:08,740
might go in and in the cause an attack

454
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,600
or a labor that might come in that

455
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,090
actually our screening procedures miss

456
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,980
all that because we're not thinking that

457
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,509
might person be a threat to an

458
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:19,299
organization so perhaps we need to think

459
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:21,190
about our resources and how we do our

460
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,429
betting as well it's difficult difficult

461
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:28,749
to say where you want to put it all now

462
00:19:28,749 --> 00:19:30,970
one of the more interesting results here

463
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,210
was that actually we got a very split

464
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,330
result between having a strong work

465
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,950
affiliation and a weak work affiliation

466
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,600
so if we're looking for people who

467
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,879
aren't happy in an organization to be

468
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:45,340
more likely to be our insiders that

469
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,710
might be the case but we found slightly

470
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,480
more people who actually had a strong

471
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,649
work affiliation and so not so easy to

472
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:57,350
tell either em

473
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,180
we also looked at the idea being

474
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,920
stressed anxious and depressed and that

475
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,990
came high up there as as one of the

476
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,120
indicators but again as I said not all

477
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,520
people who are stressed want to cause

478
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,650
harm to what organizations or do harm

479
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,920
and we had a high proportion of addicted

480
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,140
people as well had they had a drug

481
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,940
addiction and alcohol addiction and

482
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,970
actually when I interviewed other people

483
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,900
who knew that particular person they all

484
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,360
knew they had an addiction problem they

485
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,340
just didn't associate that that might

486
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,650
cause harm to that organization or they

487
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,230
had conflict with HR saying you need to

488
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,270
treat them in a particular way and then

489
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,710
fall there was nothing they could do and

490
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,200
some were actually blackmail from others

491
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,390
outside the organization so I said about

492
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,890
32% of the the insiders worked with

493
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:53,000
others and so part of that was because

494
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,950
they were coerced by others in a

495
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,170
relationship or they've done something

496
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:01,220
not quite good in their other lives

497
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,140
outside of work it might have been an

498
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,240
assault or something like that and they

499
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,580
were going to be told in if they weren't

500
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,070
going to act on the behalf of the person

501
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,820
manipulating them so here are some of

502
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,980
the different stories that come to these

503
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,630
people who have caused these attacks

504
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:21,080
some had unusual hours and some download

505
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,150
at large amounts of data not a huge

506
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,610
amount

507
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,140
motivations for doing this some were

508
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,270
quite we might say quite greedy they

509
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,130
wanted that money and they were very

510
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,680
flamboyant about the money so people

511
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,120
could see that they were living beyond

512
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,270
their means and they needed to support

513
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,340
their addiction there was personal

514
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,720
hardship in their lives

515
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,940
I thought well though when you actually

516
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,520
look at this as we know in psychology

517
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,620
sometimes people use rationalizations

518
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,770
for their bad behaviors so personal

519
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,150
hardships not everyone personal

520
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,710
hardships goes and tries to rip off

521
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:58,400
their organization and so I I think we

522
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,350
have to be very careful with these types

523
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,870
of findings to think oh gosh you know

524
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:05,060
that person's just lost someone in their

525
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,910
lives better watch out for them such and

526
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,480
such as going out those

527
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,549
divorce very hard to balls that one

528
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:12,450
they're going to be quite broke

529
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,149
afterwards let's let's watch that one so

530
00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:17,490
so we just we just need to be careful

531
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,110
I'm not being very helpful I'm probably

532
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,360
asking more questions and actually

533
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,769
answering them but I think that's

534
00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:25,289
important to do as well to see what are

535
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:27,389
we actually finding do our stereotypes

536
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:30,600
pan out or do they not disgruntlement

537
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,870
and revenge came out a little bit

538
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,649
entitlement as well

539
00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:36,600
proof of cleverness especially with

540
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,350
fraud addiction to the crime itself that

541
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,549
some of them and when they were

542
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:43,919
interviewed afterwards by security said

543
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,899
why did you do this and you kept doing

544
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:47,730
this you kept a frauding the

545
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,429
organization they said I just wanted to

546
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:52,139
see how far I could go before you're

547
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:54,149
going to catch me and so they just

548
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:55,740
thought they're going to get me

549
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,289
eventually but maybe not so I can keep

550
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:01,409
trying and so and that's not uncommon

551
00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:04,889
without other types of crimes as well of

552
00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:07,230
course we've talked about this fortress

553
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,269
at the beginning with the castle on how

554
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:12,960
do we protect it and these insiders

555
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,649
looked for these weaknesses in security

556
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:18,179
but they weren't necessarily altogether

557
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:20,399
clever weaknesses in security it might

558
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,230
have been just stealing somebody's

559
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,830
password or actually having someone

560
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,630
trust them and giving them their

561
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,580
password because they thought they could

562
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,980
trust that individual and how do you go

563
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,230
with that what can you deal with that in

564
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,049
terms of technology or do we need to

565
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,580
deal with that in terms of actually

566
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,190
regulating behavior in the workplace to

567
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,529
make it acceptable practice to not be

568
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:45,630
embarrassed to act in particular way so

569
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,090
so what I mean by this is we tell

570
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,440
everyone all you mustn't give your

571
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,240
password out to everyone but he's your

572
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,740
colleague working here and they say I

573
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,690
need to get into this system can I

574
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,549
borrow your password for a minute to do

575
00:23:56,549 --> 00:23:59,100
that are you to not trust that that

576
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,899
colleague that's going to hurt your

577
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:03,960
workplace relationships right so instead

578
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,480
we need to actually think about how we

579
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,669
actually get people to behave in a

580
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:10,679
particular way and make it okay and make

581
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:13,500
it not look like mistrust one of the

582
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,659
issues that I looked at in this project

583
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:20,000
was actually not an issue necessarily of

584
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,529
getting into a system straight away but

585
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:23,280
rather tell

586
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,670
getting into a secure place and I talked

587
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,710
to people in organizations and I said

588
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,840
how do you feel about tailgating would

589
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,370
you let anyone in that you weren't sure

590
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:36,210
about and this is in the UK and people

591
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,760
felt very embarrassed by this idea of

592
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,860
actually questioning someone not

593
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,900
trusting someone to let them in and

594
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,940
actually the embarrassment of making a

595
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,280
mistake and calling someone out is not

596
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,950
going into that secure area was worse

597
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,050
for them in terms of then actually

598
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,970
getting it right and actually pulling

599
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,540
them out so and and even when myself

600
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,330
working in a security environment we

601
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,910
were reminded every week that we had to

602
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,520
act in this particular way so it's about

603
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,440
giving permission to act in a particular

604
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,200
way that breaks out our moral codes

605
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,450
really of how we behave so actually

606
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,100
thinking about security needs to be

607
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,230
thinking about some behaviors are

608
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,910
acceptable for these reasons and

609
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:20,070
changing the way we react in our

610
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,890
organisations but making that changing

611
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,780
that moral cone why we're doing that as

612
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:30,120
well okay so the discovery sometimes it

613
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,190
was discovered within the organisation a

614
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,690
lot of the times it was discovered

615
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,820
outside of the organisation and brought

616
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,210
to the attention of the organisation and

617
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,230
there are a lot of customer complaints

618
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,540
that brought this to the attention um

619
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,880
and so that's a bit of a worry despite

620
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,890
all the detection that was in these

621
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,900
organisations which some have very high

622
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,090
level detection they still weren't able

623
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,100
to notice it straightaway then they went

624
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,080
back to their detection and found it

625
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,770
there and found the proof um so I guess

626
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,270
what I'm saying is it's not so easy to

627
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,430
detect inside it so it's not so easy to

628
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,590
profile them and looking at all these

629
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,840
character traits actually it's not

630
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,230
simple but what I try to do from looking

631
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,940
at these character traits is put

632
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,950
together a few archetypes that may give

633
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,960
us some kind of meaning to these

634
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,580
different types of individuals that

635
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,360
cause harm to the organisation and these

636
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,060
are in order of what seemed to pan out

637
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,240
from the data so we found the addict was

638
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,610
actually the highest a one by far

639
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:32,010
in fact so the drug addict the gambling

640
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,380
addict and the alcohol addict and I

641
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,580
thought that was interesting because a

642
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,220
lot of the

643
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,990
so in insider threat if you're familiar

644
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,630
with it and talks about the disgruntled

645
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,400
employee that's the one we've got to

646
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,990
watch out for the one that feels that

647
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,850
they didn't get their promotion they

648
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,440
weren't happy about that they're going

649
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,070
to get you back but the disgruntled

650
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,740
employee was much further down actually

651
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,640
in terms of all this and so I think we

652
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,260
have to be careful about what we think

653
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,730
is the inside of the ad it was

654
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,309
definitely one and the ad it was kept in

655
00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:06,789
the organization and kept going outs you

656
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:08,320
know to feed their addictions off on

657
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,419
went going into work the full time that

658
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:12,250
they should be going into work that were

659
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,230
pulled in by their managers I spoke to

660
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,900
HR about these individuals and nobody

661
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,360
really did anything effective and it

662
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,429
could be that we don't actually label

663
00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:23,230
them as the bad guy that's going to do

664
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,179
the insider threat but actually we

665
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:27,039
develop programs to support the

666
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,260
addictive person but instead what seemed

667
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,700
to happen as they got shuffled around

668
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,159
here and there and the manager didn't

669
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:35,289
want them in their organization bit so

670
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:37,809
they move them somewhere else and until

671
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:39,460
eventually they needed their money in

672
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,110
there and they went for it so perhaps

673
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,900
developing some more behavioral programs

674
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,909
for these angel individuals might be a

675
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:48,309
good idea but definitely we need to do

676
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:50,559
something about people who clearly have

677
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,659
addictions in our organizations to do

678
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:55,750
something to support them but in the end

679
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,690
supports our organizations and some of

680
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,370
them were going through harder times but

681
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,590
as I say some people go through harder

682
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,929
times don't attack organizations but

683
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:05,980
again it might be something

684
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,230
organizations can do more in terms of

685
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:12,039
counseling supporting employees and you

686
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:14,440
know there's a lot of organizations

687
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,970
these days that want to do things to

688
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,480
support employees and so you know

689
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,500
universities that I've worked at they

690
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,260
want to do yoga and they want to do meat

691
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,030
meditation and all these other things

692
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,400
that we don't have any time to do to be

693
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,220
honest and so if we actually think about

694
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,929
how do we actually support the

695
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:33,580
individuals that need to that might be

696
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,110
where we need to be thinking about our

697
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,390
resources and some of them were just

698
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,940
pure greed and completely that was it

699
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,610
they just wanted more money or they

700
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,789
wanted to get IP and make more money out

701
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:47,620
of it somewhere else some of them was

702
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,290
showing off somewhere the disgruntled in

703
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,940
but you know some of them in terms of

704
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,220
the the pure greed and the show-off of

705
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,440
the harder times individuals started off

706
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,730
as star employees and changed over time

707
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,930
though the word the birds of the feather

708
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,700
so the bingo ladies I'll put them

709
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,380
together in that but there were others

710
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,200
that were more gang-related individuals

711
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,420
that might have shared a commonality in

712
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,240
that way there were career criminals and

713
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,560
there were the clever clogs that were

714
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,420
just trying to show off I guess in terms

715
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:20,080
of their cleverness um so what do we do

716
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,780
with all this well what I've tried to do

717
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,090
is actually put this together in terms

718
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,730
of a model and so right we know a little

719
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:30,040
bit about the people but we still need

720
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,870
to know more and we need to share this

721
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,180
information with each other when I talk

722
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,510
to organizations a lot of them had

723
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,190
security physical security here and

724
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,230
cyber security there and they never talk

725
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,630
to each other and of course we've talked

726
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,010
about the problems already in this

727
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,870
conference and other conferences of the

728
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,210
board and the makeup of the board I do

729
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:51,070
work for the World Economic Forum and

730
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,660
that's something we're really trying to

731
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,010
work on is you know those

732
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,690
decision-makers as well

733
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:58,510
but also we don't we still don't know

734
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,280
what we need to make decisions about

735
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,560
what data is important what data isn't

736
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,140
important how might we improve our

737
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,820
detection by looking at the people

738
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,180
themselves and how might that feed into

739
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,550
our our algorithms and back and forth

740
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,830
but also how might we develop programs

741
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,190
within an organization to look after

742
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,170
people who may cause an attack rather

743
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:23,220
than treat them as the enemy right and

744
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,260
some organizations have a high level of

745
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,270
threat a stress in their organization

746
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,360
which might lead to bigger problems the

747
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,550
other problem with all of this and I've

748
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:36,040
got this down the bottom is this idea of

749
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,940
ethics and social acceptability as well

750
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,450
the idea of putting detection in

751
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,010
organizations to detect if a threat has

752
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,660
happened a detective someone's done

753
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,870
something wrong may be very effective in

754
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:52,030
some levels but actually when you talk

755
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,460
to people about the idea of being

756
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,780
monitored and what they're being

757
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,150
monitored for not everyone really likes

758
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,640
an idea some people are very unhappy

759
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,990
about that idea

760
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,880
and then they feel that they don't have

761
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,760
trust for that organization so at the

762
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,679
time that we were doing this the banks

763
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:11,170
were getting us especially a bad rap and

764
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,990
maybe quite rightly I don't know and but

765
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,210
the way employees were seeing their

766
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,640
organizations where the guys at the top

767
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,559
are getting a lot of money we're getting

768
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,420
hardly anything so what does it matter

769
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,940
that we hurt that organization so the

770
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:29,650
idea of actually how we actually have

771
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,540
the organization is viewed by the

772
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:35,830
employees is also helpful I think and so

773
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,050
that's putting it all together but I

774
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,990
also wanted to briefly talk about how we

775
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:44,800
might as combine the psychology and the

776
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,700
computing science together and so what

777
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,880
we did in in this in this particular

778
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,980
project which lasted quite a few years

779
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,480
was we looked the computing science were

780
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,070
looking at all sorts of data that might

781
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,980
detect an insider and collected data

782
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,710
from organizations and ways that they'd

783
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:08,950
already done this before but what we did

784
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,990
as psychologists was actually runs some

785
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,570
studies to look at individuals over time

786
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:16,480
to see how they may change in their

787
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,020
behavior and also what we did was that

788
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,929
we looked at some variables that

789
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:25,240
actually might feed into the detection

790
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,050
itself so let me explain what we did was

791
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,700
a longer to denile study and in that

792
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,559
longer to dnal study we got people to

793
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:38,170
fill out some surveys we didn't get them

794
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,600
to fill out whether they'd actually done

795
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,970
an insider attack in an organization

796
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,500
people aren't going to respond to that

797
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,450
and they're not going to say yeah sure

798
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,270
Ida frauded my company or yeah I stole

799
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:52,059
IP but what we did instead was we looked

800
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:55,750
at our counterproductive behaviors in

801
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,750
the workplace and in looking at all that

802
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,309
some of those counterproductive

803
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:02,830
behaviors are more severe and more

804
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,950
likely to be insider threats then then

805
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,110
other types of behaviors and we did some

806
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,059
statistics around that and I've not

807
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:11,590
brought all the slides on that because

808
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:15,340
it's all very psychology and sciencing

809
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,840
you may not want to see all the

810
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,780
statistics on that um but in saying that

811
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,460
what we did was we looked at some of

812
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,260
these variables in terms of the

813
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,700
psychological variables that we

814
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,040
identified in these case studies and we

815
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,410
look to see are those people more likely

816
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:31,570
to be the people that do the

817
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,560
counterproductive behaviors are these

818
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,500
people more likely to do this over time

819
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,860
are there things over time that actually

820
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,710
might change someone to be more likely

821
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:47,650
to do an insider attack so we actually

822
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,260
measured these things over three points

823
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,200
in time so we looked at personality

824
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,080
traits like the dark triad and the dark

825
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,050
triad personality are types like

826
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:01,540
Machiavellian which is the charming

827
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,810
person that charms you over to be able

828
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:08,020
to be on their side and to do their

829
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,570
bidding basically and and these are

830
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,100
that's not necessarily a bad thing we

831
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,570
have some good leaders that can be

832
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,610
Machiavellian so it's not to say that

833
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:19,120
it's necessarily narcissism as well as

834
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,310
part of the dark triad so the idea that

835
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,889
someone and our statistic person is not

836
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:26,260
someone that just loves themselves and

837
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,210
tells everyone how fantastic they are

838
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,830
and how great they are and everything

839
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,840
they do is so great that's part of the

840
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,960
display of the behavior but also what we

841
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,000
find with narcissistic people is they've

842
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,480
got very fragile egos so what I mean by

843
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,310
that is that actually the reason why

844
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,469
they display all these behaviors saying

845
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:46,900
oh I'm so fantastic I'm so great on the

846
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,969
best that they've ever been and I know

847
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:51,070
I'm pretty sure this is reminding you of

848
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:55,179
some leader somewhere but he fits the

849
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:58,420
profile quite well and but underneath

850
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,970
all that there's a very fragile ego and

851
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,260
I'm not saying you have to feel sorry

852
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,770
for these people necessarily and I hope

853
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,920
I'm not offending anyone but but in that

854
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,260
sense they do this to protect their ego

855
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,410
and when they when their egos are harmed

856
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:17,710
they go and hurt so this is why we worry

857
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,780
about the narcissistic people it's about

858
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,880
what the narcissistic people keep them

859
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,150
sweet and then they'll keep being good

860
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:27,710
but if you hurt their egos they might

861
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,050
on you and they might get rid of

862
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,970
employees for instance it's what they do

863
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,040
they keep that this I know it sounds

864
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,369
funny but it's actually true

865
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:39,170
and so they keep the people that will

866
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,300
look after them and help their egos be

867
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,720
prompted up right so that's a

868
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,490
narcissistic person and then there's as

869
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,740
a person high on psychopathy as well

870
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,530
which are the people who show no remorse

871
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:54,230
if not no remorse for their actions they

872
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,060
actually can't perceive that anything

873
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,609
that they've done could have harmed or

874
00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:00,380
caused harm to people they don't reflect

875
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,390
on that they're not able to do that and

876
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,300
and and we find that you know you find

877
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,680
the combination of these three things

878
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,980
high on on criminal behavior anyway but

879
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,990
I do I do put a warning out there that

880
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,520
there are people that do have these

881
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,349
characteristics that aren't necessarily

882
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:18,470
the bad guys okay so we looked at these

883
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,720
people over time and we looked at a few

884
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,180
other characteristics like impulsivity

885
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,690
so quick to act because well that may

886
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,520
not necessarily be a malicious thing

887
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,950
being quick to act might put people in

888
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,290
trouble and so for instance when you're

889
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:36,880
looking at scams like phishing attacks

890
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,839
romance can that I've looked at other

891
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,240
types of scams you we find that people

892
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,520
who are more impulsive more likely to

893
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,140
click that button and download their

894
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,210
malware the people high on impulsivity

895
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:52,430
um we also looked at stress indicators

896
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:55,280
over time as well so we looked at things

897
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,540
like depression anxiety and stress and

898
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,880
we looked at those three and measured

899
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,740
those differently because in psychology

900
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,589
we define them slightly differently

901
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:08,720
people who are higher in anxiety it's

902
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,780
more of a more of a biological condition

903
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,640
that they find it very hard to regulate

904
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,359
and so they just they live on a higher

905
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,660
stream of worry and I guess and they

906
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,310
construe things a mortal worrying way

907
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:25,160
people high on stress it's often because

908
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,200
something's happened so they go high and

909
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,270
stress and then they might drop and

910
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,220
depression again is different while they

911
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,839
do overlap to some extent they are

912
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:35,330
slightly different and we thought that

913
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,099
was important because research on

914
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:39,020
insider threat has said all these three

915
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,520
things are important to look at with the

916
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,210
ins

917
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:42,980
but they hadn't measured these and in

918
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,540
psychology we like to measure these

919
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:49,340
different aspects concepts um so what we

920
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:52,280
found that over time people who were

921
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,220
high on narcissism were more likely to

922
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:58,670
do the kind of productive workplace

923
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:01,460
behaviors so but not so much on the

924
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,710
other levels a little bit on psychopathy

925
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,720
but then we don't find a lot of people

926
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,140
high on psychopathy anyway so maybe the

927
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,090
ones high on clinical psychopath eat

928
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:15,500
with worry about nonetheless and but one

929
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,450
of the more interesting results was that

930
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,580
when an attack was more likely to happen

931
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,130
it was more likely people who changed in

932
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,980
disposition to being more anxious so

933
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,570
they were going along in their jobs

934
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,900
doing fine and their their anxiety

935
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,090
levels shot up and it was at that time

936
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,740
that they were saying they were more

937
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,990
likely to do these behaviors so those

938
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,910
behaviors combined with the narcissistic

939
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,370
behaviors were the more things that we

940
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,230
need we needed to worry about at least

941
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,930
in that study but what's probably more

942
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:47,120
interesting to people here that are

943
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,820
doing more and technology research is we

944
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:52,190
also asked people questions regarding

945
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:55,580
how what types of online behaviors they

946
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,890
did know we know that we weren't picking

947
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,570
this up in real time and and they're

948
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,370
real behaviors I was asking them in

949
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:04,460
survey research and so we need to still

950
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,590
do the research to see what pans out in

951
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:09,650
reality but what we found is that the

952
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:12,140
insiders were more likely to do and then

953
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,290
well in narcissistic people were more

954
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:19,700
likely to do a lot more online activity

955
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,710
and they were more likely to do on

956
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:24,470
activity outside of work hours as well

957
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,720
and that was also the case with the

958
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,770
highly anxious people and so we found a

959
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:33,470
correlation between those activities a

960
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,600
high correlation but also we found a

961
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,460
high correlation with those activities

962
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,490
those people and the types of

963
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,140
counterproductive behaviors that we were

964
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,750
concerned about and so and those

965
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,640
behaviors might have being things like

966
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,100
being very angry at work harassing

967
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,250
others its minor threats and minor

968
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,110
thefts things like that

969
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:59,510
and so what we might be looking at then

970
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,030
in terms of our detection tools and we

971
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,260
looked at it a little bit in the

972
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,380
development of our own is learning more

973
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,450
about these links between what online

974
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,880
activities tell us and what it tells us

975
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,340
about that person of course we have to

976
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,840
be careful about our judgments because

977
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,520
we don't want to be then going gosh

978
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,050
everyone that's doing work outside of

979
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,120
ours we need to be worried about those

980
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,280
people because actually when we break it

981
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,840
down and look at some of these people we

982
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,850
find they had a deadline to work to it

983
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,230
was nothing to do with anything else

984
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:30,590
right so we need to to pan in and look

985
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,530
at that stuff but what it is saying is

986
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,420
that the sites might tell us when we

987
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,490
combine the psychology and we combine

988
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:40,760
the computing sites together more about

989
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,100
people do we want to do that do we not

990
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,360
want to do that well that's where the

991
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,040
ethics come in and the research that I

992
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,860
do a lot of involves philosophers saying

993
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,110
how far do we want to push things how

994
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,280
far do we want to know about our

995
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,050
detection do we want to know everything

996
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,430
about that person from their online

997
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,680
activities do we want to predict all

998
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,190
this I mean Cambridge analytical was an

999
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:04,010
example of going off outrage and and we

1000
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,600
may well be right to have at that

1001
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,570
outrage so I'm not saying here this is

1002
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:10,790
what we ought to be doing I'm saying

1003
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:13,070
this was what we can do and we could

1004
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:16,250
event society more should we want to but

1005
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,860
my how does that impact the way we trust

1006
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,620
people the way we work with people my

1007
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,540
gut feel is that we go back to that

1008
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:27,020
original clumsy model that I put

1009
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,480
together about saying we need to work

1010
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,510
together within organizations maybe that

1011
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,130
some data reveals some things about

1012
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,470
individuals but we might use that data

1013
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,870
in a different way not necessarily to

1014
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,180
look for the bad guy but actually look

1015
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,680
for the person that's in trouble and

1016
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,020
support that person we might want to

1017
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,880
consult our employees about how our data

1018
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,940
ought to be used so in some

1019
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,160
organizations I talked to they were very

1020
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,710
happy and for their data to be used in

1021
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:57,200
these ways but not surprising these were

1022
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,510
organizations where security was of

1023
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,160
utmost concern for them

1024
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,050
they were reminded of this constantly on

1025
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,030
the back of the toilet doors there were

1026
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,809
reminders of what they expect

1027
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:09,569
to do in terms of security these people

1028
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:11,759
were still not happy about engaging in

1029
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:14,069
calling out the tailgater by the way so

1030
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:15,719
even at that point they still didn't

1031
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:19,439
want to do that and so it is about the

1032
00:42:19,439 --> 00:42:21,419
organizational culture and what we might

1033
00:42:21,419 --> 00:42:23,729
do there but I think we need to be also

1034
00:42:23,729 --> 00:42:26,249
consulting our employees and how we

1035
00:42:26,249 --> 00:42:28,409
actually regulate that I know that's not

1036
00:42:28,409 --> 00:42:30,689
what everyone wants to do and people

1037
00:42:30,689 --> 00:42:32,400
want to be watching I mean picking it

1038
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,409
all out but there's that balance between

1039
00:42:34,409 --> 00:42:36,869
keeping a good healthy organization

1040
00:42:36,869 --> 00:42:39,929
versus picking out every single bad guy

1041
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:44,219
as well in all of that and I think this

1042
00:42:44,219 --> 00:42:46,229
is this is the main paper that I drew

1043
00:42:46,229 --> 00:42:48,150
from but there are many others you could

1044
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,219
you could read if you if you want to

1045
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:51,439
learn more about it

1046
00:42:51,439 --> 00:42:54,419
but I think I'm going to stop it there

1047
00:42:54,419 --> 00:42:56,759
and and draw upon any questions that you

1048
00:42:56,759 --> 00:42:59,119
might have about this so I can elucidate

1049
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,769
any any further issues that you might

1050
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:05,269
have it's okay

1051
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,160
thank you very much indeed and the the

1052
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,740
final comment about talk to people about

1053
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,820
how they want their data to be used

1054
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,990
anybody who was watching my Twitter

1055
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:30,030
stream earlier this week will realize

1056
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:32,310
why I suddenly sat very upright at that

1057
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:36,690
point I was being somewhat flamed for

1058
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:39,870
stuff I was not doing we have four

1059
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:44,460
microphones I think I think and I'm not

1060
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:49,160
surprised that Cato got to his first

1061
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:54,990
character k2 is great because normally

1062
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:59,940
the chair should have a question to

1063
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:03,030
cover the silent period if characters in

1064
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:08,960
the room don't worry I try Aaron first

1065
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,880
thanks first of all for the talk and

1066
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,880
secondly you're doing these surveys in

1067
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,890
gathering statistics and that's great I

1068
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:18,930
do some of that couldn't work myself so

1069
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:20,790
it's curious about dealing with the

1070
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,590
hindsight effect if you're going back to

1071
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:25,380
ask people after the incident they may

1072
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,210
remember things incorrectly because you

1073
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,830
know now they remember the incident so

1074
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:31,290
do you have any tricks for correcting

1075
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:33,630
for that or being careful about it yeah

1076
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,060
that's a good question I guess in terms

1077
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,670
of this research we had more

1078
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:39,720
triangulation because we were asking

1079
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,880
more than one person about that

1080
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,460
particular individual and but you're

1081
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,960
you're right hindsight's a wonderful

1082
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,510
thing and how you perceive that person

1083
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:51,150
afterwards and but that was one way to

1084
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:53,400
counteract some of that that bias I mean

1085
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,350
this by is going to be everywhere in our

1086
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:57,390
research and with insider threat it's

1087
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,490
just such a hard topic to really

1088
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:03,000
properly investigate but that was the

1089
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,380
best way that we could do it was

1090
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,870
actually look at that the other way was

1091
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,900
by doing that the survey research over

1092
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,450
time this was stuff that was people were

1093
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:15,450
revealing to us over a time period and

1094
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:17,670
rather than actually asking people to

1095
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:19,080
reflect back and see what they actually

1096
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:23,190
did yeah that makes sense sorry I've

1097
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,600
spotted that there was somebody up in

1098
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,839
the back

1099
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:29,350
thank you very very interesting top I

1100
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:32,420
wonder it maybe maybe I have a son bias

1101
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:36,470
because there there is a security

1102
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:40,610
measure that failed spectacularly in our

1103
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:44,770
country like the question what is your

1104
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:48,860
maiden name mother maiden name in our

1105
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:57,110
country wife never change her name but

1106
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:01,610
many organization our country adopt that

1107
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:05,770
kind of question so my asked to do their

1108
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:08,980
security measures but I wonder if

1109
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:15,470
culture culture aspect how do we how do

1110
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:24,380
we adopt something that might have

1111
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:30,070
cultural aspect in to be able to be

1112
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:34,040
applied to our our country I completely

1113
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,770
get your points and that cultural

1114
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:38,990
differences are so important beyond the

1115
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:41,090
organizational differences the cultural

1116
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:45,560
differences a critical right and we have

1117
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,210
to be critical of our research to say

1118
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:49,130
how far it can go in and it's important

1119
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:51,200
because we work you know companies work

1120
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,690
with other companies and so just even

1121
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,790
the detection is going to be different

1122
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:58,250
but also what is culturally acceptable

1123
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:01,250
can be very different as well so in the

1124
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:03,080
work that I do on cyber scans for

1125
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,720
instance in countries such as West

1126
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,110
Africa and fraud can be perceived as

1127
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:11,690
it's different in the sense that it's

1128
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:15,140
still perceived as a crime and but if

1129
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,240
you're clever enough to get away with it

1130
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,800
you'll kind of see them as well but it's

1131
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,890
not so bad and that's not necessarily by

1132
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:24,490
everyone because in those countries you

1133
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:28,010
know West Africans will defraud other

1134
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:29,750
West Africans it's not just about

1135
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:34,550
picking on Western countries and say so

1136
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,290
you're right I think the way we have to

1137
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:39,200
do this is is sure across cultures but

1138
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:39,859
it's also with

1139
00:47:39,859 --> 00:47:41,809
in organisations I don't think that we

1140
00:47:41,809 --> 00:47:43,819
can have this wonderful generalized

1141
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,499
model I think we have to work within

1142
00:47:45,499 --> 00:47:47,660
models within organizations themselves

1143
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:50,480
and how they work with other companies

1144
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,239
too so that's probably not giving you

1145
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:55,700
the answer exactly that you want but

1146
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,799
it's very very hard to generalize with

1147
00:47:57,799 --> 00:47:59,329
this and in another research we often

1148
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:01,220
have many more participants that we can

1149
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:03,200
actually build up our theories much

1150
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,539
better but if we're going to do this I

1151
00:48:05,539 --> 00:48:07,130
think we have to look at the type of

1152
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,900
insider threat that we're actually

1153
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,880
interested in so people like Eric Shaw

1154
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,589
at Carnegie Mellon's looking at IP theft

1155
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:14,869
I think that's a great idea to focus in

1156
00:48:14,869 --> 00:48:16,640
on that but then focus in on the

1157
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,559
organization's as well in that culture

1158
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,779
within there too and then whatever

1159
00:48:20,779 --> 00:48:22,249
cultures that we're looking at in

1160
00:48:22,249 --> 00:48:25,819
addition to thank you there's actually

1161
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:29,380
two layers because there are different

1162
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,950
national regional or geographical

1163
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:34,910
sensitivities but there are also

1164
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:36,470
different sensitivities in different

1165
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:38,630
types of organizations so your you know

1166
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:40,579
the organization with the security

1167
00:48:40,579 --> 00:48:41,720
instruction on the back of the toilet

1168
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,910
door is going to be quite different from

1169
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:47,480
a university or whatever yeah lots of

1170
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,989
challenges but I like the idea of

1171
00:48:49,989 --> 00:48:52,099
actually deal with the organizational

1172
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:55,039
culture and talk to people about how

1173
00:48:55,039 --> 00:49:05,059
they want Kurobe your national cyber

1174
00:49:05,059 --> 00:49:09,190
security center Finland in your study

1175
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:13,039
did you classify the insiders threat to

1176
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:17,509
be a person that is doing active

1177
00:49:17,509 --> 00:49:22,180
I mean conscious decisions to make make

1178
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:25,099
security trouble or you did you also

1179
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:28,279
count situation where a person's

1180
00:49:28,279 --> 00:49:32,779
behavior by his culture his hobbies his

1181
00:49:32,779 --> 00:49:36,220
or her hobbies or other is causing an

1182
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:39,259
inside threat or threat situation to an

1183
00:49:39,259 --> 00:49:44,420
organization and we looked at we focused

1184
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:45,710
on people who are doing that

1185
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:48,259
intentionally maliciously intentionally

1186
00:49:48,259 --> 00:49:50,839
to cause harm to the organization or to

1187
00:49:50,839 --> 00:49:52,579
benefit themselves I guess so if you're

1188
00:49:52,579 --> 00:49:53,180
looking at four

1189
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,730
for instance they weren't necessarily

1190
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:58,160
defrauding to go oh I really want to

1191
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,319
hurt you some people did it but they

1192
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,380
wanted to have gained from that but I

1193
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,089
think that the one that I mentioned with

1194
00:50:05,089 --> 00:50:07,369
the ass purchase was the one that was I

1195
00:50:07,369 --> 00:50:09,349
thought was on the periphery between

1196
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:11,569
really intending to hurt someone and

1197
00:50:11,569 --> 00:50:13,490
actually just doing a hobby really that

1198
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:15,410
was interesting and he would never be

1199
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:18,349
able to see given his in the way that he

1200
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:19,640
shouldn't say problems the way he

1201
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,010
pursued the world was different and that

1202
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,510
that made him very good at his job

1203
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:26,750
actually and so that was a that was a

1204
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,339
tricky one but in each of those cases

1205
00:50:28,339 --> 00:50:31,010
that we looked at pretty much they were

1206
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:33,980
all about not about a different cultural

1207
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,170
view but rather doing something that

1208
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,609
they knew was wrong I mean they were

1209
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:39,349
dismissed and and a lot of them were

1210
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:42,349
arrested and spent time in prison for

1211
00:50:42,349 --> 00:50:45,559
their actions so yeah um I have to say

1212
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:48,140
another insider threat that was very

1213
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:53,300
different add to when you're looking at

1214
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,550
IP theft and you're looking at someone's

1215
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,099
stealing our information we found one

1216
00:50:58,099 --> 00:51:00,170
that was the opposite way where an

1217
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:03,200
organization had and someone bring in

1218
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,720
the IP theft to their organization and

1219
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,940
they've had that that would have brought

1220
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,069
that organization which was a really big

1221
00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:12,829
on organization down because they'd

1222
00:51:12,829 --> 00:51:14,089
nicked something that they didn't know

1223
00:51:14,089 --> 00:51:16,940
that they'd stolen so it's sometimes it

1224
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:17,960
goes the other way that you don't

1225
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,460
realize but it was another case of

1226
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:23,440
intentional right from the previous

1227
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:29,869
thank you for your presentation and now

1228
00:51:29,869 --> 00:51:32,390
I was wondering if this type of

1229
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:35,240
personalities shouldn't be detected

1230
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,450
before during the hiring process when

1231
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:42,470
you're you have to do tests for people

1232
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:46,099
before entering a company and the second

1233
00:51:46,099 --> 00:51:48,710
question is if you have percentages of

1234
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:52,390
the of the attackers of the insiders

1235
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:55,369
yeah that's a very good question and

1236
00:51:55,369 --> 00:51:57,079
it's one that we thought a lot about

1237
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:00,349
might might feel this no and and the

1238
00:52:00,349 --> 00:52:02,390
reason why is because there's so much

1239
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:04,880
variation and we might you know go oh

1240
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,390
gosh we don't want nasty

1241
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:08,010
stick people hidden but narcissistic

1242
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:10,170
people we have have been all like you

1243
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,480
know walks of life and this is on a

1244
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,220
scale right anyway so it's people

1245
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:16,740
screwing a little bit higher and they

1246
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:19,079
they do very well in in particular jobs

1247
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:21,390
so if we are to prejudge a person before

1248
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:23,700
they become a criminal I think we're in

1249
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,819
very dangerous waters right so while I'm

1250
00:52:26,819 --> 00:52:28,230
saying these are the things that we

1251
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:30,299
found I'm not saying advocating that we

1252
00:52:30,299 --> 00:52:32,160
actually want to screen on that level

1253
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,319
and we want might want to screen on

1254
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,180
previous criminal history because that

1255
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,769
wasn't screen and I think that might be

1256
00:52:37,769 --> 00:52:42,180
quite reasonable to do you know but a

1257
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,099
lot of the stuff we know already in

1258
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:46,470
terms of how we interview people for

1259
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:48,779
jobs it's not really that good and

1260
00:52:48,779 --> 00:52:50,869
that's not about picking up the

1261
00:52:50,869 --> 00:52:53,940
problematic stuff but actually once it

1262
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,559
will fit in well with that job there's

1263
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:57,240
not a lot of validity just an interview

1264
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,339
we collect more information about people

1265
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:01,079
but do we want to look at their Facebook

1266
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:03,210
and their LinkedIn and make decisions

1267
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:05,880
about that what I feel is that that's a

1268
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,619
bit cringe-worthy for me I don't think

1269
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:09,779
we should be going down that path might

1270
00:53:09,779 --> 00:53:11,759
even though we found these things I'm

1271
00:53:11,759 --> 00:53:13,380
taking a step back and going actually

1272
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:15,660
why don't we help people that are in

1273
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,609
distress in our organizations because

1274
00:53:17,609 --> 00:53:19,049
then they won't go down that criminal

1275
00:53:19,049 --> 00:53:20,849
path we shouldn't assume because they've

1276
00:53:20,849 --> 00:53:22,500
got that makeup they're going to go that

1277
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,690
way maybe some of the stresses of work

1278
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:27,359
brought along also made a part of that

1279
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:29,609
contribution how do we make sure they go

1280
00:53:29,609 --> 00:53:32,849
down this way if that makes sense but

1281
00:53:32,849 --> 00:53:34,440
it's a good question it's something we

1282
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,579
think about right

1283
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:41,069
thank you thank you that idea that we

1284
00:53:41,069 --> 00:53:44,579
actually need to build organizations

1285
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:47,160
that are resilient to different types of

1286
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:51,750
people I think it goes back to the the

1287
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,369
castle and the fortress and you know

1288
00:53:53,369 --> 00:53:55,019
there army within there it's not just

1289
00:53:55,019 --> 00:53:56,880
the building that protects you right

1290
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,640
it's the way you're organized to build

1291
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:03,089
those attacks so yeah there will be a

1292
00:54:03,089 --> 00:54:04,890
blog post when I have a little bar thank

1293
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:06,769
you you've really thought provoking

1294
00:54:06,769 --> 00:54:08,910
right thank you very much

1295
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:15,099
[Applause]

1296
00:54:15,099 --> 00:54:18,740
okay i trolled something a little bit

1297
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:21,890
fun last year's conference it was

1298
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:24,380
pointed out to me that the core four

1299
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:27,589
papers are they meant to be hiding in

1300
00:54:27,589 --> 00:54:32,630
the doorway I I'm not going to keep

1301
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:35,960
talking all the time the the call for

1302
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,130
papers for this conference closed on the

1303
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:41,900
30th of November last year

1304
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,170
and that maybe some stuff was going to

1305
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:47,630
happen between the 30th of November and

1306
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:51,710
now in June so I was looking for some

1307
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:54,740
spaces in the program where we might be

1308
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:59,119
able to feed in some of those things

1309
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:02,650
that had happened Maurice
