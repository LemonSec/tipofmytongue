1
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:05,670
good morning

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,019
happy Friday well done to the survivors

3
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:11,700
this is a really good turnout thank you

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,259
have you had a good week

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,470
that's cheating pure self-gratification

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,070
it's been a lot of fun and my final bit

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,590
of fun for the week is to introduce I

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,110
think the person that I have heard speak

9
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,520
on the widest range of topics I've heard

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,100
Miranda talk about environmental history

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,860
I've heard a talk about deep legal

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,590
theory and this morning she's going to

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:51,239
talk about AI IOT and stuff dr. Miranda

14
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,680
Mowbray University of Bristol

15
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,440
hello everyone I'd like to start by

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,060
thanking the organizers firstly for

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,330
inviting me I am thrilled to be here and

18
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,360
secondly for all their hard work I'm

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,010
thrilled to be here because this is a

20
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,500
great community I've never been to this

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,330
conference before but to have this kind

22
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,060
of really open friendly atmosphere with

23
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,040
the conference this size means you're

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,480
doing something really great that not

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,960
many conferences managed to pull off I'm

26
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,600
also thrilled but I get to give the talk

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,180
about Internet of Things security called

28
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,830
things that go bump in the night I've

29
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,840
wanted to use this talk this title for

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,520
about two years and for two years when

31
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,820
everyone brings out a new paper about

32
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,920
Internet of Things security I look for

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,240
the title and go now they're going to

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,010
take the title I've got it

35
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,290
and this is conference in Scotland this

36
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,340
is a part of a Scottish prayer and I'll

37
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,460
give you the Scottish prayer so I claim

38
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,280
this title for mine it will be about

39
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,660
security for the Internet of Things

40
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,950
where the Internet of Things is anything

41
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,480
any physical object with embedded

42
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,970
computing and wireless connection so

43
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,680
very very general and I've had help from

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,489
my assistant

45
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:16,530
I mean Bala Lu who's the first-year

46
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,989
student I believe in mentoring so I got

47
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:20,610
him to choose some of the examples I'm

48
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,140
going to show you some examples of

49
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,950
attacks and vulnerabilities and I will

50
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,620
also show you some graphs done by my PhD

51
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,849
student Abiah I mean who's looking who

52
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:35,280
a PhD on statistical security for the

53
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,139
internet of things compared to the other

54
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:39,389
Internet of Things talks this will say a

55
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:40,920
little bit more about detection but

56
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,870
it'll be pretty high level so you won't

57
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,489
have to have your brains very engaged on

58
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:48,599
this last talk at the conference okay

59
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,000
this is where the title comes from it's

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,849
a Scottish prayer that you say at night

61
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:54,870
from Ghoulies and ghosties and

62
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,670
long-legged beasties and things that go

63
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,510
bump in the night

64
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,450
good lord preserve us it's anonymous but

65
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,400
those of you who don't speak Scottish

66
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,159
English I will translate Ghoulies our

67
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,769
little girls than their nasty malicious

68
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:09,269
creatures so they're like attackers

69
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:11,699
ghost is our little ghosts out there

70
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:14,239
will be a ghost story in this talk

71
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,909
long-legged beasties are I'm not sure

72
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:19,349
what they are but there's they're small

73
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:21,000
creatures with long legs sounds bit

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,669
nightmare and scary and things that

75
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:25,349
go bump in the night that is obviously

76
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:27,060
things in the internet of things that

77
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,040
have security problems or misbehaving in

78
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,650
some way good lord preserve us if the

79
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,510
good Lord doesn't preserve us then we

80
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,010
need the help of all the incident

81
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:40,889
response team so thank you all okay one

82
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,389
of my students said I'm probably the

83
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,220
person in the world who does least with

84
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,979
the internet of things all my friends do

85
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:49,139
more so I said okay what do you do more

86
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,370
sunny his name is sunny Milani well he

87
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,159
has Alexa he has a smart bulb and he has

88
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,340
a fan and they're all coordinated with

89
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,829
his phone and do proximity sensing and a

90
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:04,949
setup so this is the absolute baseline

91
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:07,560
for a final year computer science

92
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,979
students and the internet of things this

93
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:13,979
is the first toothbrush with artificial

94
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:16,680
intelligence and the reason why they

95
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,870
have to say that it's the first

96
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,909
toothbrush with artificial intelligence

97
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:23,250
is that there is more than one

98
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,930
toothbrush without agendas

99
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,909
I know three brands of toothbrush with

100
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:28,590
artificial intelligence what a wonderful

101
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,500
the world we live in

102
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,080
okay so this is evidence that the the

103
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,520
Internet of Things on the consumer side

104
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,830
is growing like Topsy as you all know

105
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,789
I'm sure on the industrial side it's

106
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:44,460
growing even faster on the within

107
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,310
companies

108
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,860
so the rest of the talk I will talk

109
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,159
about some attacks and vulnerabilities

110
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:55,259
I'll have a historical interlude about

111
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:58,590
Talos I will talk about weather stations

112
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,240
and doing anomaly detection for weather

113
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,069
stations and that the point of that bit

114
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,840
is to show you that when you find

115
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,669
statistical anomalies they may not be a

116
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:07,409
tax they may be misconfigurations or

117
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:09,000
other interesting things but you still

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,610
might want to know about them then I'll

119
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,689
talk about some stuff that's being done

120
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:19,199
by my PhD student with motion sensor

121
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,379
I'll talk more generally about different

122
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:23,669
classes of ways in which you might

123
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:25,500
detect things going bump in the night

124
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,740
things misbehaving then I have another

125
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,599
historical interlude since we all have

126
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:32,069
to talk about defending the castle I

127
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:33,569
will talk about defending the castle and

128
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:35,759
then I'll have a final section about the

129
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,740
state of of security for the internet of

130
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,250
things what we might do about it okay

131
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,439
and before I start the main part of the

132
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,409
talk if I mention your company or your

133
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:49,199
company that you're working for you can

134
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,009
come up to me afterwards and claim some

135
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:55,050
real Scottish shortbread because there

136
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,889
are lots of people until my shortbread

137
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:00,389
runs out because there are lots of

138
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:03,330
people doing really great work and some

139
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,099
of you are at this conference I want to

140
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:09,629
say thank you ok some attacks and

141
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:13,500
vulnerabilities I love this one this was

142
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,189
an attack through the thermometer in a

143
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:19,589
smart fish tank so the casino that had a

144
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:23,129
large fish tank and it had a thermometer

145
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:25,469
which was connected to the rest of the

146
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,229
Internet and 10 gigabytes of data was

147
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:30,150
exfiltrated through this phenomena

148
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,120
phenomena so this was an actual phishing

149
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,990
attack

150
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:41,680
and it was found by dark tray so if

151
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,330
there's anyone working today trace you

152
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,120
can have shortbread this has been

153
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,190
mentioned in Ken Monroe's wonderful

154
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,880
keynote which I missed but he he and

155
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,849
other people found problems with this

156
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:56,800
unbreakable smartlock this wonderful

157
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,610
headline is from the register ok so I

158
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,440
won't saying much about that because he

159
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,509
talked about that

160
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:08,800
this is Belkin Wemo that's a Belkin Wemo

161
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,840
smart plug looking sad right wonderfully

162
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,940
if you go on Flickr you can find a

163
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,740
picture of a Belkin Wemo smart plug

164
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,860
looking sad which is Creative Commons so

165
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,250
in August last year McAfee did a blog

166
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,389
where they talked about some

167
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:30,159
vulnerabilities and he said is Belkin

168
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:32,199
Wemo smart plug the next malware target

169
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,560
and in April it was discovered yes it

170
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,440
was bash Lite software was updated to

171
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,620
make use of these vulnerabilities so

172
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,479
McAfee and Trend Micro anyone there

173
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:46,780
shortbread keyless car theft cars are

174
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,550
things right they've got lots of

175
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,270
embedded computing and they communicate

176
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,930
wirelessly and the keyless cars where

177
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,270
you unlock them with a key fob or your

178
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:03,419
smartphone there's an attack called

179
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,979
keyless relay attack where the the

180
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:10,210
signal from the fob is amplified from

181
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,190
from inside your house and they can

182
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,719
relay it to the car that's parked

183
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:15,580
outside your house so they stand outside

184
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,740
your house relay the signal and use it

185
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,770
to unlock your car and this has led to

186
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,259
UK car theft claims being the highest

187
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:27,490
since 2012 and it's mostly keyless relay

188
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,400
attacks so 92 percent of the cars

189
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,990
recovered in Essex for those of you who

190
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,059
don't know Essex is a centre for the

191
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:37,360
used car trade in the UK were stolen in

192
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,940
this way so all of those of you who are

193
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,708
driving cars in the UK you're paying for

194
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:45,550
this through your insurance this is one

195
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,380
that happened just this month miss you

196
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,450
which is a cooking robot it can do all

197
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,850
sorts of things it's it slices it dices

198
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,400
it chops it heats does asparagus it's

199
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,200
amazing it turns out it was it's using

200
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,980
the Android 6.0 marshmallow operating

201
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,730
system which is no longer patched and

202
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,080
there's an undocumented microphone which

203
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,700
is not used because they wanted to

204
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,680
coordinate it with Alexa but they

205
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,970
decided not to do that so there's a

206
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,830
microphone in there so you can use these

207
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:19,090
machines to do phone calls fantastic and

208
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,250
this is a video of somebody using this

209
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,110
machine to watch YouTube while they're

210
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,960
cooking this is great fun when you do it

211
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,760
for yourself it's maybe not so fun if I

212
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,560
hacker decides it's sorry I should say a

213
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,130
cracker

214
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,790
hackers are good if if nasty little

215
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,750
Guney tries to take her of your cooking

216
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,140
robot and the last example I'm going to

217
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,150
give so these two colorful pictures the

218
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,250
one on the right is from Ann Arbor which

219
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,930
is where the University of Michigan is

220
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,600
the one on the left is a dance called

221
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,880
flavor dance with little umbrellas it's

222
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,540
fantastic dance and it's from herseif

223
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,010
where the university of pernambuco is

224
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,630
you should all dance forever you won't

225
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,200
regret it

226
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,820
I can't do it anymore because I have

227
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,170
middle-aged needs but you still do it

228
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,950
and these two universities what they did

229
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,900
was they looked at the 96 top-selling

230
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,870
things on Amazon which and they looked

231
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,940
at their companion apps 32 of them

232
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,800
because some things share apps actually

233
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,780
some apps share things as well but

234
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,360
mainly things cherubs and they looked at

235
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,070
the communication channel between the

236
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:26,680
app and the device and well 31% of them

237
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,410
there was no encryption of this channel

238
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,760
19% of them it's there are hard-coded

239
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,800
keys which you can recover by reverse

240
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,980
engineering the app and this is half the

241
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,130
apps or 38% of the things now I think

242
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,600
it's important to say that the attack

243
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,600
that this allows first the attacker has

244
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,640
to get onto your local network so you

245
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,660
may say well if the local network anyway

246
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,170
but so from from the local network they

247
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,270
can use this to get onto your app at

248
00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:00,590
your device your thing but as

249
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,910
the paper points out and I actually

250
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,380
agree based on work done by my

251
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,520
colleagues in hewlett-packard when I

252
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,800
worked in here Packard if they get this

253
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,050
wrong probably they'll get lots of other

254
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,750
things wrong if you find a thing where

255
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,520
the companion the communication with the

256
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,740
companion app isn't properly secured

257
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,480
probably there are other problems with

258
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,070
security problems with the thing based

259
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,730
on experience okay so that's the end of

260
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,490
the examples partly picked by my

261
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,290
assistant now I'm going to have a

262
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,300
historical interlude and it's about

263
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,110
Talos so this is a modern sculpture of

264
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,160
Talos does anyone know what century the

265
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,730
myth of tie loss comes from yeah we had

266
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:49,670
a hand up no we didn't okay whatever you

267
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,050
guessed it's probably earlier it's the

268
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:54,290
third century BC so this is the earliest

269
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,840
story that I know about security of the

270
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,210
Internet of Things and it's actually

271
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,370
about attacks on the security of the

272
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,150
Internet of Things

273
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,360
so Tallis was a thing Telos was a giant

274
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,020
made entirely of bronze and he had one

275
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,350
wire or vane from the top of his head to

276
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,610
his toe and his life fluid he called the

277
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,890
the life force flowed through that so

278
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:22,610
that's what made him active and he was

279
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,930
the burglar alarm for the island of

280
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,540
Crete so oh this is from the stories

281
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,580
jason and the argonauts by the way he

282
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,810
was the burglar alarm for the island of

283
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,370
Crete three times a day he walked around

284
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,170
the whole of the island quits pretty big

285
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,270
island but he was a giant and he would

286
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,130
look for ships that were coming to

287
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,570
invade the island and he would throw

288
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,790
rocks at them to sink them so this is

289
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:45,680
hacking back don't do that Jason the

290
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,260
arguments wanted to come and explore the

291
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,790
islands but they didn't want the Argo to

292
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,580
be sunk by Talos so they did a remote

293
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,550
social engineering attack there was

294
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,560
Medea who was travelling with Jason the

295
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,570
Argonauts and she had social engineering

296
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,540
pass and she remotely hypnotized tell us

297
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,060
she hypnotized Talos and that meant that

298
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:13,019
she could remove the pin in his toe

299
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:16,540
the pin in his toe was what kept the wah

300
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:21,100
and his his life source applied to him

301
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,670
so when she removed this bronze pin he

302
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,430
he was bricks he was bronzed he turned

303
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,009
into a heap of metal and they could

304
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,230
explore the island so this is a story

305
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,290
from the 3rd century BC about the

306
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,519
security of the Internet of Things the

307
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:38,499
problem the importance of protecting

308
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:41,829
your your security devices and the

309
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:45,699
dangers of social engineering as I'm

310
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,319
sure you all know you've come across the

311
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:49,600
name Telos before because Tallis

312
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,120
intelligence is the security part of

313
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,129
Cisco and the security team of Cisco and

314
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:55,420
they've done some really nice work in

315
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,249
this area finding vulnerabilities and

316
00:13:57,249 --> 00:13:59,019
attacks recently they find

317
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:00,879
vulnerabilities in the Kujo smart

318
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:03,220
firewall for the Internet of Things so

319
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,319
this is very much the same story as

320
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:07,389
Talos there's a problem with the

321
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,249
security so if you don't have a smart

322
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:10,839
firewall on your things you're

323
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:12,519
vulnerable if you do have this smart far

324
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,339
more vulnerable and it's called Cujo

325
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:22,720
which was a rabid dog anyway so the the

326
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,509
next section is about some work I did

327
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:28,629
looking at anomaly detection on Webber

328
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:30,519
stations so these are weather sensors

329
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:33,100
they they sense dust levels moisture

330
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,009
levels light levels they have latitude

331
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:39,879
and longitude Oh temperature so these

332
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,550
were weather stations in universities

333
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,790
and there's pretty much no motivation

334
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,160
for attacking a weather station in a

335
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,750
university you might want to attack or

336
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,209
by the station maybe if you were a rival

337
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:54,009
farmer and you wanted another farmer to

338
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:56,439
to get the wrong information about what

339
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:58,059
to do when to water their crops

340
00:14:58,059 --> 00:14:59,500
something like that but in the

341
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,199
university no so any anomalies that I

342
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:05,709
find are unlikely to be attacks but I

343
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:08,610
wanted to see what I could find anyway

344
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,860
so this is that oh the data is public

345
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,769
and it's from 85 - centers sensors in

346
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:17,439
seven cities and this is a tale of two

347
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:21,519
dust sensors what I was doing was pretty

348
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,829
bog-standard statistical anomaly

349
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:25,839
detection I was just seeing things that

350
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,220
was

351
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:32,340
Mystikal unusual and this is to dust

352
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,730
sensors so the x-axis is time the y-axis

353
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,870
is dust reading tweed are sensors that

354
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,570
have very unusual dust readings with

355
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,070
those Peaks and you can see it's about

356
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:49,230
the same time and okay however there's

357
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,230
something weird about it because

358
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,940
according to the Latin and shoot and

359
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,840
longitude one is in London and the other

360
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,770
one is in Boston so if they were both in

361
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:03,660
Boston this could be a lorry unloading

362
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,520
their load or a building site or

363
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,130
something but something weird is going

364
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:14,310
on okay and then a little bit later the

365
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,450
sensor that was in London hops in five

366
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:23,160
minutes to Antarctica and you can see

367
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,200
that it's a lot from the scale that's

368
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,880
the bottom of that South Africa you can

369
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,650
see at the top so this is this is a very

370
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,890
very large scale it's a way in land in

371
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,210
Antarctica it's nowhere near any

372
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,220
research stations and it's just hot that

373
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,590
so it's a hope about long-legged

374
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,760
beasties this is a very very long hop

375
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:46,530
okay what's going on well if you look at

376
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,810
the latitude and longitude readings for

377
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,340
where it said it was in Antarctica and

378
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,450
you change the round it's in Boston and

379
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,990
it's near MIT like the other one and I

380
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,090
think it was in Boston or long so why

381
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,160
did it say it was in London well here's

382
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,230
where it said that it was in London so

383
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:09,569
anyone see where that is it says it's a

384
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,280
number 10 Downing Street so for those of

385
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,720
you don't know that's the residence of

386
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,230
the British prime minister so what I

387
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,079
think is it's kind of unlikely that the

388
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,849
research where the station should be in

389
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,619
residence the British prime minister and

390
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:25,619
then in Boston so what I think is this

391
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,690
was the default setting and it was set

392
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,790
at the default readings of number 10

393
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,530
Downing Street just to say of course

394
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,200
this was not a real reading and then it

395
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,060
was reset to be where it was supposed to

396
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,010
be except somebody misconfigured it and

397
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,300
got the latitude and longitude the wrong

398
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,879
way around

399
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:43,619
this is not the only dust sensor that

400
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:45,359
has unusual latitude and longitude

401
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:47,219
readings there's a dust sensor in the

402
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:49,950
University of Rio that takes a trip up

403
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,559
to the top of the Sugarloaf Mountain

404
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:53,429
stays there for a bit and then comes

405
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:56,759
back down again and I think that was

406
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,919
real readings I think that probably a

407
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,299
researcher thought it would be nice to

408
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:01,529
see what the weather was like at the top

409
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:03,629
of the Sugarloaf Mountain isn't it just

410
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:07,919
an excuse to go up there but it's really

411
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,649
useful if you have a thing to know if

412
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:12,839
it's going walkabout because one common

413
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:15,089
attack that commonly happens to things

414
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:17,190
is they're portable is people steal them

415
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,279
and you can tell that the location is

416
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:21,719
and see whether their location is where

417
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:26,399
it ought not to be right this is

418
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:29,489
something going bump in the night so

419
00:18:29,489 --> 00:18:31,979
that you can see from the the key that

420
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:33,419
actually there are an awful lot of light

421
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:36,389
sensors plotted here but apart from one

422
00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:38,339
they all say zero because this is the

423
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:42,659
middle of the night but there's one that

424
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:46,349
suddenly has a reading that is larger

425
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:49,549
than the tropical Sun at midday

426
00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:53,879
okay so what I think this is is a local

427
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:56,309
power search it might possibly be

428
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:58,379
somebody taking a blowtorch to try and

429
00:18:58,379 --> 00:19:00,629
attack the thing but it's given the

430
00:19:00,629 --> 00:19:01,950
duration it's more likely your local

431
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,089
passage and normally if you're doing

432
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:07,830
data analysis automated data analysis

433
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,719
you just throw away this data right it's

434
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:12,179
it's anomalous you just clean the data

435
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:13,379
and you clean away anything like that

436
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:16,469
but I think it's useful useful to keep

437
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:17,940
and make use of this data because

438
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,339
firstly in some cases not in this case

439
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:23,609
it might be an attack and in this case

440
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:25,619
you might want to know that there had

441
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:27,210
been a local power surge that might have

442
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,149
affected your your sensor because after

443
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:31,580
that it could be fried it could be

444
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,690
having readings that you really should

445
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,950
discard so if you're you're monitoring

446
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,469
and collecting data from the internet of

447
00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:42,210
things maybe you want to keep some of

448
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,580
the extreme readings that you're

449
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,629
throwing away and just saying well that

450
00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:47,869
doesn't make sense

451
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:51,779
okay so conclusions statistical

452
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:53,200
anomalies anomaly is used in diff

453
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,460
ways in different parts of the industry

454
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,169
I mean statistical anomalies which means

455
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:57,850
just things that are very rare that's

456
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:58,480
all it means

457
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,789
in normal behavior and they may be

458
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:02,470
unusual but benign and I've showed you

459
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,269
some that are unusual but behind they

460
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,529
may be misconfigurations

461
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:07,210
in which case maybe you want to know

462
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:11,529
about them and apart from some attacks

463
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:13,210
so some attacks are designed to be seen

464
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,330
DDoS designed to be seen but there are a

465
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,950
lot of attacks that are designed not to

466
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,840
be seen there they're low and slow and

467
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,809
stealthy so if you're just looking for

468
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:25,480
the most unusual behavior you may only

469
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,220
pick up the misconfigurations and benign

470
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,700
stuff so what you should do is instead

471
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,590
of just looking for the most extreme

472
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,840
anomalies you should look for anomalies

473
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:40,179
that are anomalies that fit with attack

474
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:43,029
behavior so that you can't do an attack

475
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:46,389
without having a unusually high reap you

476
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:47,889
can't do an attack efficiently without

477
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:49,419
having an unusually high reading of what

478
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:53,710
you're looking at for example or you can

479
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,899
use where there's detection justice to

480
00:20:55,899 --> 00:20:57,519
filter out your data anyway so you only

481
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:00,340
look at things that are fairly unusual

482
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,169
and then you do more analysis on that

483
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:05,500
but I don't recommend that you take your

484
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,570
data from the internet of things and say

485
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,610
that the largest anomalies are the ones

486
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,230
you ought to look for you'll find you're

487
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,330
only looking at or mainly looking at

488
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:17,889
misconfigurations okay so now I'm going

489
00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:19,899
to talk about some work from my PhD

490
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:21,940
students she's looking at statistical

491
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,559
anomaly in the internet of things and

492
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,690
I'll show you some data from a motion

493
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:30,370
sensor going bump this is a Wemo motion

494
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,620
sensor and this is normal behavior right

495
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,730
the x-axis is time the y-axis is the

496
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,830
number of packets sent in a small time

497
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,500
interval and you can see that there's

498
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,210
one small time interval that looks

499
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,039
pretty anomalous it's normal behavior

500
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:51,279
and so if you want Peaks around 40 so if

501
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:53,950
you want to do typical threshold

502
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,480
detection you're going to have to send

503
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,139
your your unless you want quite a lot of

504
00:21:58,139 --> 00:22:01,149
a high rate of false positives if you're

505
00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:03,039
comfortable that that's fine but if

506
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,120
you're not comfortable with that you're

507
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,379
going to have to have your threshold

508
00:22:05,379 --> 00:22:06,690
above that look for

509
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,820
level and that means that there's lots

510
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,310
of white space in that diagram on the

511
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,320
left hand side where an attacker could

512
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,560
send out extra packets they could be

513
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,840
attack packets they could be for command

514
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,880
control without being detected so the

515
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,400
idea is to do something that can also

516
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,110
detect low and slow attacks which also

517
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,470
increase the amount of packets because

518
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,400
most of the attacks we're thinking of

519
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,310
would it if the if the the sent this

520
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,720
note motion sensor is then used to

521
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,040
attack or to laterally move to some

522
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,270
other thing or system then you're going

523
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,770
to see the outgoing packets that try to

524
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:57,000
do that use the right the CCDF don't

525
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,400
worry about that it's statistics you use

526
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,250
that to estimate the threshold for a

527
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,530
queue length assuming that you are

528
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,180
serving the packets at a particular rate

529
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,580
so you're going to have this mythical

530
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,080
rate at which you might be serving the

531
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,640
packets and you're going to work out the

532
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,560
queue length if you were serving the

533
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,090
packets at that rate what the queue

534
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,530
length would currently be and that's a

535
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:21,470
very very lightweight calculation okay

536
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,940
so what you do is you take a sample of

537
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,630
normal traffic or you just update your

538
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,730
models every so often assuming that

539
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,000
there usually won't be an attack and

540
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,010
find a queue length where it's very

541
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,230
unlikely that if you had been serving

542
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,690
them at one packet a second you would

543
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,520
get a queue length that would be larger

544
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,490
than that okay and then you give a an

545
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,590
alert or a warning that will not be

546
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,300
alert by itself you'll feed it in and

547
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,790
combine it with other suspicious things

548
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:56,370
about what's going on before you send it

549
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:01,080
to anyone of you if the queue lengths

550
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,700
the notional queue lengths you would

551
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,900
have got if you've been serving these

552
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,720
packets at a lower rate exceeds that

553
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,790
threshold so the next graph I'm going to

554
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,680
show you is different scale to this one

555
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,920
so the top of this one is 400 the top of

556
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,120
the next one will be much much higher

557
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,450
okay oh sorry no no this is the same

558
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,929
this is the queue length versus time so

559
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:28,609
this is as you serve traffic at a queue

560
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:31,489
length of one packet a second with

561
00:24:31,489 --> 00:24:32,929
normal traffic you can see the queue

562
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,999
length bounces up and down but it

563
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:39,710
remains bounded and my PhD student

564
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,179
worked out for this data the the

565
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:42,440
thresholds you want to earn for a

566
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,570
reasonable probability the the

567
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,480
thresholds that you want to give is 1250

568
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,999
I think and the next graph will be much

569
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:54,980
higher the sorry the the top of the

570
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,039
graph will be a much larger number than

571
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:03,019
just 400 okay so this black line is 1250

572
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:06,139
and this is what happens to the notional

573
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:08,509
queue length when there's a syn flood

574
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:10,279
attack you can see the notional queue

575
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:11,869
length just keeps on rising and very

576
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:15,980
quickly reaches the threshold because

577
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,489
there's more traffic in a period of time

578
00:25:19,489 --> 00:25:20,929
and there the aquiline that keeps on

579
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:26,409
rising so if you use different notional

580
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:29,899
yeah if you do different imagined

581
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:33,889
service rates you can both detect very

582
00:25:33,889 --> 00:25:38,059
bursty attacks very quickly and you

583
00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:39,950
couldn't detect slow and slow attacks

584
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:43,100
off for a bit of a longer time okay so

585
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,489
I've given one example of a way to here

586
00:25:46,489 --> 00:25:48,590
the bump and now again to talk it more

587
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,230
in general about general ways in which

588
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,210
you might do detection of problems and

589
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,549
the Internet of Things with the caveat

590
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:57,049
that I said before you shouldn't just

591
00:25:57,049 --> 00:26:00,850
look for the most anomalous anomalies

592
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:05,149
right so what I did was I looked at

593
00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:08,149
reports of real attacks not just fun

594
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,499
rebellious on the internet of things and

595
00:26:09,499 --> 00:26:11,570
I thought about how either how they were

596
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,529
detected or how you might detect them

597
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:16,249
whether there were other ways in which

598
00:26:16,249 --> 00:26:18,619
you might detect them and the first

599
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,359
category is broken rules now I don't

600
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:22,269
think these should be used for detection

601
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:24,619
these are things that really shouldn't

602
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:28,340
ever happen to your thing I think they

603
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,440
should be used for prevention and maybe

604
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,109
a you logger monitor if they're broken

605
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:33,809
but you should

606
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:36,269
stop them from happening and there's

607
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:40,729
more scope in things than in traditional

608
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:43,349
computing networks because in the

609
00:26:43,349 --> 00:26:44,969
Internet of Things each individual thing

610
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:46,919
usually has a more restricted behavior

611
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,869
now lots of there's only a certain

612
00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:50,759
certain type of behavior that it should

613
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:52,979
ever have and you should prevent it from

614
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:55,469
having other types of behavior but if it

615
00:26:55,469 --> 00:26:56,849
asked to do that then you should block

616
00:26:56,849 --> 00:27:01,469
it okay so these are broken rules and I

617
00:27:01,469 --> 00:27:03,989
think there's a lot something that gives

618
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:07,019
me hope is there's a lot of scope for

619
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:09,389
preventing bad things happening through

620
00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:10,859
broken rules in the internet of things

621
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:11,820
that there isn't in more traditional

622
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,299
computing the second set it is

623
00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:18,059
suspicious combinations so this is where

624
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:19,979
there are actions where it's not just

625
00:27:19,979 --> 00:27:22,649
one action by one thing but it's a

626
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:24,029
combination of actions by multiple

627
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:26,489
things or it's multiple actions by the

628
00:27:26,489 --> 00:27:30,719
same thing and again I think there's

629
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:33,899
maybe more scope in the Internet of

630
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:36,089
Things where we have a lot it was

631
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:37,649
particularly in the industrial Internet

632
00:27:37,649 --> 00:27:39,539
of Things where there are a lot of

633
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:42,690
things that are quite similar you would

634
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,879
expect to have similar behavior such as

635
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:46,979
dust sensors in the same city at about

636
00:27:46,979 --> 00:27:48,179
the same time you can have some

637
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:49,619
localized weather but you you're

638
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:52,049
unlikely to have exactly the same dust

639
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:58,549
peak if they're in different cities and

640
00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:01,830
so a lot of vendors are doing things and

641
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,690
there was a nice talk about attacking

642
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,379
the castle that talks about combining

643
00:28:06,379 --> 00:28:09,269
indicators from different parts of the

644
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:11,639
attack matrix I think we could be doing

645
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:12,899
more of that some of that is being

646
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,809
automated but I think there's scope for

647
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:18,229
more sophisticated piecing together of

648
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:22,950
less light of weaker indicators from

649
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,839
different parts of the attack matrix or

650
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:27,389
the kill cycle and some of those are

651
00:28:27,389 --> 00:28:29,399
about lateral movement as you can

652
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:33,119
probably see third thing is weirdness

653
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,570
statistical anomaly detection and in the

654
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,919
Internet of Things if you have several

655
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,809
things that ought to behave similarly as

656
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:41,639
well as looking at things that are very

657
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:43,470
rare given your past behavior of that

658
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,119
thing you can look at things that are

659
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,050
very rare given what other things

660
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:50,540
or logically to be behaving similarly

661
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,850
you can look at big differences between

662
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,290
one thing and the other things that

663
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:57,680
ought to be behaving similarly and there

664
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,120
are some examples there

665
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,010
the last one is thing sending out

666
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,900
weirdly large volumes of data and there

667
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,720
was a nice talk about detecting other

668
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,970
ways of statistical detection of DNS

669
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:12,530
exfiltration so an example where I where

670
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:15,830
we detected it just based on data data

671
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,880
volume anomalies unfortunately we never

672
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,500
managed to confirm that this was really

673
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,690
the case but when I was working at

674
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,820
Hewlett Packard we noticed something in

675
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,630
a network that's Hewlett Packard's was

676
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:32,240
managing where the most likely

677
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,330
explanation was data exfiltration by an

678
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:41,270
internet-connected fault myth truck one

679
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,670
example of sub example of weirdness is

680
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,820
things going bump in the night yes so

681
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,100
this is behavior that might be quite

682
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,600
usual if it was happening during office

683
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,880
hours but it's happening at an unusual

684
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,320
time of day or in the middle of the

685
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,170
night so configuration changes happen

686
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,720
logins passwords changes similar actions

687
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,810
by multiple things login attempts all of

688
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,810
those can are not necessarily suspicious

689
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,760
if you see the data but if you see a lot

690
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,180
of them at at a particular time of night

691
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,820
that's suspicious and an example of this

692
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,570
is another historical interlude this is

693
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:20,450
from 2000s the Marucci Shasu each

694
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:22,700
instance put your hands if you haven't

695
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,190
heard of that yeah lots of people

696
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,900
haven't heard of that okay this is a

697
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,080
problem with industrial control systems

698
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,100
in 2000 and there was a contractor

699
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:39,920
working for Merici in its it's in

700
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,490
Australia and he was helping install

701
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:46,160
radio operated sewage inquit equipment

702
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,620
and he was turned down for a job in the

703
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,140
council and in revenge he released he

704
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,110
fiddled with the controls and released a

705
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,510
huge amount of raw sewage into the

706
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:59,770
environments she's really not nice

707
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,020
there's a

708
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:05,490
good right up there and one of the ways

709
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,890
that it was determined that it was

710
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,170
detected firstly that this was actually

711
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,720
most malicious and just not it not just

712
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,960
faulty equipment was he was doing

713
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,540
multiple configuration changes during

714
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,970
the night that was spotted and that led

715
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:26,760
to his arrest okay now I'm going to do

716
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,590
another historical interlude which is

717
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:32,070
about defending the castle since this is

718
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,180
the theme of the conference I thought

719
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,680
I'd tell you about a castle that I know

720
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,780
a little bit about this is bamburgh

721
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,030
castle it's it's on the east coast of

722
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,010
England it's just near the border and I

723
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,240
know about it cause my grandmother used

724
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,950
to live there she rented a flat from the

725
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:47,760
family who owned it you can see that a

726
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,010
terrific feature of this castle is the

727
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,870
threat intelligence you can you can see

728
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,960
for miles around in all directions this

729
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,810
is the other side of the castle there's

730
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:00,330
a really strong perimeter wall it's six

731
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:04,530
feet thick made of stone it's crunchy on

732
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,330
the inside as well so defense-in-depth

733
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:09,120
as you see that square tower that is the

734
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,730
keep if you want to get to the important

735
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,780
people you have to get through the

736
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,520
perimeter wall and into the keep which

737
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,770
is well defended as well but I want to

738
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,890
say two features of this because are not

739
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,450
normally pointed out as security

740
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:24,420
features and one of them is the windmill

741
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,580
you can just you can see if you look to

742
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:29,130
the keep it's to the right of it it's

743
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,770
actually outside the wall but it could

744
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,050
have been inside the wall and it was

745
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:36,210
built in the 18th century and that was a

746
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:38,910
bit late because in the 15th century

747
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,250
during the Wars of the Roses there was a

748
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,530
siege of bamboo castle and bamboo castle

749
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,910
fell to a siege actually was besieged

750
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,040
twice but the first time it fell to a

751
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:51,090
seat rather than canva and they were

752
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:54,450
prepared for a short siege but not for a

753
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,430
long siege and in a long siege the

754
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,200
important thing is you have your food

755
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,580
and water supply well the water supply

756
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,320
comes from the heavens in Northumbria

757
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,820
every day but if they'd had the windmill

758
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,610
and a supply of corn they could have

759
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,590
kept on producing bread to feed the

760
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:13,050
troops for much and survive longer until

761
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,429
their reinforcements came in the

762
00:33:14,429 --> 00:33:15,629
or if the racists they might have

763
00:33:15,629 --> 00:33:18,600
survived that siege and the lesson for

764
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,490
this for security is of course do your

765
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,929
tabletop exercises do your long-term

766
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:24,299
planning have your resources in place

767
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:29,039
for when the worst happens okay and the

768
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,929
second thing I want to say is the ghost

769
00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:36,539
story so there's a story that's repeated

770
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,220
by a lot of people and happened to a

771
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,690
relative of mine that they're walking

772
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,220
around Bamburgh Castle late at night

773
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,460
they hear some steps behind them

774
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:47,460
footsteps behind them the footsteps get

775
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,499
nearer and nearer they turn around

776
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:52,799
there's no one there and they look in

777
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,649
the weather there's an alcove in the

778
00:33:55,649 --> 00:33:57,149
corridor that where somebody might have

779
00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:01,409
be hiding no nothing now this has been

780
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:02,909
repeated a lot of time so it was a

781
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:04,799
family story in in our family and then I

782
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,470
looked up online I saw it was reported

783
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,030
reported by a lot of other people now I

784
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:11,460
don't believe in ghosts I think this is

785
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,399
acoustic so I think bamboo castle you

786
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,000
can see it's stone the echoes of

787
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,730
footsteps echo pretty well off the walls

788
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,440
and the walls that are unusual Lang

789
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,569
angles within the castle I think

790
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:26,609
probably the sound of the footsteps gets

791
00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:29,099
echoed and sent somewhere else and you

792
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:30,179
hear them behind you but they're

793
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,000
actually coming from another direction

794
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,679
now think of this as a security defense

795
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,319
if you're invading this castle you hear

796
00:34:37,319 --> 00:34:39,389
the sound of footsteps behind you or

797
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:41,219
coming from one direction you flee away

798
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:43,829
from it you flee straight into the arms

799
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:45,179
of the guard because you're going in the

800
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:48,540
wrong direction maybe we could do that

801
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:53,339
some some something like that as a sort

802
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:55,440
of anti honey pot we have honey pots

803
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,609
which attract attackers to go to a part

804
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:02,069
of our castle that we want them to stay

805
00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:04,140
in that's easier to defend and we can

806
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,690
monitor them easily maybe we could also

807
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,849
repel them have a stick as well as a

808
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:10,559
carrot but the other thing it rides

809
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:12,900
reminds me of so that's just an idea for

810
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,460
you I don't know anyone wants to take it

811
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,369
up or anyone who's already doing this

812
00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:19,140
the other thing that reminds me of is

813
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,000
being scared of your own shadow so

814
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,200
another thing that might happen is

815
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,849
you're attacking the castle with a group

816
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:26,549
of other soldiers and you hear the this

817
00:35:26,549 --> 00:35:28,410
the noise of soldiers approach

818
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:31,070
so you back away but it's actually

819
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:34,470
somebody from your own party with the

820
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,470
the echo being reflected round and that

821
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,630
has happened to me in network security

822
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:43,620
in fact I I worked in network security

823
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,080
for long enough looking at ways of

824
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,630
detecting attacks that I came to the

825
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,950
conclusion that if you have an attack

826
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:53,160
detection method on a network that

827
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,130
doesn't finger the network security team

828
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,310
or the network security researchers as

829
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:00,450
probable attackers then it's not

830
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,900
sensitive enough maybe some of you have

831
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,090
had this experience and the reason is

832
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,890
that network security researchers do a

833
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,660
lot of things that if they were done by

834
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:14,280
normal people it would be really bad ok

835
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,990
I talked about windmills more about

836
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,470
windmills

837
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,690
so when wheels of course are things

838
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,920
there are things in the internet of

839
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,850
things wind turbines they have internal

840
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,200
computer and they have wireless

841
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,200
connections and this is a story from

842
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,370
data David Rogers of copper holes so

843
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:35,310
there was a set of wind turbines in a

844
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:38,520
very inaccessible location and there's

845
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,100
this really ingenious attack where

846
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,100
somebody reprogrammed them to dial a

847
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,160
premium rate phone number not fantastic

848
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,530
and it wasn't discovered until the bill

849
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,720
was maxed out and the maximum amount for

850
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,760
the bill was absolutely huge and this is

851
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,860
Jason Staggs on wind farms this is from

852
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,580
a DEFCON talk two years ago so he and

853
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,130
his co-authors looked at security of

854
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,560
wind farms and they found well you can

855
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:13,620
see it's pretty bad and the kicker is

856
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,570
the last thing he said this is exactly

857
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,310
what we would expect from industrial

858
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:24,840
control systems ok state of security of

859
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,670
the Internet of Things what do we think

860
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:33,720
good medium bad anyone like to vote yeah

861
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,210
I don't see many thumbs up so what I

862
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:40,640
think is it's pants

863
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,809
right so for those of you who are not

864
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:45,490
fluent in British English pants means

865
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,140
not very good

866
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,329
it doesn't mean terrible he's just not

867
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:51,069
very good I think it's better than it

868
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:55,510
was and pants also means underwear this

869
00:37:55,510 --> 00:38:02,309
is a pair of Arduino enabled disco pants

870
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:05,859
the colored LEDs they flash on and off

871
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:09,940
in the dark it's fabulous

872
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,130
I don't know of any security problems

873
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,210
with this which is just as what you

874
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,349
don't want security problems with your

875
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:17,079
underwear the reason I'm showing you is

876
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:18,490
when you think about the state of the

877
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,920
security of the Internet of Things you

878
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,450
can get a bit gloomy and I wanted to

879
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,730
cheer you up

880
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:27,849
okay so why is it so pants why do we

881
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:29,200
have pants security in the Internet of

882
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,300
Things well firstly it's it's new

883
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,839
technology or a lot of it is so a lot of

884
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,420
consumer or industrial Internet of

885
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,339
Things systems they're trying to do

886
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:40,660
something that nobody managed to do

887
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,890
before they're introducing completely

888
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,270
new functionality when you introduce

889
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,920
completely new functionality and new

890
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,260
product line you're trying to make the

891
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,720
thing work all your effort is trying to

892
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,750
make the thing at least not fall over

893
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,630
and security can suffer because of that

894
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:58,990
in other cases there was an old product

895
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:02,440
which was perfectly secure and its

896
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,430
security model had no connection and now

897
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,230
it's been hooked up you're increasing

898
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:11,410
the attack surface and it's no longer

899
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,599
secure another thing that I think will

900
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,730
be a problem with us for a while is

901
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,980
early things are still in use so early

902
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:22,900
things so later versions of the things

903
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,849
are secure but there are early things

904
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:26,470
that are still in operation they're

905
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,460
still out there they're still being

906
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,059
attacked some things depending on what

907
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:33,369
it does have limited computing resources

908
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:36,369
or storage or with the industrial

909
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:41,380
control systems you-you-you they have to

910
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,599
have very very quick response time you

911
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,150
don't have the option of turning it off

912
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,040
and turning it on again quickly if you

913
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,510
do that with a steel mill it takes six

914
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:53,000
months there's a big attack surface

915
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,670
it's not just the physical thing it's

916
00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:01,090
also the local network it's also the the

917
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:05,630
the network interface it's also the UI

918
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:08,180
if there's a UI and it's combinations of

919
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,300
all of these there are large supply

920
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,700
chains large and long supply chains if

921
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,730
you can you have a thing it could be

922
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:19,460
developed in by small teams lots and

923
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,320
lots of different small teams developing

924
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,970
different layers based in different

925
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,410
countries none of those teams have a

926
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,600
security expert and all of those teams

927
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,040
might inadvertently leave in a problem

928
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,940
there are problems with patch

929
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,800
development and distribution with some

930
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,170
kinds of things you can't really update

931
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:39,830
them but others you could but they don't

932
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,480
really have a good process for doing so

933
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,340
and the last thing is a few companies

934
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,660
not even trying I'm thinking in

935
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,250
particular of privacy there are some

936
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,160
privacy architectures which would

937
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,450
architectures for some types of things

938
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,810
that would I'm thinking yeah

939
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:56,060
particularly consumer things where the

940
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,440
business model is you collect as much

941
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,230
data as possible with the consent of the

942
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,390
user and that means that they have an

943
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,070
architecture that is less private than

944
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:08,180
if you were going just for privacy okay

945
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:13,880
so here are some suggestions the right I

946
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,050
should say I've already talked about

947
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:17,120
detection I have not said anything about

948
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,460
incident response because I would feel

949
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,230
ridiculous saying it in front of this

950
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:26,000
audience but you do need that if for

951
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,290
those of you who are working with small

952
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,030
and medium-sized companies one thing

953
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:32,480
that you can do is help them get better

954
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,520
security development processes or more

955
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,350
security development processes there are

956
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:39,260
also security platforms for the Internet

957
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,640
of Things and this is good because it

958
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,080
means that they don't have to have all

959
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,300
the expertise in-house they can build on

960
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,330
what other people have done you can also

961
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,850
help them get a process for responding

962
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:53,690
to a vulnerability report some of them

963
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:55,580
really want to do the right thing but

964
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,200
they just don't have a good process in

965
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,790
place and they haven't thought through

966
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,710
and they haven't talked with their

967
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,080
supply chain about what happens when the

968
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,790
vulnerability report comes in and how

969
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,960
they deal with it

970
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,359
like to give kudos to Zeman's who do

971
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,859
this really well I think we should be

972
00:42:12,859 --> 00:42:15,430
thinking about business models

973
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,359
alternative business models and just

974
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,040
snarfing all the the data in the world

975
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,690
and using it for advertising I think

976
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,520
that there are more imaginative business

977
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,980
models out there for consumer things

978
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:31,310
also for industrial things don't fund

979
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,880
insecure things so there's been this

980
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,160
unfortunate fact that it's really easy

981
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,950
to get funding to build a new thing but

982
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,690
it's really expensive to get funding to

983
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,599
make the things secure don't do it if

984
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:46,460
you're part of angel investment or

985
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:50,300
government funding make it a condition

986
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,640
of your funding for the development of a

987
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,740
thing that security is built in from the

988
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:58,070
first place don't put insecure options

989
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:00,020
in things security sounded so those who

990
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,260
do have involved in security standards

991
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,580
there are some security standards where

992
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,790
for backwards incompatibility there's an

993
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:10,430
auction which is known to be insecure

994
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:11,750
which is included in the security

995
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,980
standard may be deprecated that's

996
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,530
included and if that one is the easier

997
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,270
one to implement that is the one that

998
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:21,380
everyone will implement check out old

999
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:24,710
things Lenny said this in her keynotes

1000
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,740
so if you have things in your company or

1001
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,599
in your house that you can no longer

1002
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,510
keep secure check them out don't keep

1003
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:35,240
them hanging around you may have to do

1004
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,240
effect factory reset as well and finally

1005
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,970
this is part of part of what I just said

1006
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,339
try not to be part of the problem so

1007
00:43:43,339 --> 00:43:45,619
when you buy or procure things for

1008
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:47,420
yourself with your businesses or for

1009
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,250
your organizations do ask hard questions

1010
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,080
about security and you know the right

1011
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:55,820
hard questions to ask so let's make

1012
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,690
things better okay

1013
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:02,570
now anyone who wants shortbread can come

1014
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:03,830
get shortbread and then we'll have

1015
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:05,330
questions but first I have a question

1016
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:07,970
for you I imagine that there are some

1017
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:09,140
people in this room who've had

1018
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,910
interesting experiences with attacks and

1019
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:12,230
the Internet of Things if you could talk

1020
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,560
about it I'd be very interested to hear

1021
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,480
say what happens whether it was an

1022
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,849
interesting thing

1023
00:44:18,849 --> 00:44:19,959
how you dealt with it what the

1024
00:44:19,959 --> 00:44:21,579
responsibles anything you feel like

1025
00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:28,439
saying okay shortbread

1026
00:44:37,329 --> 00:44:41,509
Thank You Miranda any questions comments

1027
00:44:41,509 --> 00:44:45,619
claims of biscuits come on you need

1028
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:49,880
sugar it's Friday Oh

1029
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,549
anyone who says anything also gets drawn

1030
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:12,140
we have four microphones yeah show us

1031
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:17,029
how it's done thank you for that that

1032
00:45:17,029 --> 00:45:18,679
was that was very entertaining and this

1033
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:20,719
isn't quite as serious of a question as

1034
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:22,789
I'd like but where you put up to the

1035
00:45:22,789 --> 00:45:24,589
fact that our outgoing chair works for

1036
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:26,269
Siemens before you gave them kudos for

1037
00:45:26,269 --> 00:45:28,009
their incident response policy because

1038
00:45:28,009 --> 00:45:29,329
he's gonna be interminable to deal with

1039
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:33,009
for the next month or two I had no idea

1040
00:45:33,009 --> 00:45:35,269
well thank you for making our life

1041
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:36,660
painful

1042
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:40,049
[Laughter]

1043
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,710
if Derek hadn't blown your cover I was

1044
00:45:56,710 --> 00:46:07,180
going to so i'm goes i am one of the

1045
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:10,330
vendors who is also making stuff so when

1046
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:12,880
you said that if it is old

1047
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,040
check it out would replace it it sounds

1048
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,500
easy but when you have I don't know the

1049
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,930
whole refinery or smelter and then yes

1050
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:22,150
check it out and replace it it's not

1051
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,710
easy because number one you say all the

1052
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:27,040
guys will kill you when even suggest to

1053
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,290
do such a kind of thing yes so I am

1054
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:32,560
afraid yeah I mean in theory I agree but

1055
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,310
in practice it's slightly more complex

1056
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:38,110
thank you for that very good point yes

1057
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:41,260
so obviously there are the things you

1058
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,810
can do you can try and block it as much

1059
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:46,510
as possible you can also plan when you

1060
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:49,030
buy there are some applications where

1061
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:52,060
you can't do it's melted in but when

1062
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,070
you're in the procurement in the first

1063
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:55,180
place you think of at the end of the

1064
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,310
life cycle as well but you're absolutely

1065
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:59,080
right it's more complex problem and

1066
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:13,150
thank you for that kado appear national

1067
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:16,600
services into finland it happens to be

1068
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,080
so that in our remit in a legal remit is

1069
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,950
we actually have a right to scan the

1070
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:27,400
valve country and it's has been a very

1071
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,860
interesting year we do it actually we

1072
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,560
have we don't annual scan every April

1073
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:38,500
and and and the results are not getting

1074
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,620
better

1075
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:43,360
we are doing a quite a bit of outreach

1076
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,000
on that we are actually reaching through

1077
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,240
the ISPs all the various automation

1078
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,960
systems that we encounter in it route

1079
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,870
but the even with you as we going to in

1080
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:58,600
the outreach the numbers are not really

1081
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,470
really really going down yeah and even

1082
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:05,170
we are also sharing the education so

1083
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:07,030
there is a quite a bit of work to do on

1084
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:15,640
this area I must say oh I should say

1085
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:24,820
these are not vegetarian hi I'm not

1086
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:28,330
doing this for the shortbread just

1087
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:31,210
wanted to share with you I think the

1088
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:33,850
weirdest thing we found on the internet

1089
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:36,100
and that was the healing system of a

1090
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,530
ship you know what the healing system is

1091
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:42,910
yes and the response from the vendor was

1092
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:46,060
maybe the most priceless you know we

1093
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,310
told them in the first they were healing

1094
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:51,790
system yes wait a second you need to

1095
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:54,820
talk to another guy okay yes we have a

1096
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,350
healing system yeah it's only internet

1097
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:00,390
no it isn't yes it is oh it isn't

1098
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:03,180
finally we had to send them a screenshot

1099
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:06,340
it disappeared and reappeared we keep

1100
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,610
later

1101
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:23,109
I am Carlos from the Portuguese in rent

1102
00:49:23,109 --> 00:49:25,760
first a small a spammer I don't need a

1103
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:32,569
cookie I'm not a gambler but if I was I

1104
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:35,480
would bet that when you asked about the

1105
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:40,160
state is I would say would show a slide

1106
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,280
with a desert but he said you you show

1107
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:48,319
the slide with which is a bit optimistic

1108
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:52,670
then thanks for this talk

1109
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:55,839
thank you very much

1110
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:03,550
I can start a countdown well I've got a

1111
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:09,450
countdown really if there are no others

1112
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:19,930
thank you very much Miranda every bit is

1113
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:21,460
amazing we've expected

1114
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,040
I have also tweeted that I'm hoping in

1115
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,970
Issa who are based on Crete looking out

1116
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:32,740
for bronze robots taking care of us and

1117
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:35,040
I think at this point I hand over to

1118
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,400
