1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,120
[Music]

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,640
thanks for the introduction yeah you've

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,639
actually set me up uh perfectly for for

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,080
the presentation

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,040
um but before i do that uh just on a

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,120
personal level i just want to echo the

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,680
uh statements by by chris and alexander

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,000
and silvio um obviously regarding the

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,720
current situation ukraine um you know

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,160
we're we're thinking about our

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,000
colleagues there and obviously hoping

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,880
for a

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,119
uh swift peaceful resolution uh to the

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,119
situation

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,760
so let me jump into my presentation now

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,600
all right

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,520
so uh

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,040
everyone plea please let me know if you

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,120
can't see that um

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,960
but as chris said i'm going to be

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,480
talking a lot about critical

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,480
infrastructure sectors uh sector sea

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,440
certs

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,000
um but more than that uh what i really

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,760
want to emphasize in my presentation

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,879
here today

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,480
um is the idea

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,079
of integrating your sector c certs into

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,438
the rest of your country's

30
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,760
cyber security capabilities

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,960
which we call a national ecosystem

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,560
so i'm going to talk about a couple

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,320
different things today

34
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,960
um here in the presentation so i can get

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,400
the slides to

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,040
to advance

37
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,799
there we are

38
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,520
so

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,960
in order to get to that point where

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,360
we're really understanding uh not only

41
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,040
how sector c cert functions

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,840
independently um but how sector c certs

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,560
can interact with one another

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,280
uh and with the rest of your uh

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,119
national ecosystem

46
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,399
including

47
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,079
law enforcement including national

48
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,200
c-cert

49
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,920
including private sector and all sorts

50
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,399
of other entities

51
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,799
we want to talk about first what exactly

52
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,119
a sector c cert is what our expert

53
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,200
expectations are of an organization that

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,040
we call a sector c cert

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,719
um then we'll talk a little bit about

56
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,960
this framework that that that the

57
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,399
software engineering institute has

58
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,560
developed for building sector c certs um

59
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,840
and then we'll talk a little bit about

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,920
that national ecosystem what exactly it

61
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,720
is uh and how organizations can interact

62
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,160
there

63
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,560
um i do have a short case study that i

64
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,920
hope to get to

65
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,560
um if i have time and will hopefully

66
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,640
illustrate some of the things that um

67
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,480
that i'll cover here in the rest of the

68
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,560
presentation

69
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,920
so first of all

70
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,800
you know

71
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
i i think sector c cert is probably a

72
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
term that a lot of us are familiar with

73
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
um maybe some of us aren't quite as

74
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,120
familiar

75
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,560
but coming up with a real solid

76
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,720
unified definition of what a sector c

77
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,440
cert is is kind of a challenge because

78
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,120
this term means different things to

79
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,040
different people right

80
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,160
how do you define what a sector is um

81
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,760
you know are we talking about a sector

82
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,440
of an economy does it have to be

83
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,599
critical infrastructure sector there are

84
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,640
a lot of different questions

85
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,599
and then

86
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,080
extending that from sector to sector c

87
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,959
cert

88
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,680
what exactly is a sector c cert and what

89
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,280
does it do

90
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,360
this is a definition that can vary from

91
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,599
country to country um and then we see

92
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,760
additional terms we see terms like

93
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,200
isac

94
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,560
we see terms

95
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,400
now we're starting to see things like

96
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,680
sector socks and things like that

97
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,360
and different cyber security centers

98
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,280
partnerships uh public-private

99
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,959
partnerships so there's all these

100
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,480
different terms and it can be a bit

101
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,720
confusing to understand what exactly

102
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,640
we're talking about

103
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,080
so for the purposes of this presentation

104
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,599
and the purposes of the framework that

105
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,440
i'm going to talk about

106
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,560
we call

107
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,120
we consider a sector c cert um any

108
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,200
incident response capability that is

109
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,239
responsible for a subset of a country or

110
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,319
or an economy

111
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,120
now

112
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,280
this means that

113
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,680
it includes a lot of different things so

114
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,400
our definition is pretty pretty wide and

115
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,640
pretty all-encompassing so we include

116
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,640
things like i sacks

117
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,519
under this definition even though

118
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,720
you know these are slightly different

119
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,239
organizations with slightly different

120
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,360
missions

121
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,640
when we're talking about it for the

122
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,639
purposes of this framework and of this

123
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,079
sort of discussion about national

124
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,680
ecosystems

125
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
we think we can sort of categorize and

126
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,919
group all these organizations together

127
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,479
so just keep that in mind throughout as

128
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,360
i go through the rest of the

129
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,800
presentation

130
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,000
of course

131
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,240
each organization is different

132
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,840
but for what we're talking about here we

133
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,320
can group them together

134
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,479
um there are a couple important things

135
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,080
that we have to understand about sector

136
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,000
c certs

137
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,680
there are different tasks and different

138
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,759
functions that a sector c cert

139
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,520
can carry out

140
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,040
incident response of course is one of

141
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,160
them

142
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,759
one of the more important tasks of

143
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,880
sector c cert or any sector capability

144
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,600
is communication and coordination

145
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,520
both among the members

146
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,680
of that sector but also with other

147
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,520
sectors and the rest of that national

148
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,840
ecosystem that i'll talk about

149
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,759
um hosting discussions providing

150
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,360
training

151
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,759
and building trust and confidentiality

152
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,560
among members are all important

153
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,400
things that a sector cert

154
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,600
or sector capability can do

155
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,479
again

156
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,720
not every sector c cert is going to be

157
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,880
doing all of these tasks

158
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,000
some may

159
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,840
but some may only perform a subset of

160
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,120
these tasks

161
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,240
that's okay

162
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,479
that's still a sector c cert but again

163
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,759
we have to keep in mind that each

164
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,759
organization is different

165
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,160
and that might be true even within a

166
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,160
country you may have sector c certs

167
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,080
within a country

168
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,520
that are performing

169
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,400
um

170
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
at one set of services and then for a

171
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,720
different sector there may be a c-cert

172
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,000
that performs a different set of

173
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,199
services

174
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,960
so the question and the challenge then

175
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,400
becomes how do we get these

176
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,479
organizations to work together and to

177
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,400
cooperate

178
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,960
for the betterment of of the whole

179
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,080
um

180
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,160
one thing that i do want to emphasize

181
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,520
here

182
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,840
is that sector caesars are unique

183
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,840
organizations uh they differ from

184
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,240
national sea certs or the piecerts that

185
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,199
chris would have just talked about um

186
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,319
so

187
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,280
there are some things that we we say a

188
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,280
sector c cert must do

189
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,039
in order to be considered a sector c

190
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,560
certain

191
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,160
the most important thing

192
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,080
is working to bridge the gap between

193
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,680
public and private

194
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,639
sector entities in a given country so a

195
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,960
financial sector sea cert for example

196
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,560
may work to bridge the gap between a

197
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,039
financial regulator and private sector

198
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,199
banks

199
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,360
um that's a key function of a sector c

200
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,560
cert and and perhaps one of the only

201
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,639
things that we can really say that a

202
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,720
sector caesar has to be doing or we may

203
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,360
not consider it a sector ceaser

204
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,520
again just something to keep in mind

205
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,400
um

206
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,880
but when we have sector c certs we can

207
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,280
say that they provide certain advantages

208
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,479
over these other organizations uh over

209
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,000
um national c-certs or things like that

210
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,759
the two advantages that are most obvious

211
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,599
and most important for sector c certs

212
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,639
are scalability and expertise

213
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,319
the scalability

214
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,319
is important to understand

215
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,440
because

216
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,880
having implementing a regime of sector c

217
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,759
certs

218
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,120
allows the rest of your organizations

219
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,560
the rest of your incident response

220
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,800
organizations to sort of focus on

221
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,880
different missions so when we start to

222
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,440
deploy sector c certs now we see that

223
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,120
the role of a national sea cert for

224
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,000
example can be expanded and can focus on

225
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,680
other things

226
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,319
and in terms of expertise

227
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,080
we see particularly in critical

228
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,000
infrastructure or critical information

229
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,720
infrastructure sectors um that there is

230
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,639
a lot of specialized knowledge and

231
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,520
specialized skills necessary to respond

232
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,440
to incidents in those

233
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,960
sectors

234
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,759
so

235
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,039
for example the threats that are faced

236
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,680
by a specific sector may be unique to

237
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,400
that sector um think of

238
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,120
uh

239
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,639
power

240
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,479
critical infrastructure

241
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,639
financial sector

242
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,199
all of these different sectors will have

243
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,759
specific threats that aren't seen in

244
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,599
other sectors so when you develop a

245
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,759
sector c cert you're developing an

246
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,240
organization or a body that can really

247
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,559
focus on gaining expertise in those

248
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,080
particular areas

249
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,919
gaining expertise against particular

250
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,799
types of attacks gaining expertise with

251
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,720
particular software systems or hardware

252
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,920
systems

253
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,000
um so the level of specialization that

254
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,080
is enabled by a sector c cert

255
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,600
is one of the unique

256
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,519
and critical roles that a sector ceaser

257
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,839
will fill

258
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,600
so

259
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,080
with an understanding of what a sector c

260
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,680
cert is and what we mean when we use

261
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,959
that term

262
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,560
the next term that we have to really

263
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,200
define or describe is that national

264
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,839
cyber security ecosystem

265
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,240
so for a little bit of background

266
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,880
um what when we were developing this

267
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,720
sector c cert framework that i'll talk

268
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,320
about here in a little bit

269
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,200
um

270
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
we were thinking about

271
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,480
a lot

272
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,200
about the role of the of the sector cser

273
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,519
and how that sector ceaser interacts

274
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,399
with

275
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,240
the rest of the organizations in a

276
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,320
particular country

277
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,800
and what we kind of realized was that

278
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,080
there are a lot of different

279
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
interactions between all of the

280
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,480
different organizations that occur on a

281
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,920
daily basis

282
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,000
or an annual basis

283
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,160
you have day-to-day communications

284
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,920
information sharing

285
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,160
sharing of threat information sharing of

286
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,480
vulnerability information

287
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,959
but then you also have less frequent

288
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,399
interactions

289
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,640
such as trainings

290
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,560
or awareness buildings or just

291
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,959
cooperation

292
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,279
and then you have ad-hoc cooperation

293
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,640
in the form of incident response uh or

294
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,880
something of that nature

295
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,800
so there are a lot of different ways

296
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,959
that these organizations would interact

297
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,200
or work together

298
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,680
and we realized that we needed a term to

299
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,240
describe all of those interactions

300
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,760
between all of those different

301
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,560
organizations again those could include

302
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,360
law enforcement national c certs

303
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,519
private sector entities

304
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,360
regulators

305
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,079
and in some cases this could even

306
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,959
include transnational organizations

307
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,880
such as first

308
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,279
or some of those sector c certs that are

309
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,360
international in nature

310
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,320
such as financial sector

311
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,120
or transnational corporations

312
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,640
so there are all these different

313
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,560
stakeholders and all these different

314
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,240
interactions

315
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,040
so

316
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,640
we thought that this was best described

317
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,000
as a national cyber security ecosystem

318
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,040
and that

319
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,560
term describes both the organizations uh

320
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,800
and the interactions that occur on a

321
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,079
daily basis and on a sort of more more

322
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,120
spread out more like an annual basis

323
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,079
so

324
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,720
there are a couple different

325
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,560
important things to think about and to

326
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,920
consider when we talk about that

327
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,160
national cyber security ecosystem

328
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,399
uh one is the central role of a national

329
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,480
sea cert in that national cyber security

330
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,760
ecosystem

331
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,839
national c-cert tends to be

332
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,399
at the center of it and they tend to be

333
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,320
the most common

334
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,600
or most heavily relied upon

335
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,760
organization for coordinating and

336
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,040
communicating across that ecosystem

337
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,279
and then the second important factor

338
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,240
is establishing trust

339
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,680
within the national cyber security

340
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,519
ecosystem

341
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,120
a lot of the interactions are based on a

342
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,720
level of trust between the different

343
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,079
organizations

344
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,760
without that trust

345
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,120
the types of helpful and necessary

346
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,399
interactions

347
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,560
and sharing of information starts to

348
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,720
break down

349
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,800
so when we're thinking about sector c

350
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,680
certs

351
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,360
we have to think about

352
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,000
okay how does my sector c cert interact

353
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,920
with the national ecosystem

354
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
which means thinking about

355
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,680
how will my national sea cert interact

356
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,320
with the national c-cert

357
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,720
and how will my sector sea cert

358
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,279
establish trust with all of the other

359
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,839
stakeholders and all the other players

360
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,240
within this national ecosystem so these

361
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,600
are really important things to keep in

362
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,000
mind and important considerations uh

363
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,760
when you're developing or implementing a

364
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,560
sector c cert

365
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,680
so in order to

366
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,160
answer some of those questions

367
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,480
we started to go back um when we were

368
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,880
developing the sector c cert framework

369
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,200
and think about how do i develop these

370
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,279
sector c certs or these sector-based

371
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,680
capabilities

372
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,399
so we broke the process down into these

373
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,120
six steps and these six steps that we

374
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,959
described within the framework are

375
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,440
designed to take you from a current

376
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,920
state which we call the as is state

377
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,320
to a future state which we call the 2b

378
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,680
state

379
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,120
now the acid state can be either

380
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,360
nothing it can be that way we don't have

381
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,880
a sector c cert

382
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,800
or it can be that we have a sector c

383
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,959
cert but we want to improve its function

384
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,959
and further integrate it into that

385
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,600
national cyber security ecosystem

386
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,399
so

387
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,880
our 2b state we hope

388
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,079
is a functional capable sector c cert

389
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,079
that is integrated with that national

390
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,240
cyber security ecosystem

391
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,160
and is capable of interacting with its

392
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,199
peers

393
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,959
and sharing information and being

394
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,160
successful and operating in that way

395
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,440
so to do that

396
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,839
we break the process into again these

397
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,600
six steps

398
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,000
first is considering prerequisites

399
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,399
these are things like understanding

400
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,760
who's hosting your sector c-cert um who

401
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,519
are the constituents who are all the

402
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,279
stakeholders

403
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,959
i'm thinking about how are you going to

404
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,199
fund and staff and operate this sector

405
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,720
cesar

406
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,040
step two is gathering information this

407
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,279
is going out and talking to all the

408
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,480
stakeholders

409
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,160
understanding what their requirements

410
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,399
are of the sector c cert

411
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,000
what they hope the sector sea cert will

412
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,519
be able to provide

413
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,160
and what they may be able to do to

414
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
contribute to the functioning and the

415
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,600
success of the of the sector ceaser

416
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,079
step three is to organize all of that

417
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,560
information that has been discovered

418
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,199
and evaluate the gaps so the gaps will

419
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,279
help you understand

420
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,360
what is missing between your current as

421
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,240
is state and your desired to be state

422
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,920
once you've evaluated and understood

423
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,480
those gaps you can build a roadmap that

424
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,720
will help you get from the as is to the

425
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,920
2b

426
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,880
so for example if you discover that you

427
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,199
have a nascent

428
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,760
undeveloped sector c cert but you want

429
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,560
to have a fully integrated sector c cert

430
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,000
your roadmap may describe things like

431
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,240
how do i establish protocols for

432
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,560
communicating and sharing information

433
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,880
with other sector c certs or with the

434
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,399
national ceaser

435
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,680
it may describe how i implement new

436
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,839
incident response capabilities for this

437
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,759
sector ceaser

438
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,920
so the roadmap is really going to be a

439
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,680
detailed document

440
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,320
that describes not only what you want to

441
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,680
achieve

442
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,440
but how you are going to achieve it

443
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,399
that lends into step five which is to

444
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,720
plan and implement the sector c cert

445
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,959
implementation is where we see in our

446
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,000
experience a lot of sector c search run

447
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,720
into trouble right it's one thing to go

448
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,959
and gather information

449
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,120
and to say okay here are the challenge

450
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,880
areas here are the gaps

451
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,920
okay we're going to put together a

452
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,480
document that says what we want to do to

453
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,920
fill those gaps

454
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,839
but when it comes down to actually

455
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,759
implementing that and this is where

456
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,639
organizations run into challenges

457
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,639
so in the framework itself

458
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,440
which is published on the seis website

459
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,920
we have a lot of of ideas and

460
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,480
suggestions and plans for how to avoid

461
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,079
those challenges

462
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,440
for example

463
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,000
securing stakeholder buy-in ahead of

464
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,040
time

465
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,399
building trust i mentioned the

466
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,160
importance of trust in that national

467
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,040
cyber security ecosystem

468
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,519
so things like that understanding where

469
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,040
you're going to run into problems ahead

470
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,279
of time will help you plan

471
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,800
to have a successful implementation

472
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,880
and then the last part of this process

473
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,800
is to conduct post-implementation

474
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,720
activities

475
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,839
to understand where you've been

476
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,800
successful and where you might need to

477
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,199
do additional rounds of development in

478
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,800
order to achieve your goal of really

479
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,040
developing that sector c cert and

480
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,800
integrating it into that national

481
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,119
ecosystem

482
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,039
as i mentioned the national ecosystem i

483
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,199
want to emphasize that there are two

484
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,280
points in this process two steps where

485
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,760
we really see the importance of

486
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,400
interacting with that national ecosystem

487
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,079
understanding who all the stakeholders

488
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,959
are

489
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,880
and getting their buy-in and their

490
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,319
participation for this process

491
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,160
obviously at the beginning when you're

492
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,559
thinking about the prerequisites

493
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,400
you really need to consider

494
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,640
again who are all the stakeholders

495
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,799
in this process

496
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,120
who are the organizations that my sector

497
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,919
ceaser will rely on for

498
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,240
cooperation for communication for

499
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,760
assistance

500
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,160
and then which organizations will be the

501
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,600
constituency of this sector cesar

502
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,679
all of those things again are what will

503
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,679
make up your national cyber security

504
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,559
ecosystem for a given country so this is

505
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,720
where you're really defining your

506
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,200
national cyber security ecosystem

507
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,640
so you have to keep that in mind as

508
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,360
you're doing that part of the process

509
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,440
then again in step five as you start to

510
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,640
implement

511
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,080
it's very important to keep in mind the

512
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,320
national cyber security ecosystem

513
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,880
because this is where um we start to see

514
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,720
actually the national cyber security

515
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,880
system being affected

516
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,960
by the presence of this

517
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,039
either this new organization this new

518
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,520
sector c cert or by the sector c cert

519
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,000
that now has an expanded role

520
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,280
or a more

521
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,240
in-depth or more detailed mission

522
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,200
so a lot of times the challenges here

523
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,160
are that new roles or responsibilities

524
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,640
are being allocated to a sector c cert

525
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,559
and this is a change from what was

526
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,080
happening previously

527
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,120
so maybe previously a national national

528
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,679
sea cert was handling certain tasks for

529
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,520
certain roles that are now going to be

530
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,840
done by a sector ceaser so we have to

531
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,200
understand how this affects the

532
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,600
operation of the national sea cert

533
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,320
and also how it affects the constituency

534
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,080
that previously worked with the national

535
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
c-cert and now we'll be working with the

536
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,160
sector ceaser

537
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,760
so again thinking about all the

538
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,039
stakeholders and how they're being

539
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,480
affected

540
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,400
at different parts of this process is is

541
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,120
really important

542
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:15,920
um

543
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,919
[Music]

544
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,280
i'm going to skip that

545
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,039
a couple important things that

546
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,360
we want to keep thinking about as we

547
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,480
talk about

548
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,080
um especially integrating that that um

549
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,600
sector c cert with the national cyber

550
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,600
security ecosystem

551
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,400
is services services that the sector csr

552
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,160
will offer

553
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,320
um and services that the sector ceaser

554
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,760
may not offer

555
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,000
um so again a lot of you are probably

556
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,760
familiar with the first c cert services

557
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,880
framework

558
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,440
um this breaks the function of a c cert

559
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,240
into several service areas and then sub

560
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,400
areas or subservices of course

561
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,280
and what i just want to emphasize here

562
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,840
is that

563
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,440
when you're thinking about the functions

564
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,760
of the sector c cert and the rest of the

565
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,080
national cyber security ecosystem you

566
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,440
have to consider

567
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,039
which services will be offered by which

568
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,440
organization essentially

569
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,159
so in the framework the sector seizure

570
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,440
framework

571
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,159
we have in an appendix

572
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,799
that describes different service areas

573
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,360
and considerations for which may be

574
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,679
appropriate for a sector c cert

575
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,840
and which may be best left to other

576
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,679
organizations like national sea cert or

577
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,200
private sector

578
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,840
or things like that

579
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,440
but as you're establishing your sector

580
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,120
cesar or thinking about developing a

581
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,960
sector c cert

582
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,039
what you want to do is understand what

583
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,960
is needed for that organization to

584
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,720
provide those services

585
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,200
what sorts of knowledge skills and

586
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,600
ability your sector cert will need if

587
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,000
they want to offer different services

588
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,760
so we cover all that

589
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,400
in the framework

590
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,360
there all right i already talked a lot

591
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,720
about integrating with the national

592
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,159
cyber security ecosystem um but i think

593
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,159
it it bears repeating some of the

594
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,960
specific considerations um again if

595
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,840
you're

596
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,360
operating creating or or improving a

597
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,159
sector c cert

598
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,600
we want to ask some of these key

599
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,559
questions

600
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,960
as we go through the process

601
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,480
i mentioned the relationship between the

602
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,679
sector c cert and national sea cert

603
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,600
that is critically important

604
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
of course sometimes we see

605
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,159
it's the case uh particularly in in

606
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,400
developing countries

607
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,200
sometimes there is no national sea cert

608
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,640
but sectors may be ahead of the national

609
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,720
government in implementing csr

610
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,280
capabilities

611
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,600
so we see in particular frequently the

612
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,320
nashville or i'm sorry frequently the

613
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,640
financial sector

614
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,120
can sometimes be ahead of

615
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,200
the national government in implementing

616
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,760
a sector-based capability

617
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,880
um but you have to understand even then

618
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,080
um what may be the future state uh in

619
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,480
terms of if a national c-cert is created

620
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,440
later on how will my sector ceaser

621
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,120
interact with that

622
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,200
and even if there's no national c-cert

623
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,400
um what are government requirements

624
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,720
um for instant response or for cyber

625
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,679
security is there law enforcement

626
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,720
are there national security

627
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,320
considerations are there legal

628
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,000
requirements

629
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,039
and so these are all important

630
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,559
considerations

631
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,480
um and then finally

632
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,880
how will sector c cert address

633
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,440
issues of bridging the gap between the

634
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,320
public sector and the private sector

635
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,159
again this is a critically important

636
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,080
part of of understanding that national

637
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,320
cyber security ecosystem

638
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,080
and understanding how

639
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
or what role the cyber the national or

640
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,760
the sector seizure

641
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,158
will play

642
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,159
[Music]

643
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,760
so i just wanted to go through a quick

644
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,840
case study that i i think illustrates

645
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,679
some of

646
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,320
some of the challenges that that you can

647
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,159
see in this process

648
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,760
of developing a sector c cert

649
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,600
so i'm not going to name the country

650
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,200
that we partnered with

651
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,760
but this case study is based on an

652
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,440
actual uh partner that that the sei

653
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,280
uh worked with to develop sector-based

654
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,520
capabilities um

655
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,760
so just by background

656
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,919
uh in this country prior to our

657
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,159
engagement with them

658
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,320
this country had implemented

659
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,400
a bunch of cyber security and incident

660
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,000
response measures

661
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,080
in their sectors

662
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,880
there had been government directives

663
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,360
not not legal legislation

664
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,840
but sort of executive actions that had

665
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,200
required these sectors to create new

666
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,120
cyber security capabilities for the

667
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,799
purpose of securing that country's

668
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,880
critical infrastructure

669
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,720
however

670
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,039
what had happened in this country is

671
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,960
that there was no strategy

672
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,720
um there was no

673
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,840
um ever put into developing

674
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,039
any strategy or understanding how all of

675
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,440
these organizations would interact not

676
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,039
only with each other

677
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,039
but with it with the national government

678
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,360
and with law enforcement and other

679
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,120
organizations

680
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,360
as a result um

681
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,960
essentially there was a lot of wasted

682
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,559
time and effort

683
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,159
as these sectors went through the

684
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,840
process of trying to establish the

685
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,720
capability um but without any guidance

686
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,640
or without any understanding of what the

687
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,600
other sectors were doing

688
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,000
um so we started our collaboration

689
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,679
with this country and our engagement

690
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,320
there in in 2016

691
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,520
and we started by doing um basically a

692
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,840
review of the current state

693
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,120
um and helping them to develop a

694
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,360
vision to move forward in sort of an

695
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,720
organized

696
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,400
collaborative fashion across sectors

697
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,720
so we developed an action plan which

698
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,480
would be equivalent to that road map

699
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,159
that i would have described or that we

700
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,000
described in the um in the framework

701
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,120
and we've revalidated that

702
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,080
work plan or that action plan

703
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,360
by

704
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,039
discussing it with all the stakeholders

705
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,480
in february of 2017.

706
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,120
to implement this again implementation

707
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,720
is the stage where a lot of challenges

708
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,760
can occur

709
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,240
um we did a couple of things

710
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,360
we did some workshops and some training

711
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,520
um but what we did is we brought the

712
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,440
national c cert and the sector c cert

713
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,960
partners together

714
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,559
and had them go through these workshops

715
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,200
and these trainings together so they all

716
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,600
understood um things like roles and

717
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,279
responsibilities

718
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,120
and had an opportunity to meet each

719
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,600
other in person and interact with each

720
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,440
other and to establish some of those

721
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,679
relationships that are critical to the

722
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,919
success of that national cyber security

723
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,960
ecosystem uh so you can see here just a

724
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,520
list of trainings and topics that we um

725
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,320
that we did with these organizations

726
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,840
and then at the end we made a few

727
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,600
recommendations

728
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,080
we recommended that the

729
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,360
the government

730
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,480
and the stakeholders in this country

731
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,279
put together a series of documents um

732
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,960
and a series of artifacts that would

733
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,279
help guide them to implementing their

734
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,360
sector c certs and integrating those

735
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,799
sector c certs

736
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,960
with the rest of the ecosystem that they

737
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,039
had in existence in this country

738
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,159
so

739
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,200
we recommended that they put together a

740
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,400
charter for each of their organizations

741
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,799
concepts of operations

742
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,840
um staffing guidelines training

743
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,799
guidelines um

744
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,320
and then we put together a list of

745
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,240
sort of work that they that these

746
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,760
organizations could be doing and could

747
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,919
be cooperating on

748
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,640
and we had them define these in policy

749
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,840
and in documentation

750
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,919
so that everyone knew

751
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,840
with what each organization would be

752
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,600
doing and understood how they would

753
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,559
interact with each other

754
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,440
so that said um with that example

755
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,440
um i just wanted to sort of

756
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,880
bring it back to

757
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,760
um

758
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,840
the section ceaser framework

759
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,480
um and talk about that really just a

760
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,159
little bit

761
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,600
um again the purpose of the document is

762
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,080
to establish you know what a sector c

763
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,559
cert is and and how we develop one

764
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,159
um so

765
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,000
we understand when we're developing

766
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,200
sector c cert um that there are

767
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,799
different procedures and different

768
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,840
policies that are applicable based on

769
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,720
um

770
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,559
what the sector needs

771
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,559
what technology it's using what the

772
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,200
sensitivity of that sector is

773
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
and what critical infrastructure or

774
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,799
non-critical infrastructure is being

775
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,360
protected

776
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,799
so again

777
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,799
that document is published on the sei

778
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,120
website we encourage you to

779
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,880
to go check that out

780
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,159
and learn a little bit more about the

781
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,840
process

782
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,919
and a little bit more about implementing

783
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,760
sector c certs and integrating them into

784
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,360
the national uh ecosystem

785
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,919
[Music]

786
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,039
so that is it that's my presentation i'd

787
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,120
be happy to answer any questions uh at

788
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,520
this point

789
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,799
i saw there were some there have been a

790
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,559
couple of comments on the chat channel

791
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,440
uh

792
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,120
i think andrew cormax talked about going

793
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,960
open mike if he wants does anyone want

794
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,799
to raise a hand or put something in the

795
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,799
chat

796
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,640
uh

797
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,520
andrew

798
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,600
oh no

799
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,880
okay i guess we'll leave it there there

800
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,000
are comments

801
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,080
if you want to address those in the chat

802
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,840
yeah i see a couple comments

803
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,200
um uh thank you mark for sharing the

804
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,559
link uh to our sector seasirt framework

805
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:16,910
um

806
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,720
[Music]

807
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,159
and

808
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,480
i see uh ammar has also shared uh just a

809
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,480
resource there

810
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,279
um

811
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,760
yeah into andrew cormick uh to your

812
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,240
comment i absolutely agree um with the

813
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,080
the distinction that you've made between

814
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
uh c cert

815
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,080
and something like uh i guess like like

816
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,600
an isac

817
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,600
or a different organization

818
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,039
um

819
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,399
i think

820
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,480
it just to go back to

821
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,159
you know where i started

822
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,799
for the purposes of this

823
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,679
process that i'm talking about um we

824
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:54,399
actually

825
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,799
in in the framework we use the term

826
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,039
sector-based capability

827
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,440
as sort of a more broad all-encompassing

828
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,399
term just to talk about the process of

829
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,640
developing a capability

830
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,080
um that will be part of your national

831
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,640
cyber security ecosystem

832
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,440
um

833
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,840
i kind of slipped into just using the

834
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,000
term sector c cert

835
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,399
which is is one type of sector-based

836
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,799
capability uh an isac is a different

837
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:21,840
type of

838
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,559
sector-based capability

839
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,240
but when we talk about the process of

840
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,919
developing these capabilities

841
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,000
integrating them with the national

842
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,360
ecosystem

843
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,960
we think that the same process is

844
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,120
applicable regardless of if you're doing

845
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,919
a c cert or an isac or something else

846
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,159
um but obviously you have to understand

847
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,520
that

848
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,039
the actual function of the team the

849
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,039
functioning of that capability will

850
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,120
differ depending on its mission and what

851
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,960
type of team it actually is whether it's

852
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,520
a c-shirt or an i-sack so yeah i

853
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,880
completely agree with the with your

854
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,600
observation yeah

855
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,440
good yes

856
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,640
it's easy to

857
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,440
to confuse the terms and i apologize i

858
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,799
was not using

859
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,559
sector-based capability

860
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,000
um yeah

861
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,159
i think you're absolutely right

862
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,600
i've seen this as well that you know

863
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,120
people banks talk to banks because they

864
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,480
understand each other they can have a

865
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,480
common taxonomy they've got the same

866
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,399
problems and making sure that that

867
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:17,840
doesn't stay purely in the banking

868
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,679
sector and reaches that national search

869
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,760
so you can then look for patterns across

870
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,120
multiple sectors is really really

871
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,960
important so that was very interesting

872
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,240
thank you justin i appreciate i

873
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,600
appreciate you taking the time to spend

874
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,360
this for that

875
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,799
that's great

876
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,080
more one more raised hand

877
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,320
what more

878
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,039
yes so does this work actually yes looks

879
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:39,760
good

880
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,840
uh some comments from myself because we

881
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,519
actually have done this so then also

882
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,200
there is the austrian engine sector's

883
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,799
research and

884
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,320
some points from our experience

885
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,919
it's not easy to get the whole sector to

886
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,000
come together and and reach a common

887
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,480
goal not easy at all for some it's

888
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,919
easier for some others it's quite

889
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,360
impossible

890
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,240
but once you get this this really helps

891
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,760
second point is funding uh in our case

892
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,440
uh the electoral season is actually

893
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,000
funded by the sector itself

894
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,679
that's

895
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,240
has some positive effects because uh

896
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,600
that way it's clear that the sector is

897
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,760
theirs it's their um

898
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,960
their

899
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,360
the team that they're buying services

900
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,600
from it's not a government uh forcing

901
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,000
them to interact with them it's a

902
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,480
supplier for the for the sector and that

903
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,240
makes for a very

904
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,360
different type of relation than between

905
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,120
the private sector and the government

906
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,200
entity

907
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,399
this really helps in some way because

908
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,720
very depending on your country but

909
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,159
in some places

910
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,399
it's not easy to tell

911
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,159
employee talk to to this government

912
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,399
government agency versus

913
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,679
talk to this our self-selected uh

914
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,559
supplier of services this is a very

915
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,600
different

916
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,840
way of interaction it really helps

917
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,440
so if you have any other questions

918
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,399
regarding our experience uh just

919
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,559
ask me in the chat or whatever we're

920
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:16,799
happy to share our experience thank you

921
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,279
thank you for that those are really

922
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,880
really important comments

923
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,760
um and i think they emphasize the fact

924
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,919
that and again we talk about this a bit

925
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,720
in the framework um the every

926
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,880
deployment of one of these capabilities

927
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,600
is unique and different and needs to

928
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,320
meet the specific requirements of of the

929
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,799
country or the sector um at the time um

930
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,480
you know the idea of

931
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,200
of

932
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,799
who should host this and who should fund

933
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,799
it is is really important

934
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,640
uh for example we see in some countries

935
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,679
um

936
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,399
the

937
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,039
regulatory body for a particular sector

938
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,679
may also host the sector c cert

939
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,760
um and there are advantages to that

940
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,360
model but there are disadvantages as

941
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,000
well right um so if if your financial

942
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,720
regulator is also the government

943
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,320
organization that hosts a financial

944
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,760
sector sea cert

945
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,560
uh

946
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,399
or a sector capability um

947
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,719
you know you could have some some

948
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,119
hesitancy over reporting of incidents or

949
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,399
things like that

950
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,440
because

951
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,399
the people who are supposed to be

952
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,839
sharing the information are also your

953
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,679
regulator um

954
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,639
there's

955
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,040
of course advantages to that model um

956
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,399
but i i think to your point there

957
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,000
you have to carefully consider the

958
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,480
advantages and disadvantages and and do

959
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,879
whatever is going to be um

960
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:39,839
most

961
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,000
most advantageous for your specific case

962
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,639
i very much agree with that i think we

963
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,760
had similar things in the uk with the

964
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,679
bank of england who wanted to join to

965
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,520
learn how people to defend themselves

966
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,199
but also were the regulators so yeah

967
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,280
that's a very important point

968
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,599
excellent i think that's it justin thank

969
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,920
you very much
