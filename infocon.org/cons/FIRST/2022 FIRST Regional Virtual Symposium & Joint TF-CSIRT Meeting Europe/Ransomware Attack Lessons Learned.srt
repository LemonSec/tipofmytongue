2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,160
so good morning good evening good

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,559
afternoon to everyone

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,679
um francesco de luca from the response

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:14,639
team

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,799
of

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,520
in italy

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,800
our speech will be about a

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,439
serious ransomware attack

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,359
we suffered

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,439
recently

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,640
and

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,479
from which we learned

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,919
some interesting things

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,040
uh i'll take just

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,239
few minutes to explain the context

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,879
the customers and the services we

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,239
deliver

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,280
as well as their the rationale we adopt

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,120
for asset protection but the

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,480
most interesting stuff would be in the

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,480
paolo presentation so

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,358
i will boring you just for a few minutes

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,680
uh

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,479
jcpmod is one of the most important

26
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,960
italian touch companies

27
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,760
that

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,040
creates

29
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,320
digital services for regional and

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,479
national public administration

31
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,000
just a few

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,119
notes

33
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,560
about our infrastructure and services

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,640
we have a data center

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,759
certified taa rating three

36
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,680
we are a certified cloud service

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,280
provider

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,200
we obviously are an accredited regional

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,040
scissors

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,200
we manage the whole

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,399
regional connectivity network

42
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,159
and we deployed a smart data platform

43
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,680
for big data that is unique in italy

44
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,360
uh

45
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,040
a little more figures we have a 130 more

46
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,719
than 130 consortium members

47
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,959
two data centers

48
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,920
we employ more than one thousand

49
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,520
professionals

50
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,480
with more than two thousand services

51
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,200
that we monitor twenty four

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,959
seven

53
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,120
in this context

54
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,239
how we

55
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,040
protect our data

56
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,480
just using

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,440
difference in depth

58
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,959
that you know

59
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,200
is an information

60
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,360
ethereum prose

61
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,319
where

62
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,120
several layers of defense are stationed

63
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,040
all through an itis system

64
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,720
this approach

65
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,720
takes security vulnerabilities in

66
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,480
technologies human resource and of

67
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,800
course operation

68
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,080
throughout

69
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,879
the whole system's life cycle

70
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,120
different decks

71
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,720
has different control but just talking

72
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,840
about

73
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,560
technical control so we know that

74
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,720
these comprise

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,360
security essential

76
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,720
in order to

77
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,920
secure network system or resource

78
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,920
through specified

79
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,879
hardware or software

80
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,599
you know that these controls refer to

81
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,319
the software security measure that are

82
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,000
installed

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,799
in the iit infrastructure you have to

84
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,640
protect

85
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,239
such as

86
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,400
ids ips

87
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,360
web application firewalls

88
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,040
biometrics

89
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,360
password manager vpn and so on

90
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,400
but

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,640
but

92
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,599
to put

93
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,760
this attack

94
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,720
in the correct context

95
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,159
is important to consider

96
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,400
that our consortium is made up of 130

97
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,010
national government agencies

98
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,799
[Music]

99
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,280
these are entities

100
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,720
of very different size

101
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,519
ranging from a few employees to

102
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,560
thousands of employees

103
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,320
moreover

104
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,560
we deliver more than 2000 services but

105
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,960
not all are on all customers

106
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,360
maybe we have a capillary control of

107
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,160
services and infrastructure

108
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,440
for customers or for some of them

109
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,479
while for others we only deliver

110
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,360
some other services

111
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,960
and

112
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,880
the same

113
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,600
is true for cyber security

114
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,639
for some customer we protect the whole

115
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,320
infrastructure

116
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,240
or maybe that we manage security only

117
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,360
for

118
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,520
little services for just for some

119
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,039
services

120
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,759
to other customers

121
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,160
so we have a really

122
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,479
really various

123
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,160
scenario

124
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,520
and

125
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,759
now what happens

126
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,960
when you are attacked

127
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,759
on

128
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,720
such a large and

129
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,800
heterogeneous surface

130
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,680
happens that the response team

131
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,080
entered the field

132
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,039
and

133
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,520
an exciting lesson starts

134
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,960
and now

135
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,758
i lead the word to paolo thank you

136
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,198
thank you francesco i need the screen

137
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,800
okay

138
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,840
and

139
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,479
here we go

140
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,400
okay so let's have a short journey into

141
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,840
the receiving end of a ransomware attack

142
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,639
uh the following slides are dedicated to

143
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,840
those of you who have not been yet part

144
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,120
of this game

145
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,360
and i hope it's the majority of you

146
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,479
because it's

147
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,520
very

148
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,479
good experience very emotional but very

149
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,719
hard

150
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,440
so

151
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,160
the previous attacks we had to handle

152
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,000
where in 2014 that sort of pretty a long

153
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,199
time ago

154
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,160
where users were falling victim of

155
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,960
crypto locker on their machines

156
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,840
so they were getting data encrypted on

157
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,080
their local disks and mounted the

158
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,479
network drives so that was easy just

159
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,960
restore the machine and the data from

160
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,800
the backups

161
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,120
but then we got our first large-scale

162
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,400
ransomware

163
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,599
attack in by the end of 2021

164
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,840
so last

165
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,560
year as francesco said before

166
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,840
the victim had a hybrid configuration

167
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,120
so

168
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,240
there they built the buy email the email

169
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,319
platform is in the cloud on which we

170
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,360
have no visibility at all no logs and no

171
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,639
content

172
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,680
also the internal network devices like

173
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
routers and switches

174
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,680
we have no visibility because they are

175
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,240
handled by a third party company

176
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,160
of course we cooperate with them but we

177
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,080
don't get the laws

178
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,560
fortunately the firewalls the more

179
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,479
important ones like the one towards

180
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,960
internet and towards us and our other

181
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,840
customers they are managed by us so we

182
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,919
get the logs

183
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,000
the domain controllers

184
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,560
is under our control as well their logs

185
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,639
and the endpoint security

186
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,199
this means the classical antivirus

187
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,720
product so nothing really fancy

188
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,680
and as a part of our defense

189
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,879
we also use commercial and free

190
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,160
platforms

191
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,280
that monitor the internet facing systems

192
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,520
they look like they look for vectors

193
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,680
risk vectors like

194
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,879
old or insecure tls ssl configurations

195
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,960
they warn you if there are some

196
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,400
unpatched or outdated systems

197
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,280
as well as if some

198
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,360
uh ip starts offering services on an

199
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,559
open without encryption or unsecured

200
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,599
port

201
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,039
how could that happen

202
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,799
we sell also just the connectivity so

203
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,599
in our cloud platform for example so one

204
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,560
of our customers and consortium members

205
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,200
can come to us just buy an ip address

206
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,279
and start

207
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,080
giving services like a remote desktop or

208
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,120
an ftp without any encryption out to the

209
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,440
whole internet so we get notices from

210
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,640
that

211
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,800
and and also the missing security

212
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,680
application headers that are in some

213
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,560
cases are not so easy to implement on

214
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,080
older systems

215
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,959
we also use other services that report

216
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,600
the outgoing traffic towards malicious

217
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,959
ips like honeypots or ip networks that

218
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,000
were seized by the police forces

219
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,240
so all these sources

220
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,880
are extremely useful to assess and

221
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,600
reduce the exposure but they were not

222
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
enough

223
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,680
how did they get in how did we get the

224
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
ransomware attack did they use the

225
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
remote code execution

226
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,160
no we have protection for that

227
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,560
did they use a zero day

228
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,519
no

229
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,800
did they maybe use a cbe exploit

230
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,760
no

231
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,040
they came before the lock 4j by the way

232
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,720
they just came through

233
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,680
one

234
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,160
one stolen remote desktop credential

235
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,720
so this was the the first lesson we

236
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,920
learned very hard but it's nothing new

237
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,640
actually it's that the human factor by

238
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,000
past thousands of years worth of defense

239
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,240
technologies

240
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,360
after that

241
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,079
the actor just followed step by step the

242
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,160
county playbook

243
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,560
the day after we learned that the conti

244
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,600
playbook had been released let's say and

245
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,839
it was available on internet and it was

246
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,800
very useful reading through it to follow

247
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,600
the steps of the attacker into the

248
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,800
network of our customer

249
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,199
anyway

250
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,360
from the analysis

251
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,279
of the lateral movement

252
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,360
and the timeline of the attack we also

253
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,160
learned a few things that we actually

254
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,360
reused

255
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,600
uh in the coming months in the coming

256
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,640
months

257
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,120
so the first use of the stolen

258
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,720
credential

259
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,000
was two days before the weekend break

260
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,040
that means thursday for us

261
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,920
and the reconnaissance took place during

262
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,519
working hours on thursday and friday

263
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,640
so both their actual user and the

264
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,360
attacker were using the systems

265
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,079
during working hours nine to five

266
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,839
so there were no real alerts triggering

267
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,160
and then finally he came back on

268
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,320
saturday afternoon or evening something

269
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,120
like that and launched encryption

270
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,360
that went through until someone noticed

271
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,920
this pretty standard stuff i think as

272
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,160
what from what i've read of ransomware

273
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,399
attacks

274
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,720
so those of you that are

275
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,839
that have been in the security field for

276
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,480
maybe a decade have probably heard of

277
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,760
the statistic

278
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,200
that a certain percentage of servers is

279
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,839
forgotten every year in every data

280
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,680
center that means that like one two or

281
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,160
five percent of servers

282
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,320
becomes forgotten because the maintainer

283
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,720
goes leaves or because nobody uses it

284
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,880
but forgot to switch it off and

285
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,800
uh release it

286
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,200
and well we discovered during the

287
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,720
ransomware attack that this statistic

288
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,920
applies

289
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,720
to endpoints as well actually applied

290
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,480
probably to endpoints but that was the

291
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,680
case

292
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,399
so just imagine a customer

293
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,440
with 10 000 seats

294
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,839
and even if just one percent per year

295
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,120
of the

296
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,720
of the computers

297
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,800
become forgotten that means really a lot

298
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,160
uh so

299
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,399
that's how it came

300
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,839
the encryption

301
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,720
the first systems to be exploited

302
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,440
were some personal under the desk

303
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,639
servers

304
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,920
that were powered up 24 7. maybe now

305
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,240
they're not so common anymore

306
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,639
with virtual infrastructures but

307
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,880
this computer was like 10 years old and

308
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,360
it was under desk it was first before it

309
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,959
was

310
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,959
an endpoint for a user and then it was

311
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,680
turned into a server for some certain

312
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,279
activities

313
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,079
so after compromising those machines

314
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,519
other endpoints

315
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,079
uh running 24 7

316
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,399
got to the encryption phase

317
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,560
and why they were powered on well

318
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,279
because they had to since our customers

319
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,920
are public administrations some of them

320
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,720
also run a public safety service like

321
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,320
could something could be like local

322
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,880
police so those computers had to be

323
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,760
operational on saturday night

324
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,639
but in other cases it was just lazy

325
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,440
owners that they didn't switch off their

326
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,920
computers when going home

327
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,639
so they learned the hard way losing

328
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,880
their data that they should not waste

329
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,560
electricity and switch off the computers

330
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,720
so the attacker's success was a

331
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,760
combination of weekend and unattended

332
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,760
endpoints

333
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,399
then we come to the reaction phase

334
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,760
it was monday morning about 8 in 8

335
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,320
a.m that the first reports

336
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,120
of an accessible files were coming in

337
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,360
through mail so

338
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,160
web chats and especially through the

339
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,600
old-fashioned

340
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,959
cell phone

341
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,880
and within 30 minutes

342
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,880
we managed to stop the spread of the

343
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,440
encryption

344
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,600
this is another thing another lesson we

345
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,959
learned is that work from home was a big

346
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,279
plus

347
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,839
for example there is no limit to the

348
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,639
number of expertise that you can involve

349
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,880
in a matter of seconds

350
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,040
and you don't need to wait for everyone

351
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,440
to get to the office building

352
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,680
so we were all operational just in a

353
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,760
matter of minutes i was there

354
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,320
in a web call that started growing and

355
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,959
growing and growing we came to have more

356
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,880
than 20 people

357
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,360
in the meeting and just imagine

358
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,440
20 more people around the physical table

359
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,160
and just have one person speak

360
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,320
at the time we are italians we are

361
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,800
latins we cannot do that

362
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,920
uh but when you are on a virtual meeting

363
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,839
that that is possible you have no

364
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,959
background noise from side talks

365
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,560
they do occur

366
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,360
uh

367
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,560
when you have to tell something to

368
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,959
someone someone else you write it in

369
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,759
text in the comment chat or in separate

370
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,800
choice

371
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,040
so it's silence and it's really very

372
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,680
very effective

373
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,240
uh but having separate chats has a

374
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,600
drawback

375
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,720
after a few days working on the case

376
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,360
it happens that you know that someone

377
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,040
told you something

378
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,360
that wrote it some that wrote it in a

379
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,839
chat but you cannot find it anymore so

380
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,880
we think it's good uh habit to have a

381
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,680
notepad your own notepad and it's better

382
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,040
if that if it is temper tamper resistant

383
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,240
like pen and paper just don't forget to

384
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,959
bring it with you if you go physically

385
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,758
to your office

386
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,920
well we were lucky

387
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,120
that the reaction task force was

388
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,320
composed of senior i.t staff

389
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,519
that means people with gray hair

390
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,800
with 10 or more years of experience

391
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,560
within our company

392
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,360
and

393
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
the customers

394
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,839
so that means we knew the infrastructure

395
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,440
by heart

396
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,720
so whenever we need an information

397
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,440
the lookup was much faster when

398
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,320
searching it in a human memory rather

399
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,720
than searching it on a tool

400
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,440
and by the way the human memory

401
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,639
cannot be compromised

402
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,560
for example this kind of information is

403
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,600
like an ip subnet where is it physically

404
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,480
located the customer in the customer in

405
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,439
this case has like 20 or 30 different

406
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,160
physical buildings spread over a

407
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,480
geographical area and it was very

408
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,760
important to be able to locate where a

409
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,199
machine compromise machine walls

410
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,240
also

411
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,439
the

412
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,359
domain controllers

413
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,280
of the customer were planned or

414
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,919
scheduled to be updated in the upcoming

415
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:28,880
weeks

416
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,480
so the i our windows it staff was

417
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,520
already trained to build and rebuild

418
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,679
domain controllers from scratch so they

419
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,039
knew exactly

420
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,280
what to do when they had to rebuild it

421
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,080
and

422
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,880
just feed the backup from few weeks

423
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,160
earlier so the fact is that we were very

424
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,480
effective as everyone knew his own role

425
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,320
and also

426
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,440
some hatches were buried from years long

427
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,840
stories

428
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,280
year's longer relationship with the

429
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,160
customers allowed us to limit their

430
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,320
operations uh

431
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,240
temporarily for a few days until we

432
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,200
understood how things were moving and

433
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
what we could open back again for

434
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,880
example we had to close the remote

435
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,080
desktops and all forms of

436
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,880
remote assistance like teamviewer and

437
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,400
stuff like that they were very

438
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,160
understanding because they knew we were

439
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,080
doing it for their own good so it was

440
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,480
very good to have their trust

441
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,559
last but not least

442
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,679
well enterprise grade backups they do

443
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,720
cost a lot but greatly limited the

444
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,960
damage it was just a matter of time to

445
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,720
restore backups a lot of data but data

446
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,200
was there

447
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,520
so

448
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,240
what we will do to prevent further

449
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,720
attacks

450
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,520
well we think we need to develop a sixth

451
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,240
sense for an anomalies in the user

452
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,640
activities that are traced

453
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,000
in the logs

454
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,280
maybe artificial intelligence will come

455
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,720
to the rescue

456
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,919
but still

457
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,640
but in the time being we need to do it

458
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,400
as humans

459
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,039
we need to reevaluate the importance of

460
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,160
existing alerts because some of them

461
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,840
were probably

462
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,480
ignored or we didn't give them enough

463
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,360
importance and we might have

464
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,400
uh stopped the attack if we were right

465
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,280
on that spot we will ingest more logs

466
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,200
that are available but we're not

467
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,400
producing alerts not yet and we are in

468
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,480
the fine section in the

469
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,880
fine tuning of them because they're just

470
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,080
producing too much alerts to be useful

471
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,640
and something we would like to do is

472
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,039
some red and blue team training and

473
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,640
activities

474
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,559
because there are many free resources

475
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,160
online it really helps even newcomers to

476
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,960
get

477
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,160
into the infrastructure to get into new

478
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,520
technologies even if they see it uh in a

479
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,080
training quickly but when you then when

480
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,159
you need it you just know

481
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,559
that you can do it that was the case for

482
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,960
myself that i was thrown into an elastic

483
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,720
search instance

484
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,600
that i had seen just in uh maybe 10

485
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,480
minutes one year before

486
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,880
finally define which open source

487
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,240
intelligence sources we should monitor

488
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,559
twitter is full of it but we need to

489
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,039
focus on some of them otherwise you lose

490
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,960
track of the information and

491
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,039
it really takes a lot of time

492
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,840
and adopt also some closing sources

493
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,240
because we later discovered that from a

494
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,280
closing source we would have known that

495
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,600
those credentials were on sale on the

496
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,120
dark web

497
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,640
thank you for your attention if you have

498
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,720
any questions you you can reach them you

499
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,880
can reach us by email

500
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,280
and good luck
