members and like dear participants

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,559
from all across the world

30
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,760
this is a deeply sad moment for me and

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,199
for our members and the global community

32
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,720
we have

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,040
colleagues who are directly affected we

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,920
have friends or family in eastern europe

35
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,520
and we feel

36
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,960
deep empathy for those affected

37
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,960
the board of directors condemns the

38
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
attack that is happening in the ukraine

39
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,360
and we are horrified by the

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,840
violent violation of international law

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,720
i think we are a global community tied

42
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,040
together by by a shared mission and

43
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,320
motivation

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,400
um to bring together instant response

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,479
teams and security teams from from every

46
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,520
country

47
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,759
across the world to to ensure a safe

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,759
internet for all

49
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,240
um but we also tied together as as

50
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,159
citizens of the world

51
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,520
um so our role is to to provide instant

52
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,720
responders a worldwide

53
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,320
contact to the right teams and

54
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,840
information

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,479
achieve a common understanding and also

56
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,079
help technical and non-technical

57
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,600

and all of this becomes even more

61
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,840
important

62
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,720

uh also we from tft third has a

86
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,280
statement to the actual situation

87
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,440
we all were all shocked when we heard

88
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,959
about the news about the russian

89
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,360
military invasion at the ukraine a week

90
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,400
ago

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,000
um most

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,920
of us know that there was an armed

93
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,440
conflict in the eastern border of

94
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,640
ukraine

95
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,720
um but we could not imagine that there

96
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,200
would be a war in the middle of europe

97
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,840
in this

98
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,360
century uh we

99
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,760
as individuals as well as the syrian

100
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,560
committee of tfc cert condemned the war

101
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
on ukraine

102
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,840
in principle

103
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,159
uh we at tfc cert have a process to

104
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,519
address team misconduct to a desperate

105
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,799
solution dispute resolution process

106
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,439
and to request sanctions

107
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,000
in the present case we have a breach of

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,720
trust not by the teams but by the

109
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,280
controlling authority of the teams

110
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,280
therefore at the request of members

111
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,319
in this extraordinary situation

112
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,360
we have taken an extraordinary decision

113
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,720
to temporarily suspend the membership

114
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,759
of the two teams russian cert and search

115
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,880
by until the situation returns to normal

116
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,759
i would like to note that we also

117
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,560
condemn not only the physical

118
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,840
attacks but also virtual ones regardless

119
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,759
of which part in a conflict they came

120
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,720
from

121
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,160
and with this

122
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,960
um

123
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,720
we hope that you understand our position

124
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,479
