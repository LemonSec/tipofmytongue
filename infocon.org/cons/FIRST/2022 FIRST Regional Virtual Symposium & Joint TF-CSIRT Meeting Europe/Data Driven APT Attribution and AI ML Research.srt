1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,359
[Music]

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,040
so as you say euro control is a

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,040
pan-european organization composed of

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,400
forty-one plus two member states

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,120
including francophone israel and ukraine

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,280
so you can think that the the current

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,359
situation is quite uh

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,359
i would say dense and

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,840
i would say uh boring for us

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,600
we're on the front line to implement the

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,400
sanctions taken by the states due to

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,880
related to aviation so here we are going

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,039
to speak about something that

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,600
is uh i would say important to us which

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,079
is how to improve the ability to

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,239
attribute a server attack to an ap so um

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,879
i would do that together with a bachelor

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,040
with

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,960
next slide please

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,960
so the objective is really to

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,440
uh i would say improve the way we can

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,840
attribute an attack you know that

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,520
aviation is a critical infrastructure as

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,239
well as a big kind of strategic threats

25
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,600
meaning

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,640
quite often quite well identified apts

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,600
and what we are concerned is the fact

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,600
that it's not an obsession attribution

29
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,320
but

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,159
it's part of one element that could help

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,080
us to better understand who is behind

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,000
and therefore who could earth could be a

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,920
target and also what could be the

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,439
motivation and therefore the the

35
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,159
likelihood of other potential

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,000
cyber attacks so we'll develop a

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,400
two-step approach that barcelona will

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,240
describe into more detail which is based

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,640
on a kind of uh author static approach

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,479
on the software which is mechanically

41
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,960
finally so considering the the mighty

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,119
attack ttps we are quite fond of mitral

43
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,600
attack at the euro controller

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,240
we hosted an original event and we are

45
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,799
working a lot on it promoting it

46
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,040
so this tool is kind of mechanically

47
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,040
seeing based on the number of ttp this

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,720
is the likelihood that

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,280
a certain apt is behind but we find that

50
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,520
this was not necessary and we are about

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,560
to develop

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,200
an aiml application to use the context

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,079
and therefore to refine the the

54
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,079
the potential attribution of cyber

55
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,079
attack to apg and you will see that for

56
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,320
that we need your cooperation therefore

57
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,199
we will um uh ask you to help us for

58
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,280
that in a kind of innovative way which

59
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,599
is not traditional in ai where usually

60
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,040
you share the data to train the model

61
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,040
but more to share the model because the

62
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,599
data can be trained can be shared and

63
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,680
more than that we don't want to to get

64
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,959
those data being shared it would be a

65
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,280
nightmare to hand over to bhartiya we'll

66
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,280
describe that into more detail and i

67
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,480
will take

68
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,000
the confidence light over to you but

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,400
thank you

70
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,360
my name is bhatia mustafa i am also a

71
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,920
t part part of the atm short team

72
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,400
i hope you can see my

73
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,360
correct screen

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,519
if not please tell me perfect that's

75
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,640
perfect

76
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,760
okay

77
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,640
so

78
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,040
as patrick explained the we are trying

79
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,319
to

80
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,519
create some

81
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,000
tool or techniques to better attribute

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,280
the

83
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,599
one of the problems in cyber security is

84
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,680
attribution i'll talk about it in

85
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,760
details and

86
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,480
we created a two-step approach we first

87
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,280
created the tool that's called fit

88
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,680
advisor

89
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,840
adversary finder

90
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,560
which utilizes mitra attack framework

91
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,879
database and

92
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,879
creates an estimation

93
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,120
for apt group and then

94
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,400
we move to

95
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,519
ml

96
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,440
and machine learning approach

97
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,440
as you all know uh

98
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,000
one of the popular topics or of the

99
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,599
important things is the apt groups

100
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,720
there are many different apt groups with

101
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,080
fancy names

102
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,360
let's say like cozy beer star stardust

103
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,319
colima helix kitten

104
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,840
etc there are different naming con

105
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,040
conventions from different vendors

106
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,879
someone is using

107
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,280
animal names like crowdstrike someone is

108
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,080
using a numbering

109
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,840
some are using some other naming

110
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,840
conversions but just to give you an idea

111
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,439
this is the naming convention from

112
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,000
crowdstrike

113
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,880
[Music]

114
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,759
and the different animal names actually

115
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,880
point

116
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,800
to a different

117
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,199
regions let's say or

118
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,720
nation states

119
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,080
for example if there is a kitten in the

120
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,440
name

121
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,040
probably it is a

122
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,000
iranian apt group it is either

123
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,800
affiliated with a nation-state or a

124
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,199
criminal group that is sponsored or

125
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,960
supported by

126
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,880
iranian state

127
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
if you see a beer

128
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,080
which is popular nowadays it means that

129
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,160
it is probably

130
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,400
a group that is affiliated or supported

131
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,440
by a russian federation

132
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,680
uh just to give you an idea one of the

133
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,280
popular groups nowadays is

134
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,840
apt-29

135
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,880
or

136
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,759
known as also cosbir

137
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,919
as i say

138
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:12,960
different

139
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,880
vendors are using different naming

140
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,080
conversions but the idea is to address

141
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,520
to a certain group that is targeting

142
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,840
other nations or other sectors

143
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,800
for example if you look at the apt-29 or

144
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,280
kosibir this is the

145
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,639
mitra attack

146
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,560
information page for apt-29 you can see

147
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,120
the link below so if you want to look at

148
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,479
the more detail you can see at the mitre

149
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,080
website here you can see

150
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,199
the associated groups or known different

151
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,320
names

152
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,840
also

153
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,880
some other

154
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,639
information

155
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,280
in details we also see the different

156
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,479
tools and techniques that are used by

157
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,960
this group

158
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,240
these

159
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,720
ttps are formed by different vendors

160
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,840
over the years by observing their attack

161
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,280
techniques

162
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,400
observing their behaviors and is built a

163
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,720
model for every apt

164
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,039
and also they are using a different

165
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,280
software some of them is commercial some

166
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,280
of them is their

167
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,520
own developed software

168
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,400
for example uh some of apt groups are

169
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,560
using a cobble strike which is

170
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,639
actually a commercial tool that is also

171
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,360
used for a penetration testing or

172
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,759
red teaming activities

173
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,440
so the idea is every apt group is

174
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,639
having a

175
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,639
model that includes a ttps or

176
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,560
software that it is use using

177
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,560
and

178
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,440
this is the mitra attack framing model

179
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,840
for

180
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,599
apt-29 ttps tools techniques and

181
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,560
procedures the boxes that are marked in

182
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,639
blue are

183
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,680
actual

184
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,759
ttps that are used by

185
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,440
apt-29 in every step of their

186
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,080
attack chain

187
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,719
so

188
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,319
how we can use that information for

189
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,280
attribution it is not easy and this is

190
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,039
the problem actually that we are trying

191
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,759
to solve

192
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,160
the main idea is

193
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,280
by

194
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,400
observing a data or observing

195
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,039
ttps

196
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,440
from attacks that are extracted from

197
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,240
attacks targeting our organization

198
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,599
like extracting firewall logs ips etc

199
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,599
to build a model and estimate

200
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,319
what is the group

201
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,000
apt group behind these attacks

202
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,120
of course

203
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,800
in an internet world it is not

204
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,319
possible to

205
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,120
be a hundred percent sure

206
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,560
because there are many evasion

207
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,039
techniques like using a

208
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,599
fake ip addresses using a different

209
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,759
keyboard layout

210
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,680
etc but

211
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,919
our tool is help to esti to help you

212
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,520
estimate

213
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,879
as i say it's not possible to 100

214
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,280
percent

215
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,320
and if you are able to

216
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,479
predict or estimate the apt group it

217
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,240
will help to

218
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,159
better prepare us in defense

219
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,560
side let's say and it will help us to

220
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,720
build a tactical operational or

221
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,880
strategic defense

222
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,920
strategies let's say

223
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,200
of course

224
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,120
this is also helpful to

225
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,360
separate uh apt activities from other uh

226
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,200
criminal groups let's say because uh in

227
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,720
uh

228
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,160
current uh

229
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,839
current status

230
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,959
we see a lot of communication about the

231
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,600
apt groups or underground groups that

232
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,959
are uh

233
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,200
either against or

234
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,680
with some of the states with russia or

235
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,959
the ukraine

236
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,920
but we if we are not able to correctly

237
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,880
estimate or predict what is the attacker

238
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,480
maybe uh

239
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,399
the attacks that we are observing to our

240
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,959
infrastructure is not from apt groups

241
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,080
but maybe

242
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,760
it is from uh some opportunistic

243
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,600
hacker that wants to benefit from the

244
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,399
current climate and

245
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,519
get some benefits let's say

246
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,800
so this is the main idea behind

247
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,360
our work and

248
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,519
first

249
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,800
we try to

250
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,199
estimate the apt by looking the

251
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,120
tools techniques and procedures that we

252
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,160
observe

253
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,200
and

254
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,920
as i say it's not easy just by looking

255
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,880
at

256
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,399
this list

257
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,880
to estimate and say to answer the

258
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,200
question uh what is this group

259
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,000
and

260
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,920
to make it worse

261
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,600
if we have a partial information let's

262
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,480
say

263
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,399
some of the ttps are missing

264
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,200
the

265
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,680
answer is

266
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,519
harder so we cannot easily estimate

267
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,079
and as a solution

268
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,959
we propose a two-step approach with the

269
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,880
data-driven apt attribution

270
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,240
it should be based on

271
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,399
attacks that we observe to our

272
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,320
infrastructure at the first step we

273
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,200
developed a tool that is called a fit

274
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,320
adversary finder tool let's say

275
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,920
it's a free tool uh that was first

276
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,200
developed internally by atm sort it uses

277
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,000
the apt groups database from mitra

278
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,240
attack it uses the latest ultra attack

279
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,640
framework and latest

280
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,279
apt database

281
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,000
just to show how the mitre attack is

282
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,120
used because uh microattack framework is

283
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,320
very

284
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
important framework but

285
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,920
it's not easy to

286
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,279
use it let's say

287
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,519
and

288
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,040
just to give you an idea

289
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,160
the main purpose of the tool is to

290
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,279
build a list of the ttps like this one

291
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,920
and using this one to have some sort of

292
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,200
estimation to some degree and say that

293
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,880
with these

294
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,440
ttps

295
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,760
we can estimate that these are the

296
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,920
possible groups that are attacking

297
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,320
our organization

298
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,040
i will show you some screenshots of our

299
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,680
tool so we start with the blank tool

300
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,040
it's not very

301
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,880
fancy let's say it's just a desktop

302
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,440
application

303
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,040
coded in python uh the gui and the

304
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,240
background it uses some neo4j for

305
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,920
relationship building

306
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,800
first we start with inputting

307
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,920
ttps by id or by name

308
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,000
so

309
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,680
we

310
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,560
just put a list it can be imported from

311
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,160
text file or

312
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,800
it can be put one by one

313
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,560
either by id

314
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,600
from a vital attack framework or

315
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,200
by name

316
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,399
and once the list is built

317
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,760
using my

318
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,880
apt database we create the

319
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,160
estimations let's say so if you have

320
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,079
11

321
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,880
ttps

322
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,200
here we see the estimation of three

323
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,040
possible uh with the highest possibility

324
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,279
these are these are the most possible

325
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,480
apt groups

326
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,880
apd2 chimera and oil rig because

327
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,720
uh from these 11 ttps that we input uh

328
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,760
four of them matches to uh

329
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,600
the profile of this ept group so with 36

330
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,800
percent

331
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,079
confidence

332
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,360
we can say these are the possible groups

333
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,519
as i say it's not possible to say 100

334
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,760
percent this is the group

335
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,279
unless you're

336
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,240
you have some other intelligence

337
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,959
but the more data we put in that tool

338
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,000
the more ttps we put in the tool the

339
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,320
estimation ratio increases as you can

340
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,800
imagine

341
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,480
and

342
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,880
once the estimation is built we can get

343
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,800
some more information about

344
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,680
the

345
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,360
estimated groups

346
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,079
for example we can get some more details

347
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,959
which ttps are matching

348
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,079
to this profile

349
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,440
also

350
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,519
we can go directly to the mighty attack

351
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,399
framework

352
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,120
website that is explaining and

353
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,800
containing all the information about

354
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,639
this threat group

355
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,320
also we can build a relationship

356
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,480
schema

357
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,880
here we see the relationship with the

358
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,920
other uh related apt groups

359
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,480
uh here for example this apt group is

360
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,199
related with uh emission panda

361
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,000
uh bronze union apt-29

362
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,279
island tiger etc also we can build a

363
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,959
relationship with all the ttps that this

364
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,959
threat group is using so

365
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,000
it can help us visually to

366
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,800
see what is possible what are the

367
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,120
next possible attacks

368
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,160
if this is the real group

369
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,120
behind the attacks

370
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,920
also we can this can help us in a

371
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,800
defense side in mitigations so

372
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,920
once we

373
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,920
input a list of the

374
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,240
ttps

375
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,519
we can build

376
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,279
mitigations this is also a cross

377
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,480
reference from a micro attack framework

378
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,880
and basically looking at

379
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,199
this table we can

380
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,760
prioritize our defenses because

381
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,920
these are the mitigation mitigations

382
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,040
that are

383
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,480
specifically mentioned in these attack

384
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,959
techniques

385
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,000
another

386
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,120
feature is building a relationship

387
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,560
map using

388
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,920
neo4j database and features

389
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,120
so basically the

390
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,320
list of the ttps it creates

391
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,519
a map the orange one are apt groups and

392
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,519
the blue one are

393
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,440
tools techniques and procedures that are

394
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,600
utilized in

395
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,199
our attack

396
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,720
so

397
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,440
this is the tool

398
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,759
it is currently working as i say is a

399
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,199
desktop application it's a free tool

400
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,600
if you want to use it just

401
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,759
drop an email

402
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,519
in next days we are planning to also put

403
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,040
it in our

404
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,240
github

405
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,079
page

406
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,519
and you can use it no need to share any

407
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,639
data with us but if you want to

408
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,440
uh

409
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,680
contribute to the code or to the quality

410
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,560
you can

411
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,279
report us any

412
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,199
bugs

413
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,360
so this is the first step

414
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,519
the second step is using a machine

415
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,800
learning

416
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,759
to improve uh contribution

417
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,160
attribution

418
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,839
so the basic idea is

419
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,839
to develop a machine learning

420
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,800
application that is constantly scanning

421
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,519
a free text or intelligence report that

422
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,720
may not include a list of ttps

423
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,360
and from that intelligence report or

424
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,079
that free text extract

425
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,280
ttps built a list of data structure it

426
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,319
and then

427
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,039
again build the estimation model for

428
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,199
context and for

429
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,160
apt groups

430
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,359
uh

431
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,839
as patrick indicated we

432
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,839
we are very

433
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,000
focused on

434
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,480
collaboration and for that purpose we

435
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,720
also

436
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,760
investigating possible collaborations

437
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,640
without sharing the data uh one of the

438
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,480
examples uh is a feder project which is

439
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,799
developed by scale out systems and its

440
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,880
open source project

441
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
in that project

442
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,960
uh every participant has its own data

443
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,600
and its own machine learning application

444
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,320
and

445
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,559
once you create a machine learning

446
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,000
models

447
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,640
only the models are shared with each

448
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,480
which each other

449
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,080
and you don't have to

450
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,000
share your data

451
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,520
which is

452
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,679
obviously not very easy in cyber

453
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,280
security

454
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,120
there are two different models

455
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,559
the first one

456
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,039
the frozen mod

457
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,760
you just consume

458
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,520
you connect the

459
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,039
sharing model server

460
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,720
download the module

461
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,679
and

462
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,240
run it locally in your

463
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,280
organization and

464
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,720
then

465
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,320
use your data to

466
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,640
enrich and detect some patterns inside

467
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,760
your data

468
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,679
this is the first mod the second one is

469
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,559
enriching mode in that mode you again

470
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,280
call connect to the server download the

471
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,280
machine learning models

472
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,320
uh train using your own data

473
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,760
and uh

474
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,520
if you're using your data the model is

475
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,240
enriched or enhanced

476
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,280
then

477
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,120
you you can share that enriched model or

478
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,600
improve the model on the server so

479
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,840
everyone can benefit

480
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,880
from

481
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,679
the enrichment on your site without

482
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,559
sharing the data

483
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,039
so

484
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,960
this is an example of the application we

485
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,960
are still working on it we just started

486
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,200
the the idea is if you have such an

487
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,360
intelligence report from

488
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,760
commercial cti members or from our

489
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,919
internal teams

490
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,440
using that application it will

491
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,120
automatically

492
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,880
detect the ttps like fishing

493
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,280
the spear phishing attachment the power

494
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,520
shell

495
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,840
domain fronting and usage of the

496
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,039
specific software for attack mode and

497
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,919
the context what is the target region or

498
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,160
what's the target country

499
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,880
also what is the timing information

500
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,440
is it related to some

501
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,360
events that are happening at a certain

502
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,960
point of time

503
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
or a certain region

504
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,240
so this is the idea to automatically

505
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,559
extract the information from free text

506
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,820
and

507
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,200
[Music]

508
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,919
structure it and then estimate

509
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,080
what are the attacking groups or what's

510
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,360
the apt

511
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,479
behind that attacks

512
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,320
so

513
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,840
this is a call for

514
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,919
cooperation i try to say in other slides

515
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,360
but again

516
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,159
both in a fit tool and a ml application

517
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,240
we can collaborate without sharing the

518
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,640
data

519
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,880
and if you want you can participate and

520
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,559
enrich that activities

521
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,000
so i hand over to patrick

522
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,679
yes so thank you

523
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,120
so i think for us what is really

524
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,600
important as you can see is that

525
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,039
um we are

526
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,360
interested in in your cooperation for

527
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,000
the benefit of the community in order to

528
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,640
share the most

529
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,799
image and are insisting on this notion

530
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,320
of federated learning which is for us

531
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,919
the only way to provide to proceed i

532
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,919
mean it's impossible to get the data

533
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,159
being shared we don't it's not possible

534
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,840
that we don't want so that's really

535
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,760
important for us to to to have this

536
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,799
approach

537
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,880
with your successful with your

538
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,200
contribution meaning that you can enrich

539
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,120
on your own data set you know there are

540
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,360
two aspects in machine learning the

541
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,080
training is really a dedicated uh

542
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,200
quite touchy uh i would say a step

543
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,880
you need a lot of documents on which you

544
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,720
have already i would say good confidence

545
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,320
that with kind of ttps you have

546
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,520
attributed

547
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,440
to a certain group and so that that

548
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,520
would be the way to enrich

549
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,159
the model and the broader i would say

550
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,360
that the participant the the better the

551
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,280
model the more performance

552
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,360
the model because it would based on

553
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,600
various types of cyber attack various

554
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,159
groups so we see a benefit

555
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,000
into that and again euro control we're

556
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,840
not a commercial entity we have an

557
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,320
european international intergovernmental

558
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,480
organization therefore we will share the

559
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,760
outcome of that

560
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,000
free of charge is for the benefit of the

561
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,799
community so it's um

562
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,720
i would say something for us that is

563
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,679
aiming at supporting aviation and

564
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,039
beyond aviation

565
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,880
the community so it's a call for

566
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,000
cooperation

567
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,159
thank you very much and uh i don't know

568
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,600
if we have time for all questions

569
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,600
up to you over to you thank you very

570
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,080
much
