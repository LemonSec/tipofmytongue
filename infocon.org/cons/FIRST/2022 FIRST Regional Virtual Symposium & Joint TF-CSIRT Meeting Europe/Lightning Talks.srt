00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,040
without further ado i would like to

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,559
introduce you

4

to easter caesar

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,440
um

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,200
if by any chance you're wondering what

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,199
the name of our company as well as the

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,760
name of our team means uh here we go

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,960
istros

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,359
is the ancient greek name for the river

and as we are based in bratislava

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,880
slovakia the river is a symbol that we

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,359
chose as the base of our name

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,399
so quite simple

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,760

in operating systems

93
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,080
it and ot systems currently we have 10

quite big

111
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,560
we had multiple instant responses on

112
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,880
cyber defense engagements we performed

113
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,120

uh most of you know very well uh oops

152
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,000
too many slides there sorry most of you

153
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,479
know very well what cbe

154
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,360
is uh and that our program's mission is

155
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,560
to

156
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,680
catalog cyber security vulnerabilities

157
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,319
i don't know if everyone knows very well

158
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,919
that cve

159
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,440
is a very international community and

160
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,319
that we um

161
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,160
are not mitre

162
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,440
mitre is the secretariat of cve

163
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,880
uh and we do receive sponsorship from

164
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,440
homeland security in the united states

165
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,600
but we are

166
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,400
driven by community driven by membership

167
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,120
decisions made by the board

168
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
and we want

169
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,280
greater global participation and we want

170
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,360
to enable greater global participation

171
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,319
of course we do allow people to

172
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,360
be able to refer to a vulnerability and

173
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,759
know that they're talking about

174
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,440
the same thing

175
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,400
so cbe is to give us a language and a

176
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,758
tool to talk about it

177
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,720
community um again we

178
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,360
gosh sorry touchy thing again we are a

179
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,479
community

180
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,120
driven program uh we rely on the

181
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,599
community vendors end users uh

182
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,840
vulnerability researchers

183
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,639
um cbes are assigned by the cbe

184
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,560
numbering authorities which are

185
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,960
sometimes the software vendor but are

186
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,840
sometimes a bug bounty sometimes

187
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,280
individual researchers sometimes

188
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,720
a country cert so cnas

189
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,000
drive the assignment the cbe board again

190
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,120
provides the direction of the program

191
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,199
and the board does consist of industry

192
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,360
professionals academics government

193
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,960
representatives

194
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,400
persons from around the world

195
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,800
the working groups develop the program's

196
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,120
policies uh which again are approved by

197
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
the board and

198
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,199
many of the working groups some are only

199
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,080
open to the cna membership and some are

200
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,560
open to the general community

201
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,160
my own working group the outreach

202
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,000
working group is one of those open to

203
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,120
the general community

204
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,599
uh so again i think you know very well

205
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,680
you know what is a cve

206
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,080
um but this is

207
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,759
the information that we're trying to

208
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,240
provide and the language that we're that

209
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,520
we're trying to um keep everyone you

210
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,479
know on the same page so that we do have

211
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,479
greater means to talk about critical

212
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,520
vulnerabilities right

213
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,319
um so

214
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,958
how does it work again i think this

215
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,760
group knows very well a discoverer a

216
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,159
researcher discovers a new vulnerability

217
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,799
they report it to

218
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,919
a cve program participant to the vendor

219
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,720
to the cna what have you uh

220
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,480
they requested a cbe identifier the cbe

221
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,440
id is now reserved um

222
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,320
the cve program participant submits the

223
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,160
details and we publish um and these are

224
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,600
republished around the world of course

225
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,440
so what's a cna

226
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,839
and this is really my pitch if you will

227
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,880
is a greater cna engagement and i think

228
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,080
many of you may be cnas already some of

229
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,440
you are not

230
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,519
but what's a cna an organization

231
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,080
responsible for the assignment of cbe

232
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,680
ids again this may be a software vendor

233
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,959
maybe an open source project maybe a

234
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,519
country coordination center could be a

235
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,920
bug bounty could be a research

236
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,480
organization could be a hosted service

237
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
i think um

238
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,080
when you become a cna you demonstrate uh

239
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,800
mature vulnerability uh management

240
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
processes and practices

241
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,720
you communicate value-added

242
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,800
vulnerability information

243
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,880
you control your message

244
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,880
about vulnerabilities within your scope

245
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,120
you can assign a cde id without having

246
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,079
to share embargoed information

247
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,160
you can share information more broadly

248
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,279
to protect systems against attacks

249
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,000
and you have the opportunity to exchange

250
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,800
ideas in partnership with other cna

251
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,959
organizations which is the community

252
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,040
aspect right

253
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
i think sometimes people think the bar

254
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,440
for becoming a cna must be

255
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,200
uh very high

256
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,519
um and sometimes organizations think oh

257
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,720
i'm i'm not ready for that uh but really

258
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,680
uh the bar is quite simple and we're

259
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,560
here

260
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,160
as a community to help promote

261
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,680
enablement

262
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,920
have a public vulnerability disclosure

263
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,040
policy

264
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,959
have a public source

265
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,519
for new vulnerability disclosures and

266
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,560
agree to the cve terms of use

267
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,519
there is no monetary requirement there's

268
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,640
no contract you have to sign and cnas

269
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,959
volunteer their own time for their own

270
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,440
benefit

271
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,240
so to become a cna you would contact the

272
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,640
cve program you'd complete the

273
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,120
registration form agree to the terms of

274
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,640
use attend an introductory session again

275
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,360
we are about enablement of participation

276
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,920
we do have videos online um available at

277
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,760
all hours uh to assist with enablement

278
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,120
um

279
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,880
successfully complete with us some

280
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,519
practice examples so we can

281
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,279
ensure that everybody

282
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,839
is on the same page

283
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,839
i had an organization recently that was

284
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,760
like oh gosh there's a test it's really

285
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,040
quite simple

286
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,959
um and again you know we're here to help

287
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,970

many businesses from i.t we we represent

308
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,320
department the uh

310
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,639
cyber security part as you can see in

311
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,040
the numbers

312
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,480
many impressive

313

what we are really proud of is the fact

315
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,959
that we have over 6k

316
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,760
uh plus security professionals just

317
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,040
oriented on many aspects of

318
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,279
cyber security

319
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,480
our ambition is to to grow to to be

320
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,279
the

321
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,079
the the leader in the cyber security

322
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,160
uh to support our customer with this

323
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,399
competence with this with the skills

324
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,600
that our people presents on technology

325
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,480
and on

326
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,519
on

327
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,760
um on skillset professional competences

328
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,440
aspects

329
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,240
but

330
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,959
we are also here because we are c-series

331
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,279
we are third so at a third

332
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,040
um

333
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,839
it means that we have over 20 customers

search members of

336
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,279
roughly uh of

337
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,560
roughly around 200 incidents per year

338
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,160
protest

339
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,000
from less severe to

340
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,040
to the criticals but the not only

341
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,360
numbers

342
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,600
or caesar

343
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,880
answer cert

344
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,959
combines from

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,160
combines of incident response of digital

347
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,800
forensics and malware analysis the core

348
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,959
um the core of uh scissors team uh we

349
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,839
have also products uh c cert uh we have

350
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,920
pretty intelligence threat hunting and

351
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,560
vulnerability management like we said

352
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,240
yesterday that's the part of the blue

353
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,720
team on the on the on the right side on

354
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,519
the

355
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,800
on the red team on the dark side of

356
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,639
energy we have our red team who

357
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,720
constantly uh constantly um stimulate us

358
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,560
to improve ourselves

359
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,440
uh and yeah we have worldwide presence

360
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,720
in terms of

361
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,399
having customers

362
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,000
international on many uh on

363
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,040
on each continent but also

364
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,639
worldwide presence it means that we have

365
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,360
global scissors but we have also local

366
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,680
presence of our teachers to support

367
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,720
local

368
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,880
needs of our customers

369
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,040
and that's it we are really really

370
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,920
honored to to be here to to be part of

371
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,880
the first and really enjoy

372
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,680
uh and looking forward to support this

373
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,279
this community

374
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,000
uh again like we emphasized yesterday

375
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,600
stronger together

376
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,839
uh here's the contact uh

377
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,880
to us

378
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,480
so any questions any uh any needs to

379
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,720
contact go ahead we are well you are

380
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,079
well to welcome more than welcome to

381
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,600
to to discuss with us

382
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
that's all from my side

383
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,320
so now you can see my slides so i will

384
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,199
present our malware analysis sharing

385
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,480
platform which we developed at ccmu in

386
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,560
the safana horizon 2020 project

387
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,519
and to jump right in i will start

388
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,440
to describe how the process works

389
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,720
so at start our goal is to

390
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,240
evaluate whether a suspicious fire is

391
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,920
malicious or not

392
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,880
and to help so with this uh our

393
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,839
architecture offers a uh web ui

394
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,320
where the analysts uploads the

395
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,839
suspicious file

396
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,560
and uh from this point everything is

397
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,399
automated so the

398
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,920
file is resistantly stored in s3 uh data

399
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,120
storage

400
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,759
which is continuously monitored by

401
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,160
apache airflow process

402
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,079
which monitors the s3 buckets for any

403
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,079
new files and revenue sample is found it

404
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,079
sends it to the observable evaluator

405
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,040
which is a tool that we developed to

406
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,880
evaluate the files

407
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,120
it utilizes uh intel hour platform

408
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,399
which sends the file to multiple

409
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,079
third-party tools

410
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,959
you can see examples of the tools at the

411
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,279
right site on the pictures

412
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,880
i think everybody here knows wires total

413
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,560
hybrid analysis alien vault who takes

414
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,639
and many others

415
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,440
and uh just martin just i'm only seeing

416
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,600
i'm seeing like the presenters view i'm

417
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,279
not seeing i've only seen you know it's

418
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,760
only on the first slide at the moment

419
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,959
oh sorry

420
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,720
so maybe uh like this

421
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,240
yeah well i'm seeing the architecture

422
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,319
now yes yeah

423
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,520
so

424
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,520
yeah this is the uh web ui s3 database

425
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,079
apache airflow server evaluator intel

426
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,679
hour uh

427
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,039
everything is automated so uh the file

428
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,919
uh goes to the third party tools which

429
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,320
returns a report

430
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,559
uh whether the file is malicious or not

431
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,280
and also returns

432
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,799
ioc indicators of compromise which means

433
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,919
we can check the ip addresses or

434
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,559
domain names with which the sample

435
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,840
communicates

436
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,679
and for each ioc we recursively run the

437
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,200
analysis through those

438
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,320
third party tools to evaluate the

439
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,240
iocs as well

440
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,960
when all of this is done we return the

441
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,360
results to apache airflow

442
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,799
which prepares a pdf report back to the

443
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,240
human analysts and also prepares the

444
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,440
same data to the miss sharing platform

445
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,760
so that it could be shared with other

446
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,200
teams

447
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
the last step is

448
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,840
the mitigation of malicious iocs where

449
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,000
we have prepared api

450
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,440
uh to

451
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,760
automatically block the malicious ip

452
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,559
addresses or domains

453
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,679
now so for development we have prepared

454
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,520
everything in okra so that it could be

455
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,559
deployed using one command

456
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,840
the only thing that we have to provide

457
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,760
is the api keys

458
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,559
for the thread party tools because they

459
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,840
require

460
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,679
you to have a

461
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,480
user account even though it's free you

462
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,840
need to provide this api

463
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,080
so to take a look at how this works

464
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,480
at first the apache airflow monitors

465
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,400
everything

466
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,200
yeah then the analysts submits the

467
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,080
suspicious file into the ui just a

468
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,559
simple webpage

469
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,640
then the analysis uh process starts so

470
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,840
you can see

471
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,880
the guts of apache airflow

472
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,640
and when everything is done inside

473
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,480
the analysts can download the created

474
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,520
report

475
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,320
uh which contains the final result

476
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,200
whether the file is malicious or not it

477
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,960
provides the hashes all known variants

478
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,840
and

479
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,880
which of the third party tools dictators

480
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,360
malicious and which tools

481
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,200
didn't

482
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,000
in the next page of the pdf report the

483
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,559
analysts can look at the

484
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,039
indicators of compromise so we can see

485
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,400
our sample malware communicates with

486
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,280
four ip addresses uh three of them are

487
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,039
attacked by

488
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,320
uh

489
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,000
alien world as malicious one is not

490
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,840
and the same data in miss

491
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,440
so uh that was my uh short intro of the

492
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,960
platform

493
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,919
uh

494
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,400
currently uh it's a work in progress in

495
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,720
the uh support project which will end in

496
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,840
a trail so at the end of the project in

497
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,480
about one month we will release this as

498
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,320
open source on github

499
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,880
so it will be available for everybody uh

500
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,960
so far if you are interested just send

501
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,960
us an email and we will provide you

502
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,559
access

503
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,960
thank you

504
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,880
ladies and gentlemen it's great to be

505
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,240
here with you great to see you all again

506
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,559
hopefully you will see each other soon

507
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,559
in person

508
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,039
what i have for you today are ten slides

509
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,840
for five minutes about to look for shell

510
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,039
before i jump in a bit of context

511
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,760
up until the end of january i used to

512
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,679
lead an incident response team at olive

513
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,360
a mid-european organization that

514
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,440
basically offers services related to

515
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,120
cyber security

516
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,400
before i left the team i took a look at

517
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,080
our captures on ips related to look for

518
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,919
shell and i noticed a couple of

519
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,080
interesting trends that i thought would

520
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,720
be worth it to share with you within the

521
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,880
context of this lightning talk so let's

522
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
jump right in

523
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,600
you probably all know what lock4j is and

524
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,080
look for shelley's but

525
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,280
for

526
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,679
everyone who has been sleeping for the

527
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,039
past year

528
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,960
look 4j

529
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,360
is an incredible logging framework

530
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,400
basically what apache did with it is to

531
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,360
enable us to lock anything in basically

532
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,240
any format to interact with additional

533
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,039
services on the backend after things are

534
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,159
logged

535
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,320
basically you can do anything with it

536
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,679
it's wonderful

537
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,120
unfortunately

538
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,600
all these features come at the cost of

539
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,880
complexity and complexity as we all very

540
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,640
well know can be

541
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,760
fairly

542
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,320
opposed to security

543
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,480
which is where our unfriendly look for

544
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,679
shell or cde 2021 44

545
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:35,039
228 came in

546
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,000
it was

547
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,440
one of those rare vulnerabilities that

548
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,679
are cvss 10.0 currently most of the

549
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,400
critical ones are 9.8 but this was a

550
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,760
pure 10.

551
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,880
as in you basically have to look at a

552
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,039
vulnerable server and you have complete

553
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,039
control over it

554
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,520
this was a problem because the

555
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,320
exploitation was very easy

556
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,679
and

557
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,130
how attackers usually respond to these

558
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,480
[Music]

559
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,679
announcements and to these

560
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,159
vulnerabilities they basically

561
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,240
decided to exploit it as soon as

562
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,880
possible

563
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,280
unfortunately when i say it

564
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,640
as in log4j was widely used

565
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,880
i'm not speaking

566
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,000
in any metaphors i'm not oversimplifying

567
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,280
basically

568
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,760
it meant that hundreds of thousands if

569
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,840
not millions of applications were

570
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,080
vulnerable because of look 4g

571
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,159
vulnerability

572
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,200
google did a fairly interesting search

573
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,320
over maven which is one of the large

574
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,960
java in java package repositories and

575
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,679
they discovered that about eight percent

576
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,559
of all libraries in the repository were

577
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,799
vulnerable were affected by look for

578
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,240
shell

579
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,520
why is this

580
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,120
surprising well

581
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,960
you wouldn't think that so many

582
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,120
libraries and so many applications use

583
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,120
log4j and they don't by themselves but

584
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,240
as we all very well know one library

585
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,480
usually uses other libraries and those

586
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,640
use another libraries and so on and so

587
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,200
forth so as you may see

588
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,360
on the chart in front of you this is

589
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,400
what google came up with actually the

590
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,559
dependency went to the 8th degree

591
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,400
in case of 4j so lots of applications

592
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,840
lots of systems vulnerable and we have a

593
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
cvss 10.0

594
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,960
luckily

595
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,600
as soon as the

596
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,240
exploitation began response began as

597
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,840
well and

598
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,799
soon after the end of last year the

599
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,080
exploitations attempts seemed to taper

600
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,640
off fairly quickly

601
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,200
so that's the basis

602
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,559
that's the background for lot for shell

603
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,279
it was a huge issue

604
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,600
what i want to talk about today fairly

605
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,320
quickly are a couple of lessons learned

606
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,440
that i noticed could be gained from our

607
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,559
ips

608
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,880
or from the pcaps that were captured by

609
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,159
it

610
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,000
looking at ips today we have some

611
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,159
generic rules that we all apply but

612
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,480
perhaps taking a look at exploitation

613
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,520
attempts for lock for shell might

614
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,360
actually give us some indication of

615
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,279
additional rules that we might be able

616
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,400
to deploy to actually protect ourselves

617
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,799
and our constituencies from similar

618
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,919
attacks at least if the attempts at the

619
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,120
exploitations aren't too extreme and if

620
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,679
the attackers are lazy which in this

621
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,240
case they usually were luckily for us

622
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,120
where to start well if you take a look

623
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,960
at the exploit springs which you have

624
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,640
on in front of you

625
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,679
i've taken all of these from our large

626
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,240
pcap for all the time that the

627
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,159
exploitation was ongoing

628
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,039
one feature which i've noticed was that

629
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,000
the attackers whether it be through some

630
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,440
html parameter or through url

631
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,279
they tried to use fairly standard

632
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,960
paths to an exploit or to exploit

633
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,000
carrying

634
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,279
library

635
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,520
log for shell basically enabled them to

636
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,799
through ldap download aji java library

637
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,240
and then run it

638
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,200
so

639
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,880
if we take a look at what we have in

640
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,400
front of us well

641
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,200
there is slash exploit in all of the

642
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,360
uris here

643
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,039
none of us ever had hopefully on any of

644
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,039
our servers any path or any parameter

645
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,840
which uses the word exploit in it if we

646
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,240
do we are in the minority

647
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,279
so why not block any attempts to

648
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,919
actually access slash exploit on our

649
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,039
servers

650
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,840
this would protect us so writing a very

651
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,799
simple snort rule would actually protect

652
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,120
us from this generic attack it wouldn't

653
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,400
have to be

654
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,159
just look for shell it could be anything

655
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:08,960
else

656
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,919
but we don't have to stop there another

657
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,919
very generic example slash base 64.

658
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,240
yes there are examples where you will

659
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,640
have legitimately in an applications

660
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,159
path in a parameter in url

661
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,760
the word base64 but it will be fairly

662
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,440
unusual we can whitelist for those so

663
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,600
if you don't use any such application

664
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,679
blocking any attempt that uses the word

665
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,159
base64 in

666
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,600
a url or in a parameter might make sense

667
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,159
another word that might be interesting

668
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,200
might be bypass i've seen tens of slash

669
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,039
tomcat bypass

670
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,919
the attackers were lazy they took the

671
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,480
default exploit code from some github

672
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,000
repository didn't change a thing just

673
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,120
tried to use it as it was the last thing

674
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,640
i wanted to mention

675
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,440
and it's quite a funny one what the

676
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,200
attackers tried to do

677
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,679
was to actually do an ldap lookup for

678
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,399
their own domain but they pretended

679
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,279
the id address the public ip address of

680
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,919
the vulnerable server or the attacked

681
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,919
server so they would know

682
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,159
immediately whether it was vulnerable or

683
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,799
not this is a technique that

684
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,080
reasonable researchers use as well

685
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,559
but that shouldn't stop us from

686
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,039
actually blocking it attackers use it as

687
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,840
well why not stop them

688
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,240
we could go on but what i wanted to show

689
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,399
by these three examples

690
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,080
we don't like block listing it's

691
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,919
not a good practice we like allow

692
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,360
listing but

693
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,440
if we learn from what for shell

694
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,600
exploitation attempts we can see that

695
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,159
just by setting up couple of very simple

696
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,440
snort or

697
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,240
surrey catarrhals we might actually have

698
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,679
been able to cover quite a large portion

699
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,240
of log for shell exploitation attempts

700
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,480
and perhaps these same

701
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,120
strings or these same rules could help

702
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,039
us in the future as well

703
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,159
i'm sorry if i went a little bit over

704
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,399
time hopefully not very much ladies and

705
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,559
gentlemen thank you for your attention

706
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,960
and i wish you a wonderful rest of the

707
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,720
day i'm crystals and i come from the sun

708
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,399
computer security team and my goal in

709
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,720
the next five minutes is to present the

710
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,559
idea of low effort security breast

711
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,919
center body

712
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,840
based on the correlation of passion dns

713
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,520
data with threat intelligence

714
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,200
the main motivation for providing this

715
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,559
service comes from the fact that

716
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,159
building and operating a fully fled

717
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,760
security base center is extremely

718
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,399
difficult for most users

719
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,240
deploying network monitoring plus threat

720
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,919
intelligence infrastructure is a serious

721
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,720
complex a serious and complex task hence

722
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,480
only a very small fraction of the

723
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,240
research and education

724
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,720
organizations have a production shock at

725
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,720
the moment

726
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,559
it becomes apparent that we have to find

727
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,399
a way to lower this entry barrier

728
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,679
so

729
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,000
what are we doing in this direction so

730
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,679
far we're providing direct support to

731
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,600
mature enough institutions to set up

732
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,120
short platforms and improve their threat

733
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,760
intelligence capabilities

734
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,200
we're also working on providing a

735
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,960
minimalistic soft design to smaller and

736
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,039
less mature institutions that cannot

737
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,799
maintain a fully fled sock at the moment

738
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,120
however both of these points for various

739
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,799
reasons and especially the latter have

740
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,640
been proven to develop have proven

741
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,080
complex to develop and non-trivial

742
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,320
actually considering those pitfalls we

743
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,919
came up with an alternative approach

744
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,080
named video shock

745
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,760
in this approach instead of deploying a

746
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,679
full-fledged sock on every institution

747
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,440
only selected mature ones will be

748
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,679
hosting central stocks while smaller

749
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,519
ones will be only deploying pdf sensors

750
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,960
those fitting sessions will be actually

751
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,039
providing data to the central mature

752
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,039
infrastructures

753
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,799
these data will be then correlated with

754
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,399
thread intelligence producing alerts for

755
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,320
malicious traffic ready to be filtered

756
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,158
and sent to participating institutions

757
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,360
video consists of parts that can be

758
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,960
deployed with multiple approaches and

759
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,440
even in different organizations in fact

760
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,240
in this graph every caller represents an

761
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,000
element a part that can be deployed in a

762
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,679
different organization

763
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,679
so now let's assume the most distributed

764
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,679
scenario among the deployment scenarios

765
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,720
and

766
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,360
describe the pipeline from

767
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,399
pdns data collection to end client

768
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,399
alerting

769
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,799
pds probes are deployed

770
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,960
above the recursive for each

771
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,880
participating lightweight institution

772
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,320
and this is actually the only

773
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,360
requirement i would have for

774
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,720
institutions to participate in the

775
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,559
schema

776
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,399
data is then pushed from these probes to

777
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,399
a pdns infrastructure service where data

778
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,240
preparation and correlation with mis

779
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,039
intelligence takes place

780
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,600
this results in alerts being sent to

781
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,399
central security teams for analysis and

782
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,159
handling

783
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,480
these teams should then filter

784
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,760
the alerts and notify the lightweight uh

785
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,600
relative institutions regarding the

786
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,039
malicious traffic

787
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,399
and the last step is actually the

788
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,679
follow-ups from the lightweight

789
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,679
institutions so the correlation of the

790
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,360
alerts coming from the central security

791
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,600
teams with their return on network

792
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,760
traffic logs

793
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,840
it is important to note at this point

794
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,000
that throughout this pipeline no

795
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,679
personally identifiable information is

796
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:32,640
found

797
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,039
thus we maintain the privacy throughout

798
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,480
the complete data set

799
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,320
and this is actually because we only log

800
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,799
server to server communication and dpns

801
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,640
probes are deployed above the recursive

802
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,880
sense only the addresses of the querying

803
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,919
name servers are logged

804
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,720
however it's important to note that this

805
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,480
is the not the only way to deploy the

806
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,080
stack and we aim for the matching

807
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,240
flexibility and to support alternate

808
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,399
models so as you can see

809
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,720
on the right hand side of this graph

810
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,480
both the infrastructure as well as the

811
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,919
alerting elements can be hosted in the

812
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,760
same institution rendering the alert

813
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,000
filtering before the the actual client

814
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,840
alerts

815
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,440
redundant and finally for the case of

816
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,960
mature enough institutions the whole

817
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,559
stack from pdns problem to client

818
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,919
alerting can be hosted in the same

819
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,559
institution

820
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,039
at the moment we are working on

821
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,519
selecting the appropriate bids probe

822
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,200
as well as designing the correlation

823
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,679
engine between the passive dns data and

824
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,000
the missive indicators

825
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,640
as this is a project in its synthesis if

826
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,919
you want to participate you're more than

827
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,000
welcome and please contact us to the

828
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,480
given address

829
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,559
that is actually all by me i hope i was

830
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,678
in time
