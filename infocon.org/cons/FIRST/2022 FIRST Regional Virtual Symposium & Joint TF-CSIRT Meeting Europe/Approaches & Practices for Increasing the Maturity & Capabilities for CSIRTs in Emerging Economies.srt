i thank you for the opportunity

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,960
all to

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,040
given to us to present this research

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,320
report

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,639
the two-part report is

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,440
a living document that looked at the

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,000
holistic view on c cell development and

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,039
suggested a guideline for development

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,359
strengthening lessons learned from

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,599
national practice peer-to-peer

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,039
collaboration

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,480
regional practice

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,880
while leveraging the response and

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,840
resources from international arrangement

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,640
via system network and capacity building

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,399
partners

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,360
i talked about a living document because

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,320
it has allowed us to learn from what

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,600
have happened

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,320
so far and introduce topic for future

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,239

will be as follow a presentation of the

58
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,800
report and methodology

59
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,319
then you will have

60
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,599
some intervention from a few of us and

61
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,319
then we will open the floor for question

62
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,319
on this note dr

63
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,440
tata

64
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,280
you may want to take the floor and

65
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,959
present us the

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,840
methodology and the

67
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,120
approach uh thank you jean robert for

68
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,080
the introduction uh i shared my screen

69
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,440
can everyone see the screen

70
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,560
okay perfect i can start

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,280
as john roberts said in this

72
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,680
session we will share the findings and

73
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,400
the reports of our gfc and the global

74
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,640
affairs canada funded project

75
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,360
and

76
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,519
approaches and practices for increasing

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,680
the maturity and capabilities for c

78
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,760
source national cesars in the emerging

79
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,519
economies

80
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,680
in this project we aim to create a

81
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,319
tailorable guide for emerging economies

82
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,360
to develop or improve their

83
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,760
c-sort capabilities in an affordable way

84
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,159
to respond to the evolving cyber threat

85
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,080
environment effectively

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,480
in this project we first identified the

87
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,799
current national sea sort state in

88
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,799
emerging economies what services they

89
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,159
deliver what are their personal capacity

90
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,080
technical capability technological

91
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,239
infrastructure legal base and whenever

92
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,120
applicable uh their governance structure

93
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,760
and then we identified the services

94
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,879
which the emerging economies seizures

95
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,760
plan to deliver or expand the capacity

96
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,840
of the the services in the next five

97
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,720
years

98
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,799
and then we mapped each research service

99
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,319
to the required knowledge skills and

100
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,120
abilities and also the technical tools

101
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,439
and then we identified the

102
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,599
affordable trainings and tools to

103
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,519
develop this capacity in national

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,920
seasons

105
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,760
the important thing is this is for

106
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,000
aimed at emerging economies but the

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
authors of this report can be used by

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,319
any c-sort

109
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,399
in our methodology we first conducted a

110
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,798
task review and analyzed what are the

111
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,479
previous works what are the available

112
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,759
resources

113
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,560
and

114
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,440
and then we collected data by surveys

115
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,479
and interviews with

116
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,160
collected data through surveys from 16

117
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,960
national c suites in emerging economies

118
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,120
and then we conducted 10 follow-up

119
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,040
interviews

120
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,080
and then we validated our report before

121
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,000
it's published by the subject matter

122
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,560
experts

123
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,320
uh the output of this uh project

124
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,120
are two reports the first one is a

125
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,600
literature review and the second one is

126
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,639
the the tools trainings uh

127
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,400
and knowledge skills abilities tools and

128
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,720
trainings for c sort development plus

129
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,880
the best practices we identified and

130
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,360
also the recommendations the total of

131
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,680
these two reports are around 100 pages

132
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,360
so it's not

133
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,680
possible to share all the details in

134
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,400
this

135
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
presentation but

136
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,560
if you want to visit the reports the

137
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,880
links of these reports are available on

138
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,680
the

139
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,759
on the conference webpage the in the on

140
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,440
the abstract of our presentation

141
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,639
now i will briefly share the outputs and

142
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,639
findings of our reports

143
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,960
the part one the first report is a

144
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,680
literature review in this report

145
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,800
uh

146
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,880
we discussed the c sort maturity models

147
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,919
the

148
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,000
those matrix models are very useful to

149
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
see where you are and then plan where

150
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,800
you want to be sim 3 nss maturity models

151
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,880
are two of them we discussed in the

152
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,840
model so how c source can reveal

153
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,440
themselves and plan uh the future

154
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,759
but these maturity models

155
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,360
do not provide an answer to how to

156
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,360
improve

157
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,440
an assessor capability

158
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,360
okay where you are and where you want to

159
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
go you can plan it but how to do it it

160
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,199
is not

161
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,720
it's not something that you can get this

162
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,479
much with mothers so

163
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,440
we provided in the in this report the

164
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,600
organizational values models and

165
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,560
processes and also the national access

166
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,440
international and regional exercises and

167
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,039
we relied on the

168
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,440
the reports and the guideline documents

169
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,560
from gfc and tfc cert and other

170
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,240
organizations

171
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,919
to show the guidelines and best

172
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,600
practices

173
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,039
and also

174
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,319
in the national practices part we

175
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,280
shared different and some innovative

176
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,400
funding

177
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,759
mechanisms

178
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,479
the national systems created to sustain

179
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,520
their operations for

180
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,840
how to access the regional resources or

181
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,080
how to create a pipeline of c sort

182
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,240
experts from the universities this kind

183
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,000
of uh

184
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,240
specific national practices are also

185
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,199
discussed in this first first report the

186
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,520
second report is the current state and

187
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,199
future protection of the national sea

188
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,919
source in emerging economies

189
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,400
we conducted a survey and we shared the

190
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,000
survey results and also

191
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,840
also the interview results

192
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,960
as i mentioned uh we conducted a survey

193
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,520
to understand which services those

194
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,360
seizures deliver and what type of

195
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,560
technical and organizational

196
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,639
capabilities they have and what their

197
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,479
medium and long-term goals and their

198
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,240
best practices in capacity building

199
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,000
there were

200
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,520
28 respondents to our survey but when we

201
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,520
eliminated the incomplete ones and the

202
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,360
repetitive submissions from the same

203
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,440
national sisters

204
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,759
the results resulted in

205
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,120
16 final uh responses

206
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,400
and the national research

207
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,160
representatives who responded to the

208
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,080
survey had a very good understanding of

209
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,560
the technical and organizational

210
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,240
aspects of the national research

211
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,800
services in addition to a sufficient

212
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,879
grasp of the national needs of the

213
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,879
corresponding country

214
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,759
so

215
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,479
even though it's just 16 but they are

216
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,919
experts so the validity and is very high

217
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,440
of the survey

218
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,000
you can see the list of the the national

219
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,360
resorts

220
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,440
responded to our

221
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,479
survey

222
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,958
as you can see it's a very diverse group

223
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,799
some of the national sisters was

224
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,880
established almost

225
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,839
15 years ago and but some of them are

226
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,720
very

227
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,839
new established in 2020 2021

228
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,959
and in terms of geographies you can see

229
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,120
mostly in africa but there are national

230
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,920
sisters from asia-pacific pacific region

231
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,360
and a lot uh

232
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,080
latin america regions as well so it's a

233
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,920
very mixed group and when you look at

234
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,720
the global cyber security industry index

235
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,760
ranking group these national seizures

236
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,920
some of them are in top

237
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,880
40 but some of them are

238
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,080
around 100 so in terms of

239
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,320
cyber security development index is also

240
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,040
a mix

241
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,000
so we believe that the responses uh

242
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,839
reflect the

243
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,920
the current situation and the future

244
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,560
plans of the

245
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,240
of the

246
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,080
emerging economy national sisters

247
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
i will share some of the

248
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,560
the survey results here with you

249
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,120
before going to the conclusion part

250
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,959
um

251
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,240
11 of the 16 national sisters indicated

252
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,320
they do not have sufficient staff and 10

253
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,959
of them indicated that their stop stab

254
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,279
are not sufficiently trained so this

255
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,120
shows that why this project and these

256
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,519
reports are very valuable because this

257
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,640
uh guidelines will help them to

258
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,440
show

259
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,120
or plan

260
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,040
training their

261
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
personnel

262
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,880
and

263
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,120
nine of the national seizures indicated

264
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,680
their staff members they need more staff

265
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,440
members to provide a better service

266
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,480
quality

267
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,680
and

268
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,079
five of them indicated uh they have

269
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,000
sufficient staff but they need to

270
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,079
increase the qualifications technical

271
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,240
and uh soft skill qualifications of

272
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,680
their

273
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,240
personnel to deliver a high quality

274
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,000
service

275
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,279
in terms of technical skills the top

276
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,040
skills

277
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,640
in demand are

278
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,560
the highly demanded skills are malware

279
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,600
analysis industrial control system ics

280
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,360
and scada security

281
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,120
and the

282
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,399
11 of the 16 sisters indicated their

283
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,240
staff needs to improve the cyber threat

284
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,320
monitoring and analysis skills and 10 of

285
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,399
them indicated they need to improve

286
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,480
their staff's skill for digital

287
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,320
forensics penetration testing data

288
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,399
analytics and programming skills so

289
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,720
these are the skills

290
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,800
in high demand

291
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,839
in this emerging economic national

292
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,079
we know that technical skills are very

293
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,320
important very very important but they

294
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,440
are not just

295
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,480
the

296
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,560
they are only a part of the work the

297
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,320
soft skills because the national

298
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,480
scissors they are always dealing with

299
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,160
different stakeholders national

300
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,240
international and regional levels so

301
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,800
they need to have good uh

302
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,680
soft skills and when we surveyed about

303
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,040
the soft skills

304
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,519
eight of the national seizures indicated

305
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,079
that they need to improve the written or

306
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,800
oral communication and relationship

307
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,560
management skills at the national and

308
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,959
international levels and six of them

309
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,279
indicated that their staff needs to

310
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,440
improve their ability to cope with

311
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,399
stress and problem solving

312
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,200
when we look at the tools they need

313
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,760
the heist meant is cyber threat

314
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,440
intelligence feeds

315
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,560
and malware analysis reverse engineering

316
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,959
and stakeholder management these are the

317
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,079
the

318
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,760
the tools

319
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,680
they need at the highest demand

320
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,639
some tools challenges uh

321
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,360
13 of the national seizures they do not

322
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,440
have enough budget to buy high quality

323
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,399
tools where to to

324
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,160
conduct their operations to sustain

325
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,600
their operations

326
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,320
and 12 of them said they use open source

327
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,560
tools in production environment four of

328
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,720
them also indicated they prefer not to

329
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,040
use or use the open source tools just

330
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,160
for testing purposes while the five of

331
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,360
them

332
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,440
indicated they prefer open source tools

333
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,519
rather than the commercial tools

334
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,000
these are all important inputs

335
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,160
to figure out which tools and trainings

336
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,920
are more appropriate for this emerging

337
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,000
economies in the

338
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,560
in the next part of our report

339
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,839
um

340
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,839
majority of this platform

341
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,680
in terms of trainings

342
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,800
uh

343
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,880
although it has to a host of free and

344
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,880
affordable training platforms access

345
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,720
national cesars

346
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,720
a majority of them they do not utilize

347
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,959
platforms like edx course era udemy

348
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,160
udacity

349
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,399
and the similar platforms but most of

350
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,519
them use first application and itu

351
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,800
trainings

352
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,880
and there are also some existing

353
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,800
arrangements with organizations like

354
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,000
sans ics square and comptia for national

355
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,480
capacity building to access these

356
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,399
trainings in an affordable way

357
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,480
we also conducted interwebs with

358
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,000
three of the national cesars and

359
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,199
several

360
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,600
subject matter experts to figure out the

361
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,079
best practices and get a deeper

362
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,040
understanding of their survey responses

363
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,959
and also figure out the best practices

364
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,120
find out the best practices in national

365
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,639
security capacity development

366
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,959
now affordable tools and trainings for

367
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,040
national resort development

368
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,720
because of the time constraint i will

369
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,440
not gain the full details but i will

370
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,680
share how we identified and how we

371
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,199
presented this part in our report

372
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,079
first at first we used the

373
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,279
first nash uh first c word services

374
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,360
framework there are five service areas

375
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,199
and we used

376
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,920
these service areas and the services

377
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,320
under each service area as our

378
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,519
baseline

379
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,720
and then

380
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,519
we used also survey results to see which

381
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,079
services

382
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,720
are in high demand and which services

383
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,959
the emerging economic national sisters

384
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,440
want to deliver in the next five years

385
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
and then we use

386
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,519
the national institute of standards of

387
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,519
technologies

388
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,160
cyber security workforce framework to

389
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
map the required knowledge skills and

390
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,440
abilities for each service area

391
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,240
and then we identify tools and trainings

392
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,680
for each

393
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,160
service based on this knowledge skills

394
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,399
and abilities and competencies

395
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,600
so it's a very systematic way and

396
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,199
the the the list of the tools and

397
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,440
trainings we provided in our report is

398
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,600
not an exhaustive list

399
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,480
but it gives you a very good starting

400
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,120
point for developing capacity in

401
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,920
emerging economies

402
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,639
we also identified several innovations

403
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,839
in our

404
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,759
through our interviews

405
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,880
in national resort capacity building and

406
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,959
we provided several recommendations

407
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,720
such as creating a pipeline of

408
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,360
cybersecurity workforce with connection

409
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,880
with universities and academic

410
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,720
institutions and leveraging

411
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,959
public-private partnership and very

412
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,440
innovative funding mechanisms and

413
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,759
knowledge transfer from other cesars in

414
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,639
the region or from the regional or

415
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,279
international cooperation cooperation

416
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,759
and also getting some funding in

417
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,000
scissors establishment

418
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,600
from regional and international

419
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,040
organizations

420
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,920
to

421
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,240
create their first services

422
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,000
my colleagues uh

423
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,680
will give some

424
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,839
examples of these

425
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,000
innovations the details of this

426
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,639
before passing microphone to my

427
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,800
colleagues to give the details of these

428
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,759
innovations and best practices i want to

429
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,440
say thank you

430
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,519
to global affairs

431
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,759
canada and gfc to supporting this

432
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,720
research without their support this uh

433
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,240
this research will not have what would

434
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,440
not happen

435
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,759
and also the national sisters who

436
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,759
responded to our survey and also the

437
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,079
subject matter experts who

438
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,320
interrupted us we interviewed with them

439
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,440
and

440
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,079
they provided

441
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,240
excellent insights to our report and

442
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,720
finally the the members of the project

443
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,720
oversight group for their feedback to

444
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,959
improve this report

445
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,520
now i want to pass the microphone to my

446
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,240
colleagues uh dr

447
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,359
uh dr shirapashim to share about some of

448
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,599
these innovations in c cert capacity

449
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,000
building

450
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,599
thank you dr tata

451
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,200
it's really a pleasure to share with you

452
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,440
the results and i'd like to highlight a

453
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,160
few uh i mean issues when it comes to

454
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,520
establishing uh especially caesars with

455
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,559
national uh responsibility

456
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,799
sometimes it is challenging in emerging

457
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,480
economies uh

458
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,799
to to reach out you know agreements

459
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,120
about the mission and the objectives and

460
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,240
the scope of work uh so um

461
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,919
one of the lessons learned from

462
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,960
especially uh cases like in egypt for

463
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
instance the egyptian search started as

464
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,200
a sectoral certain we have seen

465
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,600
today how sectoral certs work so it

466
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,160
started as a sector work i mean cert

467
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,520
within the ict sector uh funded by and

468
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,080
supported by the regulators so again we

469
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,480
tried to establish this within a

470
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,120
framework of i mean the regulator

471
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,640
however it is distant from the

472
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,559
regulatory activities which was quite

473
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,799
challenging but uh being part of the

474
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,039
regulator we had i mean the egypt cert

475
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,000
had

476
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,280
the available funds to pursue its work

477
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,039
it is very important also uh once

478
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,559
you have the high-level political

479
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,160
support uh

480
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,600
that you uh

481
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
identify core activities and core

482
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,520
services to be provided managing

483
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,400
expectations and and really working you

484
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,440
know one step at the time is really

485
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,720
important and

486
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
starting with the basic services and

487
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,039
instant handling and management

488
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,880
the cyber forensics

489
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,799
malware analysis vulnerability

490
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,679
assessments uh and pen testings were

491
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,000
like the bread and butter of many

492
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,640
seasons uh across the globe so that was

493
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,080
really important

494
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,200
and to move forward uh by having a

495
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,840
tailored solution that is scalable and

496
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,280
the building capacity was critical uh at

497
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,160
the beginning and and moving forward um

498
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,240
many emerging economies and and

499
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,480
low-income countries they suffer because

500
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,320
of you know you have the brain drain

501
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,080
within the country and outside the

502
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,720
country so how to build you know enough

503
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,520
uh uh pool of experts and professionals

504
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,120
uh was quite challenging at the

505
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,600
beginning when each research started in

506
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,520
2009 and

507
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
there was an innovation there

508
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,919
a national program was launched because

509
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,080
of lobbying from egypt's earth

510
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,840
it was supported

511
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,960
at high level within the ict sector and

512
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,320
it provided training for over 220

513
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,200
professionals from 38 organizations not

514
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,360
just in the ict sector but in the

515
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,200
financial sector in other critical

516
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
sectors as well

517
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,559
that program resulted in more than 179

518
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,240
professionals received multiple

519
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,080
certificates from sans

520
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,080
uh over a period of a year and a half so

521
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,159
immediately we jump started you know the

522
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,000
available resources

523
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,480
and it created partnerships that lasted

524
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,880
for years to come so building trust is

525
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,520
key to the success of c certs and that

526
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,679
act of you know innovation building

527
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,760
capacity at the same time building you

528
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,400
know the network of partners 38

529
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,799
organizations government private sector

530
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,280
academia across different sectors was

531
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,799
really critical

532
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,520
in the for the success of issue

533
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,360
to have allah

534
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,960
i mean

535
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,600
synergies with other caesars what also

536
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,840
critical we have had the relationship

537
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,240
with the malaysian cert with the us sir

538
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,960
research from europe uh uh

539
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,720
ap cert uh

540
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,799
from asia and africa uh isis uh isis had

541
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,720
had you know a lot of cooperation with

542
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,400
african certs with arab certs uh so it

543
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,480
was really a give and take

544
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,880
at the beginning we were taking more

545
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,520
support uh then later on uh also

546
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,280
exchanging and supporting

547
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,760
other african csers

548
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,480
i say we because i was responsible for

549
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,400
the la i mean uh the team responsible

550
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,120
for launching each earth

551
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,000
over

552
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,799
12 years ago and

553
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,799
i overlooked its uh

554
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,880
activities within a national

555
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,720
responsibility

556
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,799
technology transfer is key building

557
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,760
trust uh i'm really glad to see you know

558
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,799
a lot of uh emphasis on building trust

559
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,200
trust you earn trust it's not something

560
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
that you can buy you can buy tools you

561
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,880
can buy you know uh software but uh

562
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,960
it's it's building trust is critical to

563
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,120
the success of uh

564
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,000
national seasons uh i'd like to pass the

565
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,840
floor to my colleague dr kaleem

566
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,919
uh who has you know uh also a unique

567
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,880
experience from africa so dr kaleem the

568
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,039
floor is yours

569
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,360
uh thank you uh dr schiff and uh first

570
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,760
of all i'd like to do to thank uh first

571
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,480
for uh giving us an opportunity to talk

572
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,159
on to this particular interesting

573
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,640
project and as my colleagues have been

574
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,960
uh talking about that what normally we

575
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,840
did in terms of looking at the uh

576
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,400
increasing maturity and capabilities for

577
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,520
uh seizures in emerging economies so

578
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,799
in fact in quickly what i wanted to add

579
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,360
that in terms of services that uh which

580
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,559
services

581
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,960
we have found

582
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,679
that they are the most basic services as

583
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,760
power study and and also

584
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,760
the the priority uh instance uh

585
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,600
development to

586
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,840
improve assistance uh service let's say

587
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,400
within these particular search so as i

588
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,480
mentioned uh that we uh let's interview

589
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,919
a 16

590
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,480
ssc suits and attend one of 10 of them

591
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,640
were from africa three from asia pacific

592
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,760
and three latin america and the the the

593
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,799
the framework which was used in order to

594
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,200
let's say uh scan their services were a

595
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,400
first user services framework and as we

596
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,960
mentioned into our presentation that it

597
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,240
has

598
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,280
uh five main areas and and these five

599
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,559
main areas it stands over security event

600
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,640
management to acknowledge transfer so

601
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,600
basically what we did is that

602
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,200
we have let's say take in all 21 let's

603
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,600
say service areas it means subservice

604
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,640
areas out of let's say these five main

605
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,520
service areas and we we scan through and

606
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,919
and then we have what we found is that

607
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,640
there are varying and maturity levels uh

608
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,480
for the different assistants which we

609
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,679
have

610
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,080
uh let's say you scan through obviously

611
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,640
which we have analyzed and also uh some

612
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,600
of them uh in terms of the services we

613
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,400
did not offer uh is a security event

614
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,880
management uh information security

615
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,880
incident management and also

616
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,360
vulnerability management so

617
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,279
these are the services which uh most

618
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,320
research

619
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,760
uh

620
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,720
the the the uh are looking uh forward to

621
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,600
offer these services basically uh why uh

622
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,559
it is uh so that they do not have a

623
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,679
required

624
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,159
capacity in order to let's say offer

625
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,080
these services to their constituency

626
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,480
members and also something what we we

627
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
found is the

628
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,520
greater emphasis uh which is given on to

629
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,960
uh situation analysis and and the

630
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,200
knowledge uh transfer so that was

631
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,039
something again uh what we

632
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,480
have uh

633
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,640
noticed and and also it is important to

634
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,799
note that information uh security email

635
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,320
management and situation awareness

636
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,640
categories uh draw an important interest

637
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,440
about new services uh once we let's say

638
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,120
uh have uh try to uh uh even uh talk to

639
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,360
us some of them and they they want to

640
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,440
move around let's see these these

641
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,960
services uh in in in future

642
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,799
and one of the bottlenecks which they

643
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,520
have been saying because uh we also uh

644
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,200
interviewed different people and we saw

645
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,279
or for example togo we do the example of

646
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,320
asia pacific where we uh look at samwa

647
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,120
and one ato

648
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,559
so a similar kind of say uh

649
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,480
impression we got from the experts whom

650
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,960
we have been uh talking to so uh and and

651
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,480
that's another reason could be a boost

652
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,240
of qualification because ultimately what

653
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,520
we need to have is that we need to have

654
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,440
the capacity for this staff in order to

655
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,360
deliver these uh

656
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,919
services so and and and also as dr

657
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,520
sheriff mentioned that

658
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,440
one of the reasons also that they do not

659
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,080
have a qualified let's say experts

660
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,760
available like in many other countries

661
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,120
so this also something what we saw uh is

662
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,760
which was which was uh therefore uh

663
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,360
let's say uh

664
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,159
c-suits as as a challenge in order for

665
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,559
them to let's say offer these services

666
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,760
but again uh what also uh let's say uh

667
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,919
we we saw the interest for for uh

668
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,559
different us analysis users start uh

669
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,880
their services on these lines like

670
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,200
incident and vulnerability handling

671
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,840
advisories and alerts and warnings i

672
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,600
mean this is again something on an

673
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,039
improved let's say an enhanced mode

674
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,960
intrusion detection security assessments

675
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,320
malware analysis and and cyber threat

676
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,400
monitoring so uh

677
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,039
the these were uh some of the let's say

678
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:27,840
uh

679
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,080
uh services where these seasons they

680
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,559
want to build up uh their uh let's say

681
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,440
uh capacity and and then also uh

682
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,919
something what we have noticed is the

683
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,600
limited budget because i think we spoke

684
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,120
about the budget and there are many uh

685
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,440
suits but they do not have enough budget

686
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,200
in order to have infrastructure

687
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,480
in order to let's say uh have this uh

688
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,520
uh necessary this is started so these

689
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,279
are the few things quickly we noted and

690
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,840
also i think uh one of the things and

691
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,320
take away from is that all those let's

692
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,880
see emerging us economies those who are

693
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,120
building this research so they should be

694
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,799
starting with let's say a service by

695
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,600
service rather than coming back to

696
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
let's say uh many services at the same

697
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,200
time so this is much easier to manage

698
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,400
this is much easier to let's say uh uh

699
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,240
offered to their constituency members

700
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,080
and that will be also easier to maintain

701
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,760
the quality of the service so looking at

702
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,600
the time maybe i'll stop here and i'll

703
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,000
pass on the floor to uh my let's say

704
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,600
over to you john

705
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,360
yeah uh thank you

706
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,200
i will go very quick to give the

707
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,960
opportunity for question if there are

708
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,720
some questions so i say with your

709
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,039
narcissist organization

710
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,440
being able to

711
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,279
outline

712
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,240
challenges and opportunities for example

713
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,200
justine talked today about

714
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,640
some of the

715
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,679
advantage and take away from

716
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,320
related to the host organization

717
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,559
is very key to our work

718
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,039
some of some of the challenges that we

719
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,880
were able to see

720
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,240
and that we try to outline from what a

721
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
couple of teams are doing and how they

722
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,279
can

723
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,840
uh learn from each other how they

724
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,080
overcame overcame those different

725
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,720
challenges and turned to opportunities

726
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,279
are things around

727
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,679
competing priorities resource mobility

728
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:23,360
mobilization skills development

729
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,960
retention

730
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,080
funding sustainability and highlighting

731
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,760
their approach taking by some teams like

732
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,279
edges that you have heard about but also

733
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,399
teams building private public private

734
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:39,840
partnership

735
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,640
to

736
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,320
leverage the

737
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,480
constrained resources

738
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,120
that they have makes an interesting

739
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,000
point and also a learning opportunity

740
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,240
for various uh

741
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,559
development programs within emergency

742
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:59,760
research um some of the few also area of

743
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,880
improvement that we have noticed from

744
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,399
those teams

745
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,760
are reflected through various exercises

746
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,000
a strengthening partnership with

747
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,240
capacity implementers

748
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,640
peer-to-peer collaboration

749
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,080
being able to

750
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,600
leverage from those learning

751
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,120
opportunities and developing knowledge

752
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,240
modules

753
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,159
skills

754
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,039
driven from the ecosystem and also

755
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,080
working uh with a various organization

756
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,640
where they can identify

757
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,840
find resources uh create opportunities

758
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,440
for uh trend development antenna and

759
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,240
shape and mutual assistance so on this

760
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,559
load i will give the floor back to you

761

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,080
in countries and emerging economies and

770
