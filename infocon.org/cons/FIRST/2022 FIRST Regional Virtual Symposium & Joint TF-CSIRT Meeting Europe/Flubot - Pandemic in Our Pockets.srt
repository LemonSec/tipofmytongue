before this i was working for national

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,879
cyber security center of finland

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,200
i have a degree in uh information

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,320
security and cryptography uh and i'm

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,079
doing a lot of cyber security related

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,559
stuff on my free time as well

22
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,360
i

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,800
i could say

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,199
that i'm digital forensics and user

25
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,800
response specialist but i do a bunch of

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,400
other stuff as well like analyze

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,880
malware

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,840
and

29
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,000
uh i'm going to talk to you a little bit

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,400
about floorbot also known as uh cabazos

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,840
uh today

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,799
uh it's a android bank in troian uh it's

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,560
just distributed through uh sms messages

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,360
and

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,320
the

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,040
drop sites which are hosting the actual

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,520
malware are actually

38
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,119
compromised wordpress sites

39
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,520
this malware has been seen first time in

40
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,759
the wild

41
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,000
over one year ago in december 2020

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,240
and the malware is continuously

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,640
developed so we are seeing a lot of new

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,360
versions and i think there is actually a

45
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,759
new version which is not covered by this

46
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,360
presentation so i i think i need to

47
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,600
update my uh details as well

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,920
uh it's trying to mimic legit

49
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,119
applications so uh the most of the

50
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,679
variants have been mimicking dhl

51
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,920
tracking application there has been also

52
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,040
variants that are mimicking chrome and

53
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,200
also voicemail and

54
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,599
can you imagine that flash player is

55
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,599
also mimicked in in 2021 and 2022

56
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,400
especially in android devices where it

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,720
hasn't been available

58
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,120
ever so

59
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,160
it's interesting uh interesting uh

60
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,440
way to

61
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,920
swim to the phones of of

62
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,000
victims

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,400
uh i a little bit want to illustrate how

64
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,680
how the uh this actual pandemic in our

65
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,239
pockets is spreading uh

66
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,120
it requires user actions it's it's not a

67
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,840
worm it's it it requires actions from

68
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,200
user and uh it starts from infected

69
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,840
phones uh user will get an sms with link

70
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,519
to dropsite

71
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,879
and if they do click the website open

72
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,680
they will end up to the to a site with

73
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,800
with tries

74
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,480
which tries to mimic uh legit uh

75
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,640
legit application or legit website

76
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,640
and uh it will have uh some kind of lure

77
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,360
that

78
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,159
the user needs to download the

79
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,519
application from the site and then

80
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,720
install it and as you can see from the

81
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,319
uh from the

82
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,440
little text there it says that uh

83
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,560
as the newer androids uh

84
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,080
do not allow site loading by default it

85
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,280
tells user to allow site loading from

86
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,000
settings so that they can install the

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,480
application to their phone

88
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,760
and uh we have also seen uh drop sites

89
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,879
which are uh

90
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,920
telling the user uh their phone number

91
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,879
so uh there is a

92
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,840
correlation between the uh send sms

93
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,439
messages uh the drop side and the uh and

94
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,879
the uh victim number so so

95
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,880
when if you get a message

96
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,478
uh it will be likely uh very targeted to

97
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,120
your phone number not to you but to your

98
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,880
phone number

99
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,320
if the user uh downloads the application

100
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,440
they will

101
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,880
infect their phone with the malware and

102
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,520
first of all the malware tries to find

103
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,840
out which is the public ip address of

104
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,680
the device so it's using public services

105
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,199
for that ipinfo icon has ip

106
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,280
ipfy and track ip

107
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,240
and then it stores the public ip address

108
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,440
of the uh

109
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,639
phone to the shared preferences which i

110
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,479
will go through later in this uh

111
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,639
presentation

112
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,800
uh then it starts to uh

113
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,639
connect to uh to the c2 uh using uh

114
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,320
public uh

115
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,680
dns over https services

116
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,360
like google cloudflare and alibaba dns

117
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,000
it has also uh in previous version it

118
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,520
previous versions it has used also next

119
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,320
dns which is uh

120
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,240
well they promote themselves as a

121
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,280
premium dns service and they started

122
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,080
blocking the floorbot which led to the

123
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,120
flobot actors to drop uh that next dns

124
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,919
as their as their one of uh as their one

125
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,280
of their uh dns over https servers

126
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,440
so this is this is like the overview how

127
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,280
the how the uh flowbot infects the phone

128
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,120
and then it starts to spread

129
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,400
elsewhere so it's using the victim phone

130
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,960
to send sms messages to a list which it

131
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,800
cuts from uh gets from the c2 server so

132
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,639
uh the list is uh

133
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,160
likely uh uh stolen from other victim

134
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,560
phones and then used in other lifting

135
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,240
phones uh as target numbers so so it is

136
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,960
pretty advanced way uh to spread uh

137
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,160
through sms messages

138
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,039
the uh floobat has been uh

139
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,800
developed as i said previously there is

140
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,800
continuously uh new versions coming out

141
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,160
and uh

142
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,960
uh here is a little timeline uh how

143
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,400
often they are making new versions so uh

144
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,600
the uh

145
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,000
blue part is where uh i started

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,840
following the uh

147
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,120
flowbot and uh it's its capabilities and

148
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,520
how how it has been developed

149
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,840
and and what kind of functions it has so

150
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,960
i dropped uh to the flobot

151
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,560
analysis uh

152
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,240
in in june 2021 and has been ever since

153
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,120
following following this project uh

154
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,840
either on a work time or on my free time

155
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,479
and i i'm still still continuously

156
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,880
following the updates and analyzing the

157
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,080
new variants of the of the software

158
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,560
but the uh key key points were uh in in

159
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,960
november when it adopted the uh dns over

160
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,639
https

161
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,720
as uh as a

162
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,960
c2 channel so uh then it got hard

163
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,240
because the operators couldn't

164
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,599
anymore filter the command and control

165
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,680
channel so

166
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,039
then

167
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,560
then the

168
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,759
malware uh got more

169
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,520
sneaky and

170
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,759
harder to defend us as a

171
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,199
operator or any any other

172
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,360
organization

173
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,039
later on it has

174
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,319
got more updates which a little bit

175
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,720
harder the analysis process for example

176
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,520
there has been more obfuscation uh

177
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,039
put it to the software and also some

178
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,960
dga updates

179
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,440
i will talk shortly more about the dga

180
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,080
which is the domain generation algorithm

181
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,639
which the flobot has been using

182
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,479
at least since the last summer

183
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,800
so

184
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,759
analyzing apk packages is usually pretty

185
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,160
easy and straightforward if they are not

186
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,320
packed and of course uh

187
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,200
flowbot is using packing uh to make our

188
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,519
security professionals work a little bit

189
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,640
harder

190
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,440
so

191
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,240
older versions of flubat used

192
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,600
apk protector which was pretty easy

193
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,120
to

194
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,000
to deofuscate but then they moved to the

195
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,120
custom

196
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,880
custom encryption or packing process

197
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,519
which is described here uh it starts

198
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,760
with the uh all the strings are of

199
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,080
course obfuscated in the first version

200
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,959
there is the uh the obfuscation uh part

201
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,880
where the uh

202
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,279
where the numbers are sort with the uh

203
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,519
given number and and then it returns the

204
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,720
string one its string uh uh to the uh to

205
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,839
the actual source code then uh it has an

206
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,200
archive inside of it it's a jet lip

207
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
compressed data

208
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,920
and

209
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,680
then it it will be unarchived uh before

210
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,080
it will get decrypted

211
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,360
and uh the decryption decryption uh i

212
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,399
will present it shortly

213
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,519
but it's totally total custom with the

214
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,720
hard-coded uh password in the in this

215
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
sample and uh

216
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,160
the

217
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,279
the password is actually uh different on

218
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,000
each sample so uh

219
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,720
it has been they have changed the

220
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,480
password along the uh along the uh uh

221
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,120
development process so so uh there won't

222
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,839
be that many hash matches with the uh

223
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,399
with the sample so it will be also

224
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,720
harder to track which version of the

225
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,680
flow but is going around the

226
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,800
uh your country if you don't have uh

227
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
capability to

228
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,360
to uh the uh debug the uh malware

229
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,519
then uh after the decryption there will

230
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,399
be another archive uh which is also

231
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,200
catalytic compressed data and after

232
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,279
archiving that one we will get the

233
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,160
actual

234
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,760
classes.dxdex which is the uh

235
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,560
actual uh where the actual source core

236
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,880
source code resides and where we can see

237
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,120
what the what the program is actually

238
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,040
doing

239
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,760
unfortunately for us uh of course the

240
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,040
strings are encrypted in the in the uh

241
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,120
classes.txtx as well and there is the

242
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,079
function actually every class of the the

243
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,800
x has their own uh

244
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,680
decryption uh function uh it's it's

245
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,640
using the same algorithm but the uh

246
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,440
table of the of the uh

247
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,560
uh in the curse which is with it which

248
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,399
it is using for

249
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,880
for the decryption uh changes in every

250
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,480
class

251
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,600
so uh if we go back to the timeline uh

252
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,279
the uh change was made be uh between the

253
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,560
version 4.5 which was the first version

254
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,880
i i got involved with and uh it was

255
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,079
using the apk protector and uh then on

256
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,320
november when when the malware hit

257
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,120
finland again it was using a custom

258
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,800
decrypter so there was a lot of

259
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,200
development happened before uh between

260
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,079
the uh these two dates in in only five

261
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,760
months so uh

262
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,920
it has been interesting to follow follow

263
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,160
up the process and how they have been uh

264
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,760
like um

265
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,880
reacting to the uh to the actual uh

266
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,120
actual uh

267
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,839
uh things we have been doing for

268
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,639
defending the malware but uh let's take

269
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,639
a look closer look to the uh uh

270
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,200
encryption so uh this is uh i think this

271
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,079
is version 5.2 which is uh like uh two

272
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,040
months old version of the floorbot uh it

273
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,920
has uh the android manifest is usually

274
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,320
telling the process flow uh so which

275
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,560
which of the activities are done first

276
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,240
which of the services which of the

277
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,360
reserves are started so we can see that

278
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,079
there is this contents and mobile qq

279
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,800
which is mimicking a legit

280
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,160
package name

281
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,720
and there is uh there is some kind of

282
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,880
code which is executed but we cannot

283
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,480
find it from the uh sources so we can uh

284
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,839
we can uh

285
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,760
assume that there is some kind of

286
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,000
packing in place and and if we go one

287
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,560
step uh before we can see that there is

288
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,279
some package which is executed before

289
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,360
that and and uh it's likely that the

290
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,079
unbacking happens there if we see that

291
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,959
code there we can find out easily that

292
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,279
there was this uh

293
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,160
uh archive i was talking uh earlier it's

294
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,680
the uh tetley compressed data the uh uh

295
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,519
file from the assets

296
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,800
uh and a random random uh folder name

297
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,440
and random file name with the extension

298
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,720
uh q

299
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,680
key

300
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,120
u

301
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,160
no idea how to pronounce that one but uh

302
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
we can see that there is this uh file

303
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,720
coming out from this uh obfuscated

304
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,000
strings uh strings which is uh which uh

305
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,600
the uh

306
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,639
class is actually actually uh

307
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,600
on archiving and uh if we move uh

308
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,000
forward we can see that there is uh

309
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,880
actually a decryption function uh which

310
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,600
is used uh which is uh

311
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,839
and there are actually three arguments

312
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,880
passed to this decryption function

313
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,320
uh which uh

314
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,320
first first of the arguments is the

315
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,519
password and if we look uh

316
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,240
up uh for the password we can see that's

317
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,760
this uh chinese uh looking a string uh

318
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,880
which decrypts the uh ascii string which

319
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,040
is shown here in

320
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,920
in a blue and and as i said this is a

321
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,079
sample uh specific uh password so this

322
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,199
password doesn't work uh on any other

323
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,160
samples most likely than than this one

324
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,199
are presented here

325
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,560
and uh

326
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,720
that actually is that actual string

327
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,040
actually means something i i want to

328
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,360
know if they they mean something and

329
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,839
when i put to the put it to the google

330
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,079
translate i was uh

331
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,360
happy to see that that the uh uncle is

332
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,399
unhappy uh for this password and uh

333
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,800
there there has been also other variants

334
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,880
of the passwords uh one of the passwords

335
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,360
was like evilness evilness evilness

336
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,680
evilness evilness in english and one of

337
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,199
the passwords was everlasting

338
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,680
everlasting everlasting everlasting so

339
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,959
uh i think the developers are have have

340
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,320
a little bit uh

341
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,160
blink in their eye when they're doing

342
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,120
this because uh this i i found this this

343
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,240
like golden easter eggs which they are

344
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,880
planting in their uh malware code

345
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,639
uh then then we can

346
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,880
then if we look to the actual uh

347
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,160
decryption function we can see that the

348
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,639
most of the function is nonsense and not

349
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,399
used in any matter

350
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,880
but but if we look closely we can see

351
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,639
that there is

352
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,800
only two characters of the

353
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,079
of the password used and uh and how they

354
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,720
are used uh uh is shown here in the

355
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,079
below so uh we we have uh two words

356
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,519
which we are using using for

357
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,120
for the uh

358
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,680
xor uh if if

359
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,560
depending on the position of the of the

360
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,160
current byte

361
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,720
and uh and uh if we campaign this

362
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,279
information we can write a short script

363
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,759
that uh decrypts uh the flow but

364
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,759
automatically

365
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,199
for us and

366
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,759
eases up our

367
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,959
analyzing process process uh when we can

368
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,639
just just give the uh give the uh

369
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,360
apk file to python and then start

370
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,720
analyzing the

371
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,440
actual classes.dxdex

372
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,160
which was uh decrypted from the

373
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,959
original sample

374
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,079
now we have decrypted our malware sample

375
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,440
so we can start analyzing it and before

376
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,959
that i i i wanted to show how this this

377
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,920
would look to the user so if the user

378
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,480
downloads the dhl

379
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,240
software

380
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,120
or

381
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,880
any other

382
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,000
flowbot

383
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,040
soft flow but variant mimicking legit

384
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,160
applications it will first ask

385
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
overlap

386
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,720
permissions uh from the user

387
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,880
so it will ask the user to turn on the

388
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,000
accessibility service

389
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,119
which

390
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,679
actually gives a lot of permissions

391
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,039
to the software in android basically

392
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,799
the software can show

393
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,240
user anything uh over the uh over the

394
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,439
actual application which is really bad

395
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,400
uh feature on the on the android phone

396
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,520
and uh

397
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,559
and a lot of different malware are

398
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,280
actually using this for

399
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,400
the uh

400
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,640
abusing this

401
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,240
function

402
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,799
then it will also ask

403
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,240
permissions to show notifications for

404
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,039
the user uh this is likely due the

405
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,520
newest feature which is

406
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,280
printing the

407
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,600
printing custom

408
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,000
custom notifications coming from the c2

409
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,440
to the user so

410
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,080
basically the attacker can show any

411
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,039
information they want to the user and by

412
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,240
that

413
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,520
try to

414
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,880
try to

415
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,200
fake any any application date that they

416
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,039
want

417
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,440
like i said before flowpath uses shared

418
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,200
preferences to store data permanently on

419
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,080
the phone so flow but

420
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,559
most of the options here

421
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,480
are

422
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,880
set during the installation of the

423
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,120
malware so when the user

424
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,919
first time starts the

425
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,880
starts the malicious application these

426
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,000
are generated and stored to the system

427
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,799
so uh the these are basically these are

428
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,480
the four four uh first ones so the

429
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,120
bot idea default sms application uh

430
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,200
status of the notification interception

431
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,799
and public ib address the actual dc is

432
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,480
the status of the notification

433
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,679
interception uh it comes from the c2 and

434
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,039
also uh this uh this um

435
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,000
flowbot has ability to uh

436
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,360
intercept the sms messages so basically

437
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,480
the user if the user receives an sms

438
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,880
message it won't be shown to the user

439
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,280
but instead it will be delivered to dc

440
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,720
to chan

441
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,440
through the c2 channel to the attacker

442
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,520
so basically this application has a lot

443
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,600
of capabilities for example by passing

444
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,000
mfa

445
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,360
so uh

446
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,640
after the installation uh flubot

447
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,520
is pretty noisy it will start calling

448
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,559
home uh using the uh do

449
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,559
h uh the

450
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,600
dns over https channel

451
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,280
uh first it sends uh prepping

452
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,640
to the dgas so it will generate a list

453
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,600
of domains and it will try which one of

454
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,360
them is currently in use and starts the

455
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,960
starts the uh starts to

456
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,600
interact with that specific c2

457
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,480
then it will continuously send a

458
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,400
comments ping

459
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,240
an sms rate to the c2 uh ping is

460
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,360
actually it it's kind of uh keep alive

461
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,200
comment it also has a lot of information

462
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,400
about the

463
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,480
endpoint the android phone it will have

464
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,960
a version of the flowbot there it will

465
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,120
have the uptime of the phone it will

466
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,480
have the carrier so which which carrier

467
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,760
the phone is using also if the sms

468
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,880
interception is on and also if the uh

469
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,360
notification interception is on so a lot

470
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,559
of data is going to the uh to the to the

471
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,080
c2

472
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,880
using that one

473
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,640
the uh

474
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,480
the uh

475
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,559
flu but will also upload the uh

476
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,919
the contact list of the phone to the to

477
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,799
the c2 so it will deliver all the

478
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,000
information found on the on the uh

479
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,400
contact list of the victim phone

480
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,600
i mentioned few times the dga

481
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,840
which is the domain generation

482
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,679
algorithm we can see from this

483
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,159
screenshot that the

484
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,200
flubat is actually looping

485
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,840
through the

486
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,720
set tld list

487
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,679
which is which is in version

488
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,000
5.2 and above

489
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,159
pretty long one before version 5.2 there

490
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,200
was only three tlds

491
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,960
the russian one

492
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,280
soviet union dot su and uh also china

493
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,000
the dot cn

494
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,039
and uh it generates a list of uh 2

495
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,520
500 domains and

496
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,360
continues if

497
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,919
alternative acid is set

498
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,799
the fluobat is using uh the java random

499
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,440
with uh with a

500
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,559
hard-coded seed so uh analyzing and

501
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,360
generating the dga

502
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,080
domain list is pretty easy when you have

503
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,760
access to the

504
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,400
decrypted malware sample

505
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,840
but

506
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,000
as i said they have

507
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,360
introduced the

508
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,400
updating

509
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,080
the seed function

510
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,679
as shown here the alternative seed from

511
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,720
the uh shared preferences

512
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,480
if it's set it will continue uh

513
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,159
continue

514
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,200
to uh generate these domains

515
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,039
and uh

516
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,640
this is something

517
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,919
we can't access so if they are using the

518
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,799
c2 to update the seed

519
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,120
it will be super hard to find out which

520
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,600
c2s the flow but this currently use

521
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,400
as i said the uh flowbot is using hard

522
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,919
coded seed it's shown here uh it's it's

523
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,679
usually has been the uh

524
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:12,320
1945

525
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,600
and uh it also you is using uh

526
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,080
the current year and current month for

527
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,080
generating the uh

528
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,600
c2 domains

529
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,440
so

530
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,520
yeah so

531
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,159
it will uh the domain list should be

532
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,360
generated

533
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,480
in every month and also with every seed

534
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,120
they are using before

535
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,640
implementing the dns over https they

536
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,200
were using different seeds for different

537
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,840
countries they are targeting

538
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,720
and and that was of course

539
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,279
that wasn't that hard to block those but

540
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,360
but of course every country had to

541
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,320
generate uh their own list of of uh

542
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,159
domains

543
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,320
the flowbot is using

544
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,799
and here is an example

545
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,880
of the actual uh domains it generates so

546
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,080
on the left we can see a february list

547
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,720
uh five first ones from there and from

548
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,760
the right side we can see the uh march

549
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,559
list

550
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,440
and uh as i have seen

551
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,559
the

552
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,600
flowbot

553
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,320
is usually using the

554
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,960
dot air u domains for c2 and the others

555
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,480
are just there

556
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,840
for bulk we have seen also the gina

557
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,520
domain the cn and also the su the soviet

558
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,240
union used as a c2 of course there might

559
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,400
be others but these are the preferred

560
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,840
ones this far and of course a lot of

561
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,000
these domains have been registered to

562
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,039
the uh

563
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,000
sinkholes and a lot of people are of

564
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,679
course and and

565
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,159
countrysides are monitoring which

566
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,720
which uh how many how many flow but

567
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,120
instances are trying to call the c2

568
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,799
channels

569
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,360
so how how the z2

570
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,400
tunneling works so this is basically the

571
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,480
way the flowbot talks to this e2 so it

572
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,679
uses a hard-coded

573
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,760
air as a public

574
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,880
key which is you which is you which it

575
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,919
uses to uh encrypt the rc4 uh key

576
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,039
key uh to deliver it to the c2 and

577
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,360
the whole data

578
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,720
the

579
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,480
the encrypted blob and also public ip

580
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,360
address and also the bot id of the

581
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,760
flowbot instance is base the 32

582
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,640
encoded and then delivered to the

583
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,080
to the

584
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,440
dns over https server using uh

585
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,080
chunks so basically it's it's spread to

586
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,679
the chunks and then these chunks are uh

587
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,600
requested from the doh and which all of

588
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,960
course delivers to the to request to the

589
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,480
actual uh name server of the of the c2

590
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,279
domain and then this e2 domain is is

591
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,440
trying to decrypt the payload and if it

592
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,159
can

593
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,799
uh decrypt the payload it will ask

594
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,360
answer the uh

595
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,400
either the comment a command it wants to

596
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,679
execute on the system or okay and if not

597
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,159
it will uh not answer anything anything

598
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,480
as it it can cannot decrypt the uh

599
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,159
decrypt the uh

600
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,559
payload uh the floor descending to

601
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,159
uh here's an example of the query so

602
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,320
as i said there will be the legit uh

603
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,760
dns over https service provider then

604
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,679
session session id uh see a number of

605
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,159
the uh

606
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,480
request and then if it's sending or

607
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,200
receiving data on the next request then

608
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,039
there will be the uh base 32 encoded

609
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,080
blob

610
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,720
and then the actual actual c2 host and

611
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,919
request type is always txt so it's

612
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,240
always requesting the txt from the from

613
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,360
the host

614
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,520
flowbot has a lot of different

615
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,559
capabilities here are the comments which

616
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,600
it can execute on the system a few

617
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,559
points

618
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,080
i want to

619
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,880
show

620
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,360
is the socks connection so basically the

621
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,679
user the attacker can

622
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,559
have active connection to the phone

623
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:46,720
uh also it can send sms and also

624
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,080
show in yet which are the uh actual the

625
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,360
uh uh

626
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,279
fizzing payloads which i will show you

627
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,760
you know in a moment

628
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,080
but not all system languages are equal

629
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,279
so uh

630
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,039
as many malware this malware is not

631
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,360
targeting uh countries which use acrylic

632
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,799
alphabets

633
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,000
so

634
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,720
here are the countries which are not

635
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,240
targeted there is russian and some other

636
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,080
countries which are

637
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,600
near russia and if we can see the trend

638
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,840
we can see that uh most

639
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,720
part of the east is not targeted by flu

640
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,760
but

641
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,880
so which countries are then targeted

642
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,679
based on the country codes

643
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,320
the fluba tries to send sms

644
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,200
these are the countries are taught which

645
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,840
are targeted i have seen

646
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,000
information that there has been samples

647
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,919
that have been targeted

648
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,480
targeting also new zealand australia and

649
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,840
japan but i haven't seen those samples

650
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,880
with my own eyes so i didn't put them on

651
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,720
this map but these are like 100

652
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,679
uh

653
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,919
surely the countries that have been

654
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,640
targeted or will be targeted by the flow

655
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,880
but

656
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,600
the goal

657
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,240
well they have financial goal uh they

658
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,799
are using fishing overlays uh we have

659
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,080
seen uh

660
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,480
these uh in in the previous versions we

661
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,520
have seen like uh big uh european banks

662
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,039
as targets

663
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,640
but uh the recent versions are targeting

664
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,440
uh

665
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,480
gmail coinbase and binance

666
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,880
and by the way these screenshots are

667
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,880
just the screenshots of

668
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,600
html pages and these atm html pages also

669
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,320
had comments in them and these comments

670
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,399
were written in russia

671
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,279
so

672
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,080
that's

673
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,559
i'm not saying that's an attribution but

674
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,159
i'm just saying that there were some

675
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,720
russian texts included as a comment in

676
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,880
this html inject

677
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,399
so let's make a conclusion

678
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,840
the threat actor doesn't

679
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,440
want

680
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,840
systems with keryllic alphabets to be

681
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,880
to be

682
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,320
infected

683

the c2 in phrase hosted in russia

684
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,399

686
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,679

687
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,480
was sharing russian propaganda uh this

688
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,520

690
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,559
motivation unclear a lot of capabilities

691
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,960
but but

692
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,120
we can just prove that they are

693
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,678
interested financially about the victims

694
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,520
and as i said no attribution but

695
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,120
i just want this to sink in uh sometimes

696
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,159
duck is a duck and uh so on i'm not

697
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,159
saying that that this is this is a duck

698
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,880
