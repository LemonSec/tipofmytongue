2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,680
welcome everybody my name is boris and i

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,599
will share the screen

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,160
so we are all on the same page and those

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,400
who would not be able to attend

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,960
potentially would be able to

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,039
have this presentation

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,240
uh reviewed

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,960
welcome and i do appreciate your

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,680
attendance my name is boris

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,480
my co-presenter paul dixie dr paul dixie

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,840
who is a ceo of farsight security

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,239
may or may not be able to attend

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,200
but

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
we would be able to handle it and if you

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,399
have some questions to paul directly

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,160
he would be happy to answer

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,719
a little bit about me and paul uh i am

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,640
sure that you had our little bios read

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,199
on the uh website

21
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,280
from uh from the first

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,239
so therefore i will not talk about us uh

23
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,440
a lot

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,840
if you want to learn more you just

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,200
google uh

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,680
paul or me and i'm happy to accept your

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,479
linkedin invites so with that

28
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,439
we will start to talk about protective

29
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,680
dns

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,360
why it matters

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,720
how to deploy it on prem

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,119
and how to take control

33
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,040
and defense back into your hands

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,600
i'm sure uh during the course of the

35
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,240
this conference or any other uh you

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,280
probably uh heard a lot about different

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,840
solutions about different methods

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,799
and

39
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,439
very often when i do hear this kind of

40
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,399
uh

41
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,360
stuff

42
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,079
uh

43
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,920
it always occurs to me that a very very

44
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,799
strong underlying assumption is being

45
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,560
put in place

46
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
we put this solution

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,360
and only if the adversary just walk

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,079
through this the adversary will

49
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,439
be dropped in our in our trap will fall

50
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,239
in our trap and i also were thinking why

51
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,319
would adversary go

52
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,280
adversary's uh objective is not go and

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,599
fall into your drop adversary's

54
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,440
objectives is to avoid any trap possible

55
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,239
so if we agree on that

56
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,640
then the fundamental question would be

57
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,560
is there anything hey boris oh there yes

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,400
sorry to interrupt you you need to make

59
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,160
your screen full we can see some of your

60
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,680
desktop icons

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,440
oh you see it

62
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,440
uh that's on purpose but i'm happy to

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,680
make it bigger is it better okay yeah

64
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,120
that's better if it's on purpose it's up

65
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,920
to you

66
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,959
okay so uh yes i'm fine if you see some

67
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,480
of the icons

68
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,360
but yeah let's do it bigger so where was

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,480
i i was asking myself a question uh is

70
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,000
there anything

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,840
we can find which would not depend on

72
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,800
our assumption just go this way and we

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,360
will we will catch you

74
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,800
and apparently there are things so with

75
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,480
that this is what we will be talking

76
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,040
today about there are many

77
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,640
many

78
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,440
uh cloud dns solutions and cloud dns

79
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,400
providers

80
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,280
dns is one of the fundamental protocol

81
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,799
open dns dns filter cloud flare code 9

82
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,360
and all the different squads

83
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,040
code 1 code 2 code 4 code 8 whatever you

84
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,280
want to see it right

85
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,080
and they

86
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,560
claim they provide some filtering

87
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,760
where they understand your request

88
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,280
or answer and based on that

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,239
whatever they believe is dangerous

90
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,799
will answer what we call dishonesty

91
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,200
and it was done on purpose

92
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,560
because if something is not desirable

93
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,439
whatever the policy is perhaps it is a

94
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,120
good for you and for your constitution

95
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,000
constituency not to go there

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,879
because a lot of harm we know comes from

97
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,200
the internet

98
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,079
it comes to the point that uh in the u.s

99
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,798
for example uh earlier this year in

100
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,560
march it was a directive from the

101
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,360
president biden as well as from

102
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,960
different cyber defense bodies

103
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,479
which

104
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,080
encourage businesses and public to use

105
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,000
what they adopt as

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,120
protective dns

107
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,000
interestingly enough they only mentioned

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,120
cloud-based solutions

109
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,880
it's not only us which came up with

110
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,840
with this notion earlier this year in uk

111
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,440
for example where i am today

112
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,840
uh this function can uh goes back to

113
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,840
2017.

114
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,600
so notion of protective dns comes to sun

115
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
uh 17

116
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,440
2017 and it still is not available for

117
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,639
private sector we will touch on that so

118
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,160
this is kind of a problem a statement

119
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,919
and the

120
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,159
the furthermore we can say that

121
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,000
if you don't have a contractual uh

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,320
relationship with your third party

123
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,919
provider

124
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,840
some people could accept that but some

125
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,600
businesses especially may not

126
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,840
necessarily

127
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,440
and when you owe softness to the cloud

128
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,639
we claim

129
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,919
you basically lose the control of your

130
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,560
environment

131
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,120
and what you will be talking today would

132
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,639
be what we call dns firewall or rpg

133
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,360
response policy zone

134
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,440
and this was a

135
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,800
an engine

136
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,120
and being used in dns filtering policy

137
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,360
so in this presentation

138
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,759
i will cover the motifs

139
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,800
methods

140
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
and context

141
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,680
to justify on premise protective dns

142
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,000
not only i would do that i will show you

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,960
how exactly you can build it by yourself

144
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,280
so if i can do it with you during the

145
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,120
second part of this presentation second

146
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,800
hour in literally in 10-15 minutes

147
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,199
you would definitely understand that the

148
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,840
same power you can take in your hands

149
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,880
bring to your organizations and use

150
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,160
everything which comes as a byproduct

151
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,000
with this dns defense

152
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,680
all right

153
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,599
let's talk a little bit about dns if

154
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,000
you're not much familiar with this

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,560
that is fine because you don't need to

156
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,319
you go you open your browser you type

157
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,039
google and you go oh whatever you uh you

158
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,759
like and this is how you internet life

159
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,400
might start maybe not yours but majority

160
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,680
of people

161
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,759
in the cyber space

162
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,919
so dns was invented in 1986

163
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,639
by dr paul mccapetris dr

164
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,720
paul mccarpetris

165
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,800
is a

166
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,599
board member of farsight security so

167
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,120
inventor of dns is part of farsight

168
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,759
security

169
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,080
it was designed

170
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,280
as a highly distributed system

171
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,000
for reliability

172
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,879
i would like you to think about it

173
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,240
it was designed as a highly distributed

174
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,560
system

175
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,280
why i try to emphasize this for you

176
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,039
for very simple reason

177
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,599
because if you use something

178
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,479
outside of its design purpose

179
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,599
it will

180
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,680
fail

181
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,960
it may work nicely but it will

182
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,039
fail

183
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,479
when i serve a

184
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,199
army uh we heard the joke lieutenant

185
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,800
comes to the captain and asks hey

186
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,759
captain

187
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,360
uh sir uh can tanks fly

188
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,960
and captain sail

189
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,840
are you stupid how tanks can fly of

190
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,800
course tanks don't fly and lieutenant

191
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,680
says well general said that tanks can

192
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,720
fly

193
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,880
and the capitan says well

194
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,279
maybe not very very far

195
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,760
so yes tanks can fly but not very very

196
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,559
far if you don't still believe me that

197
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,479
if you use something outside of a design

198
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,080
purpose it would fail

199
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,600
look at recent uh disappearance of the

200
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,920
facebook for example okay

201
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,160
one typo somewhere from the home office

202
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,000
in the basement made facebook

203
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,279
disappeared

204
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,080
look at other uh

205
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,640
fundamental and

206
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,839
glorious fiascos of the concentrated

207
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:06,880
cloud

208
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,399
solutions

209
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,120
if something is used outside of design

210
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,839
purpose it will fail so if you rely on

211
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,640
something that is very concentrated and

212
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,480
at the same time was designed to be

213
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,120
distributed for reliability

214
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,839
and a high availability

215
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,279
you just expect that some day

216
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,920
the failure will reach you

217
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,440
dearly

218
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,920
so dns is a fundamental protocol the

219
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,720
same way as pgp

220
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,680
and

221
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,240
your life in internet starts with this

222
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,040
too

223
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,200
first you need to understand

224
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,360
where you need to go

225
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,680
and then the gpu will take over

226
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,800
actually

227
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,040
bring you there

228
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,760
so one is a an address book and another

229
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,920
one is a road map

230
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,720
who controls dns and bgp control the

231
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,839
internet once again think of facebook

232
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,120
recently within couple of last months

233
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,519
so if you

234
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,160
cannot fully control bgp

235
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,839
but if your autonomous system is a

236
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,560
system then you actually control that

237
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,120
but if somebody had juxt you then you

238
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,519
probably out of that control that is

239
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,160
fundamental point to think but you

240
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,680
actually can

241
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,600
take control about

242
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,640
naming

243
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,399
in your own hands

244
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,040
so you don't rely on cloud solutions but

245
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,519
you can do it yourself and the argument

246
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,920
we usually think uh here

247
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,760
is that okay

248
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,800
uh

249
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,000
we need skills we need we need expertise

250
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,440
to run that and what about uh

251
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,320
what about reliability well at home i

252
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,880
run two dns recursive servers they're

253
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
both running on

254
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,120
raspberry pi

255
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,720
of course you don't need to use

256
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,640
raspberry pi if you have hundred

257
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,079
thousand

258
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,720
people organization but there are many

259
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,040
other solutions which i would touch on

260
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,000
right

261
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,720
once again it is highly distributed by

262
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
design

263
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,200
that was its purpose

264
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,240
and those who controlled dns and bgp

265
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,959
would control the cyberspace

266
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,320
and i would like

267
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,279
you to take that control and everything

268
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,600
which comes as a byproduct

269
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,760
a little bit about firewalls because

270
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,920
this is something that you would need to

271
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,160
link together

272
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,720
firewalls before the internet was

273
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,800
trusted environment

274
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,680
uh people knew each other and then it

275
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,320
grew up exponentially and now we see

276
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,480
what we have

277
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,880
and

278
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,240
fundamentally it appears that no matter

279
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,880
what we do

280
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,480
we cannot achieve the security in fact

281
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,560
you cannot prove security positive there

282
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,440
is no test which you can devise to

283
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,000
demonstrate that some system is actually

284
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,079
secure

285
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,000
you only can demonstrate that something

286
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,200
is insecure because you could break it

287
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,320
but if

288
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,720
no matter how hard you try you couldn't

289
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,920
break it

290
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,320
the question about security

291
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,480
remains opened so that's why we tend to

292
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,279
uh

293
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,279
take the

294
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,160
to take the analogy of the physical

295
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,279
world

296
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,760
into digital one so we invented the

297
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,120
firewalls

298
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,920
here are them

299
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,160
and here are us

300
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,720
and even that doesn't work much right

301
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,000
because you are assuming that you know

302
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,200
what

303
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,360
they only need to go through this trap

304
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,680
and then we will catch them well they

305
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,079
don't need to go through that trap and

306
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,440
the firewall is a hole in the wall

307
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,720
you understand that right so when i was

308
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,760
uh 20 something years younger

309
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,920
over the lab connection i was able to

310
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,200
map internal networks of my company

311
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,760
we didn't call it red team at that time

312
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,680
but i was able to map the internal

313
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,160
network of my company being outside of

314
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,600
the firewall on the dial up link so what

315
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,839
i would like to say is should you have

316
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,440
some knowledge and a little bit of

317
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,480
motivation firewall is not the deterrent

318
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,600
but

319
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,680
firewall concept is very important

320
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,959
because it does enforce policy between

321
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,959
us and them

322
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,680
okay so i'm sure you understand that

323
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,959
again what i say is extremely simplified

324
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,320
but i don't want to make it so

325
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,959
complicated that you fall asleep i would

326
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,000
like you to be encouraged by what i say

327
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,320
i see a couple of chat

328
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,639
messages here let me check whether there

329
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,279
are questions or not

330
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,760
we need to use presentation mode this is

331
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,880
to me

332
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,279
and this is please yes okay so

333
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,120
everything is for you

334
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,160
uh to follow and i did the presentation

335
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,959
more i need to look at the left side uh

336
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,199
grace because you know

337
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,560
i need to remember what i would be

338
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,440
talking about before and make this

339
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,519
slides flow nicer

340
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,320
okay

341
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,959
talking about nice flaw let's talk about

342
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,880
something that i already mentioned

343
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,320
several times so protective dns

344
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,839
uk government since 2017 u.s government

345
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,480
till uh from uh uh 2021

346
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,040
uh other governments in the world also

347
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,320
follow that so everyone now calls it a

348
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,800
protective dns but what exactly that is

349
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,959
uh i don't want you to believe that this

350
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:49,920
is some

351
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,480
another kind of term invented it is

352
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,560
invented term but

353
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,120
it has something that we can actually

354
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,199
define and describe

355
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,880
for example unlike

356
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,800
i don't know zero trust if you ask

357
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,440
somebody what is zero trust instead of

358
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,760
telling you what it is because nobody

359
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,800
knows

360
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,000
they tell

361
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,880
what it does based on their opinion

362
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,680
right you may you may try so ask

363
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,399
somebody who pretends to be a zero trust

364
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,399
expert and ask what is zero trust and

365
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,920
they say for me zero trust does this

366
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,959
or instead they say for me zero trust is

367
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,519
and now it is the long description what

368
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,759
it does if you cannot describe something

369
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,000
or define something in i don't know

370
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,399
three five lines of text

371
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,360
conveying the reason that of that

372
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,000
existence that means something is

373
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,880
fundamentally wrong with that to get

374
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,360
protective dns there is nothing wrong

375
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,440
here protective dns it's usually an

376
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,199
umbrella term

377
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,240
which defines a security solution which

378
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,160
simply examines dns queries and answers

379
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,160
based on the name and destination

380
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,959
addresses and enforces the policy

381
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,440
whether to let it go

382
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,560
or not let it go

383
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,959
and when we say

384
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,759
policy it all depends on how you define

385
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,000
your own policy whether it is malicious

386
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
content whether there is no desirable

387
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,199
content

388
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,519
whether it is something else

389
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,639
right so once again protective dns

390
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,680
it's a

391
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,360
set of security solutions that use dns

392
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,240
as an engine right as an engine

393
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,759
to

394
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,440
respond

395
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
based on the policy it's a policy

396
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,160
enforcement device same as a firewall so

397
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,360
protective dns in another world what we

398
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,920
learned from many many many years ago i

399
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,199
think it was

400
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,360
back to

401
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,000
2010 when uh engine of uh uh

402
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,639
dns firewall was invented

403
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,160
by dixie and schneider uh we call it

404
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,800
dns firewall exactly the device which

405
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,839
enforces policy us and them us and them

406
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,119
good or bad and good or bad is based on

407
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,319
the judgment and judgment based on your

408
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,839
policy

409
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,799
okay

410
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,640
so that's what uh

411
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,280
protective dns is okay let's talk a

412
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,520
little bit more about protective dns so

413
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,160
how exactly that is being done

414
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,799
first of all

415
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,440
you if you use dns you definitely

416
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,039
understand

417
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,799
questions and answers

418
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,120
almost everything starts with dns right

419
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,840
you start your journey on the internet

420
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,480
you don't remember

421
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,679
ips

422
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,600
not to mention ipv6 but even ipv4 uh

423
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,480
only

424
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,440
if you assist admin but even if you uh

425
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,600
go through the browser and your regular

426
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,320
user almost everything starts with that

427
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
your toaster i don't know your watch

428
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,880
your your fridge

429
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,160
they would reach a dns server okay

430
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,360
so what do

431
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,200
bots and any other malicious uh uh wear

432
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,080
on your system

433
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,600
now understanding those requests okay

434
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
questions okay

435
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,360
and potential answers

436
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,640
would in many cases prevent that

437
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,600
malicious flaw and i will show you uh

438
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,720
those

439
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,320
things okay

440
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,440
and

441
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,799
that

442
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,880
could prevent

443
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,440
a lot of badness on the internet so i

444
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,000
say that and i would like to back up my

445
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,840
uh

446
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,760
my statements by some facts there have

447
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,160
been a lot of studies done

448
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,000
okay including those at far side

449
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,200
security

450
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,640
uh we observed the internet on dns since

451
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,440
2010 and we have a large database going

452
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,000
back into the history and we observe

453
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,160
those domains and how internet from

454
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,640
domain naming perspectives is evolving

455
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,440
we did the studies what we found was

456
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,360
that if a domain

457
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,400
is about to die in one week

458
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,200
most likely it would be block listed

459
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,520
in the first hour 50

460
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,960
of those

461
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,080
another 80 percent would be within 24

462
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,039
hours so if you are about to die in one

463
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,400
week

464
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,440
in one day eighty percent of those right

465
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,679
eighty percent of those would disappear

466
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,760
through block listing so they could be

467
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,840
there but if you are in a block list of

468
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,679
some reputable vendor

469
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,960
most likely for you it's a it's a doom

470
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,000
day so so your domain just doesn't exist

471
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,919
because a lot of technologies including

472
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,240
regular firewalls would use those block

473
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,240
lists

474
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,520
as the question is what you're going to

475
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,440
do in between between when something

476
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,919
appears on the internet and somebody

477
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,600
would understand whether it's good or

478
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,960
bad so that is the window opportunity

479
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,840
for

480
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,880
uh for for the criminals nation states

481
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,480
uh organized crime

482
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,520
and everyone who has malicious intent

483
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,840
this is not the only one

484
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,320
not the only kind of use case but it is

485
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,880
very very

486
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,200
prevalent on the on the internet there

487
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,799
are many we can touch on those as well

488
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,400
another study mentioned uh that up to

489
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,679
eighty percent on newly uh new assets on

490
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,240
the internet are not safe to deal with

491
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,520
business with

492
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,159
up to 70 percent some other studies

493
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,039
quoted up to 90 percent

494
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,039
okay so i would say if you

495
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,559
say between 60 and 90 percent

496
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,039
of the assets new assets on the internet

497
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,799
are not safe

498
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,200
you would not make a terrible mistake

499
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,840
okay so 60 to 90 it's uh you say 75 plus

500
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,559
minus 15 percent well very good

501
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,880
experiments in physics when you try to

502
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,919
do it uh kind of manually uh may have

503
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,720
this kind of uh error margin if you talk

504
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,440
about medicine probably uh almost the

505
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,360
same uh

506
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,559
very precise

507
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,000
studies are very very expensive so

508
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,200
the 70

509
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,360
is the figure you need to keep in mind

510
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,559
plus minus 10 15 percent error imagine

511
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,559
okay for new assets what we also know

512
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,120
from the study is that up to 90 percent

513
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,799
of malware

514
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,240
use dns for the communication

515
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,840
up to 90

516
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,480
so now the picture is getting quite

517
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,360
clear

518
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,880
so if you control the dns a fundamental

519
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
protocol of the internet

520
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,360
you would be able to control

521
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,000
the badness

522
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,440
or maybe you would not control the

523
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
badness you would control the goodness

524
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
you would control

525
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,880
the way your environment

526
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,120
would be trying to be tricked by the

527
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,919
malicious actors to go somewhere which

528
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,919
is not safe

529
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,440
remarkably

530
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,640
another study says up to 70 percent and

531
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,520
i believe the precise figure was 68

532
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,120
i don't like 68 thing right it tells

533
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,600
usually that it was measured with such

534
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,919
preciseness which in this particular

535
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,200
case uh is impossible to do so i would

536
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,159
say up to 70 percent of organizations do

537
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,600
not monitor dns traffic so if dns

538
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,120
fundamental protocol when you don't

539
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,840
monitor it

540
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,919
then then a lot of investments you're

541
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,400
actually doing pretending to have a

542
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,679
compliance program and cyber defense

543
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,400
program uh i would say

544
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,440
uh may not be really

545
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,000
sufficient or useful okay

546
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,679
you can start with something which is

547
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,080
very simple and powerful fundamental

548
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,720
things and then you can go on a

549
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,000
peripheries uh uh of your defenses if

550
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,640
you actually know what what that is and

551
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,400
now the dns observations it's a data

552
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,120
data which do not lie it's not

553
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,440
speculations you see something and you

554
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,919
understand this observations is the

555
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,960
accurate measurement

556
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,080
okay

557
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,039
that is about dns but everything would

558
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,360
be cool if we didn't know anything

559
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,240
what mr snowden shared with the world

560
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,000
and now what we have is a lot of very

561
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,960
unconsidered solutions very powerful

562
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,559
though

563
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,159
have been popping up here and there

564
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,960
not only they pop up pretending to

565
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,640
defend you or your privacy

566
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,159
they specifically design to impede the

567
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,240
security

568
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,120
okay so people believe okay either you

569
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,159
have privacy or security and i would say

570
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,799
you can have both but if you design

571
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,000
something

572
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,440
to specifically impede the security you

573
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,039
will

574
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,679
for example dns over http encrypted

575
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,360
client hello quick etc etc etc they are

576
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,159
specifically designed to circumvent

577
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,799
security controls

578
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,080
so now you pretend to advocate for

579
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,200
privacy but at the same time you impede

580
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,080
something that may enforce the privacy

581
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,400
of your communication

582
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,799
so and i would suggest that this is

583
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,080
actually a very interesting uh

584
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,360
topic to debate right there are uh

585
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,720
serious uh

586
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,440
advocates on both sides

587
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,080
one want to have encryption everywhere

588
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,039
and

589
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,760
others say you know what then we can

590
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,600
just go home because he wouldn't

591
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,159
be able to protect you

592
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,679
because if you got compromised through

593
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,799
that very secure encrypted channel

594
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,279
your adversary on another side would

595
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,159
know everything what you are doing

596
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,840
from the channel which we cannot even

597
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,120
look into

598
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,559
we cannot protect you

599
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,039
from those you want to be protected from

600
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,760
this is something

601
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,360
as a topic for

602
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,720
for uh for for for another for another

603
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,200
day but what i would like to say just

604
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,559
think about it

605
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,440
and whether what you do

606
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,880
with this

607
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,120
privacy so-called solutions

608
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,360
would help you

609
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,320
to respond to the incidents because that

610
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,720
is what you're passionate about this is

611
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,760
why you are here and this is why

612
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,640
we are talking about it

613
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,159
all right with this let's talk a little

614
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,159
bit more about protective dns

615
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,240
if it is not bypassed

616
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,799
it's a fantastic and very powerful

617
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,840
instrument for you

618
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,200
your end point with the server

619
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,520
in your data center or toaster in your

620
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,360
kitchen

621
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,200
we believe

622
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,400
we need to assume might be compromised

623
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,640
already

624
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,520
and if it is compromised it is not under

625
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,360
your control

626
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,279
what is

627
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,159
well

628
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,360
if adversary wanted to do something

629
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,440
they would need to use two fundamental

630
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,640
protocols whether they want it or not

631
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,320
they would need to use dns and bgp right

632
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,159
to come and go

633
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,039
and they need to know where to go to

634
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:53,840
so

635
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,799
they would reach dns server so now if

636
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,400
you understand

637
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,760
what the dns server responding to your

638
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,799
environment you would be able to to pick

639
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:05,600
up

640
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,400
very

641
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,960
very yearly signals

642
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,520
uh in your uh jargon professionals are

643
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,799
going to be

644
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,320
we call it ioc indicators of compromise

645
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,279
and i argue that it is too late

646
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,440
indicator of compromise is when

647
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,279
something is already broken

648
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,880
i would

649
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,600
argue that we can offer you indicators

650
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,039
of attack

651
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,840
when nothing

652
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,880
yet been compromised how beautiful that

653
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,480
is you operate in a in a concept of the

654
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,440
kill chain you believe that everything

655
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,320
starts with the reconnaissance

656
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,960
and i argue that it is not

657
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,600
and the reason for this is very simple

658
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,799
of billions of targets on internet

659
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,640
an adversary would want to target you

660
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,960
to do the reconnaissance

661
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,159
it has been a lot of thinking done

662
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,399
before the target was chosen

663
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,960
before you see those signals yearly

664
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,679
signals of scanning etc etc etc

665
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,720
adversary has scarce resources

666
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,039
some may have greater resources than you

667
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,760
do but they are not unlimited

668
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,919
they make those decisions before they do

669
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,039
recall

670
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,840
let's see how we can move left over the

671
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,640
kill chain and see whether it is even

672
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,320
possible

673
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,600
for that i need to give you a little bit

674
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,799
a next course uh of the dns architecture

675
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,039
remember i mentioned it's uh is highly

676
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,840
distributed and if you try to use it

677
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,919
centralized

678
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,159
uh then uh one way or another it will be

679
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,720
broken it was not designed for this it

680
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,880
wasn't a design that the whole world

681
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,600
would go to school with

682
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,640
some

683
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,760
dns server because once it's dead

684
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,080
everything is dead because there's sort

685
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,080
of many

686
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,240
who would provide the answer

687
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,399
and there's sort of many who would ask

688
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,440
questions and this is a focal point

689
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,039
and that focal point is not by design

690
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,360
it is by financial interest

691
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,440
and if you believe otherwise raise your

692
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,279
hand and we can have a little discussion

693
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,559
here but how it works on the right

694
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,039
corner at the bottom this is the

695
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,679
question this is your kids this is your

696
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,159
boss this is yourself your fridge a

697
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,760
toaster whatever that could be and they

698
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,200
ask a stub resolver so dns demon on your

699
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,159
system

700
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,720
which would go and ask recursive dns

701
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,679
what we call full resolver

702
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,320
now between stub resolver and recursive

703
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,440
dns

704
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,360
server which would go across the

705
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,760
internet and fetch the answer for you if

706
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,799
that answer is not already in cache

707
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,360
previously done so okay

708
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,039
the recursive dns server would see the

709
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,880
pii

710
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,600
okay so now just imagine just an engine

711
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,840
right

712
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,360
people talk about uh privacy all right

713
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,559
so they do encryption

714
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,960
but they ask some

715
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,279
non-contracted party on the internet

716
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,600
which would know who you are

717
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,360
okay so how private that could be

718
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,399
yes nobody on a in the middle would be

719
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,760
able to see what is being asked

720
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,480
but how would you trust your cloud dns

721
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,559
provider

722
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,600
not being under control of the adversary

723
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,200
you try to hide in the first place

724
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,519
if you run your own recourse of the

725
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,519
server that pii the ip mac addresses in

726
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,600
some cases it depends how your network

727
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,519
is being constructed

728
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,279
will not be linked to the internet if

729
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,880
properly set up

730
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,559
so your recursive will go to different

731
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,440
authority servers and bring the answer

732
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,960
to you

733
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,600
the only server would know what was

734
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,480
asked would be the authoritative server

735
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,960
of the final destination

736
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,600
but because there are so many of those

737
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,679
you would be reaching

738
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,720
right there is no central authority that

739
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
would connect the data about your

740
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,840
questions

741
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,760
even though those questions are not

742
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,320
encrypted

743
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,919
i'm an architect there's always

744
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,120
trade-off

745
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,440
and you would decide which exact

746
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,519
solution you would want to have

747
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,399
i let it think uh sink in your mind a

748
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,159
little bit and i check

749
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,240
what is here all good yes thank you

750
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,279
grace

751
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,360
with your help i guess we are

752
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,279
progressing uh well

753
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,200
okay so this is how you have the control

754
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,320
okay

755
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,679
and

756
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:06,880
this

757
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,559
how you also have a protection

758
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,519
there are two additional protocols in

759
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,559
dns i'll touch on them as well which

760
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,279
provides you not only control but

761
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,399
protection so recursive dns server

762
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,320
you can collect the observation for

763
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,919
analysis

764
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,559
and then you create a rpg which is

765
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,399
response policy zone

766
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,080
and you ask your recursive dns to answer

767
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,760
certain queries the way you want it

768
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,000
it could be nx domain not existing

769
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,279
domain it could be 120 7001

770
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,360
to sync the communication

771
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,519
so now you don't need firewalls you

772
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,600
don't need anything else

773
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,919
if let's say your environment

774
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,640
let's say you received an email okay you

775
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,200
click on the link or maybe not you maybe

776
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,840
one of you 100 000 employees in your

777
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,799
organization click on the link and that

778
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,399
domain was recently popped up and uh

779
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,360
user actually reached that uh

780
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,279
destination and it was

781
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,880
situ a ransomware distribution key

782
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,159
center

783
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,880
all right in 15 minutes you have it

784
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,519
spread laterally and you're gone

785
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,760
so your firewall may not necessarily be

786
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,760
able to handle millions and millions of

787
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,799
rules

788
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,320
but the dns has been designed for that

789
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,919
so you can hand on my raspberry pi on my

790
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,919
raspberry pi i handle over 10 million

791
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,279
rules

792
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,519
through our pc i will show you how to

793
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,519
have it okay

794
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,880
and i have no

795
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,960
degradation of services now if i'm in a

796
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,360
large organization i may have something

797
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,240
bigger than that i may build my own dns

798
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,760
server on as powerful hardware as i can

799
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,559
but

800
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,279
at par if your firewall is running on a

801
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,720
the a hardware for the dns

802
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,399
would be outperforming in others

803
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,480
any firewall

804
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,679
based on rules

805
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,119
and now you have control and protection

806
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,879
should you run your own recursive dns

807
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,639
but this is the problem

808
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,359
this is how you lose your control

809
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,000
because now every application every

810
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,359
browser or any or most

811
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,480
are trying to use their own recursive

812
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,000
dns

813
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,040
and they speak radioh

814
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,399
dns over https so they basically

815
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,399
designed to circumvent any of your

816
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,159
defenses

817
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,679
at times without control of your user or

818
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,839
yourself

819
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:52,960
so now

820
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,679
if your system is being compromised by

821
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,720
those who you try to hide from

822
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,800
then all your environment

823
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,960
would also be compromised

824
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,800
we know how it's going on right you're

825
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,040
an incident response and we should

826
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,200
assume that it uh

827
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,280
it could happen and it does it is

828
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,800
happening

829
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,920
so now

830
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,599
this is what what we are now facing

831
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,560
at the moment this kind of uh

832
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,000
uh scenario

833
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,480
is quite dangerous uh not only for home

834
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,079
small offices but for large

835
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,000
organizations as well

836
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,280
and

837
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,680
yeah the the next notion or at least the

838
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,400
pressure uh is growing uh towards

839
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,079
revealing where those uh recursive uh uh

840
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,200
speaking hosts are so big organization

841
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,680
security focused and security aware

842
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,119
would

843
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,599
stop those communication at the firewall

844
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:48,800
at ip

845
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,320
level

846
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,560
now why it has happened

847
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,839
well one can argue continue to argue

848
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:00,480
about the privacy okay but

849
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,000
who controls the dns control the

850
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,560
internet is fundamental protocol so

851
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,800
somebody wants you to use them as their

852
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,520
dns provider

853
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,839
how that could be private

854
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,480
yes they offer encrypted channel but you

855
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,560
don't form any contractual obligation

856
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,720
with that subparty

857
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,598
how that could be private

858
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,119
i will not argue this case but i would

859
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,760
like you to actually think about this

860
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,960
because it's very very important

861
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,160
now let's take a little bit a little bit

862
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,640
maybe not on tangent but on something

863
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,280
that also will help us build the case

864
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,560
for motivation and uh reasons to use

865
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,160
your own uh

866
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,440
your own private your own private

867
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,079
recursive dns okay so it's part of the

868
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,960
design of the distributed infrastructure

869
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,640
only you

870
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,880
who runs the private uh

871
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,520
recourse of dns with cpii of your

872
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,680
constituency the

873
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,079
personally identifiable information like

874
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,480
ips etc okay

875
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,160
and

876
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,320
participating in the

877
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,520
in the

878
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,560
distributed environment it was exactly

879
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,720
how it was designed and

880
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,280
matured over the years

881
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,240
so now

882
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,359
now

883
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,599
let's take a look at how we deal with

884
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:28,960
badness

885
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,119
uh many are very proud that they do take

886
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,720
downs

887
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,160
when i worked for a largest uk bank here

888
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,680
in london

889
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,240
uh our best time was near 24 hours okay

890
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,359
so you remember we had the study that

891
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,440
said that

892
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,800
if something is bad and about to die

893
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,119
because of the block listing right in

894
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,200
one week

895
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,040
eighty percent of those would be block

896
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,440
listed in a day

897
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,320
okay

898
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,520
but then

899
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,400
in the between you still need to do

900
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,880
something and you don't know what to do

901
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,800
because all your technologies still

902
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,480
don't know

903
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,880
right so now in 24 hours you will

904
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,520
take down something but statistically

905
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,000
it's useless because it's already

906
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,400
most of them are block listed so you

907
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,599
spend effort on something which is not

908
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,560
very effective okay you probably have a

909
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,880
team you spend money you know

910
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,960
you say how good you are

911
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,680
and you're doing practically a useless

912
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,440
thing

913
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,280
on average

914
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,520
statistically okay

915
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,760
because all the badness happens in

916
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,760
between

917
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,480
there are studies done that criminals

918
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,560
when they pop up on the internet they

919
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,599
rip the uh the fruits of their labor in

920
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,760
a first several hours

921
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,640
okay so something popped up they ripped

922
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,400
the benefits then started a block

923
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,839
listing here and then you go and you uh

924
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,560
take it down

925
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,280
but it's not necessary because that is

926
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,160
already mostly abundant or you will say

927
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,119
uh reputational perspectives yes perhaps

928
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,800
this is very strong argument you don't

929
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,520
want to have your brand infringement

930
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,359
somewhere on the internet but please

931
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,160
don't tell this is for security reason

932
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,119
because you ask the budget for security

933
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,599
but in fact use it for something else

934
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,440
and if you use something

935
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
outside of its design purpose it will

936
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,839
fail so maybe your boss is sitting on

937
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,079
this meeting next time we'll ask you

938
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,079
exactly the same question they will not

939
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,400
give you the budget for that so be

940
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,280
honest and understand the evolution of

941
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,960
badness and how we can better

942
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,160
uh

943
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,599
distribute our defenses because our uh

944
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,079
resources are scarce so

945
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,680
far end the takedowns

946
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,400
long time lack of cooperation and

947
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,680
basically it doesn't work as effectively

948
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,919
as many in industry try to present

949
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,160
okay it works in some cases but if you

950
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,720
take the average

951
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,440
and randomly pick it up

952
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,280
it's pretty useless

953
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,040
and it's useless for the reasons i

954
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,200
already described this is not what i

955
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,400
come up with

956
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,800
just before this meeting to convince you

957
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,119
these are the studies which

958
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,200
if you reach me out i give you the

959
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,640
reference okay for those it was done by

960
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,200
vendors it was done by non-vendors it

961
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,880
was done by

962
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,040
academics so

963
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,520
they on average because they they

964
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,359
consider different data cells during

965
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,160
different times etc so they're not the

966
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,160
same it's not like physics you drop the

967
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,319
ball and here's your g right 9.8

968
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,599
but

969
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,560
on average whenever you look see it's

970
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,319
like universe right whenever you look on

971
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,040
average you see the same uh uh white

972
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,839
noise which are things coming from the

973
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,240
big bang right if you if you believe in

974
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,200
science

975
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,079
right so that's what it is if on average

976
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,400
you look at the internet those spots of

977
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,760
badness have approximately the same

978
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,839
average figures

979
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:29,520
okay let's talk about now uh near hand

980
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,839
your

981
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,920
endpoint defenses i don't know antivirus

982
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,480
whatever that is right

983
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,640
it's not cost effective

984
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,720
if let's say you have an organization of

985
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,400
100 000 users okay and if you buy a

986
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,960
license for antivirus for 50 bucks

987
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,359
this may eat your

988
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,640
a large chunk of your of your security

989
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,839
budget

990
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,160
right and there's so many things need to

991
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,040
be done and in fact in fact if you take

992
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,920
a new code and put it on wireless total

993
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,880
you know

994
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,560
what happened right

995
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,720
most of the time for weeks and months uh

996
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,960
the malicious code which just encrypted

997
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,599
your system right uh

998
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,920
couldn't be recognized by uh by an army

999
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,440
of antivirus

1000
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,960
i don't wanna you know spoil your parade

1001
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,359
what i would like to see is

1002
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,880
it is

1003
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,800
high cost

1004
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,400
and benefit is yet to be

1005
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,280
realized so cost benefit analysis i am

1006
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,040
an architect i would like to do some

1007
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,079
optimization how would i optimize can i

1008
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,880
run my system without antivirus

1009
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,800
i can

1010
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,520
okay because i understand perhaps how to

1011
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,640
run it can an average user run this

1012
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,119
without antivirus perhaps

1013
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,440
but you would need to educate those

1014
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,400
users and perhaps that would be

1015
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,400
better than having an antivirus which

1016
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,160
wouldn't recognize the malicious code

1017
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,200
anyway

1018
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,160
right it is a debatable thing and we can

1019
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,319
take it offline if you like

1020
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,599
or go to my linkedin profile and have a

1021
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,440
look at couple of articles i have

1022
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,480
written there or maybe my blog post etc

1023
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,640
and if you have some

1024
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,280
strong argument for that let's debate it

1025
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,000
i think it's time our industry is in

1026
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,640
crisis okay we come up with some crazy

1027
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,040
ideas which don't work by time of uh

1028
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,079
implementation uh uh the solution is

1029
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,720
already obsolete and we need to have

1030
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,560
something

1031
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,960
and that something is understanding what

1032
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,880
is actually going on

1033
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,520
and that's why at the very beginning i

1034
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,640
mentioned

1035
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,560
let's use fundamental thing the things

1036
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,040
which cannot be avoidable

1037
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,680
no matter how hard you try to break the

1038
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,440
speed of light you wouldn't be able to

1039
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,800
do it in principle okay so

1040
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,200
you cannot use internet without those

1041
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,119
fundamental protocols

1042
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,599
then how it was designed or you need to

1043
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,960
design another internet with different

1044
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,240
protocols

1045
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,640
you may call them different way

1046
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,520
but if we agree that dns is fundamental

1047
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,160
protocol this is where protective dns or

1048
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,160
dns firewall or rfpc which is engine or

1049
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,800
or heart of protective dns which we call

1050
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,920
that's as

1051
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,400
kudos to vixen

1052
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,280
my friend and my boss

1053
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,520
take down in the middle

1054
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,319
if you cannot avoid not going to dns

1055
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,960
then put a dns server there i have

1056
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,839
raspberry pi and i have 10 million rules

1057
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,440
and i argue strongly it is much more

1058
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,599
sufficient

1059
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,800
than any antivirus on my system

1060
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,200
and i will demonstrate you why

1061
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,000
so

1062
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,680
dns firewall

1063
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,200
is effective

1064
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,520
real time

1065
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,880
centralizing

1066
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,680
self-defense

1067
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,160
for your company

1068
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,560
and other cooperating parties at low

1069
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,680
cost

1070
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,760
you can dns you can have dns open source

1071
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,200
okay

1072
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,440
built in 15 minutes

1073
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,680
it would be your centralized choking

1074
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,839
point we believe that firewall is

1075
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,400
choking point

1076
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,280
firewall cannot perform as good as dns

1077
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,359
and dns also

1078
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,880
can operate with ips sir you actually

1079
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,280
have something fundamental

1080
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,960
under your control

1081
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,280
and you can see the logs if somebody

1082
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,920
hits the entry which you believe should

1083
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,920
not be touched

1084
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,000
it is hundred percent hit

1085
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,520
and you guys and girls actually

1086
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,359
uh are tired

1087
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,280
of the false positives

1088
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,960
here there's no false positives if

1089
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,240
somebody wants to go abc.xyz

1090
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,520
and you believe they shouldn't go there

1091
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,240
drop your coffee wake up and go and take

1092
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,359
a look

1093
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:14,000
this is 100 head there's no false

1094
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,640
positives why would somebody ask that

1095
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,200
question without reason how often you

1096
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,359
called your telephone provider asking

1097
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:25,520
for number of i don't know joe blow

1098
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,839
never

1099
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:32,480
okay uh let's continue protective dns

1100
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,200
number three

1101
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,680
yes we do have cloud dns providers

1102
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,680
and they offer some filtering

1103
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,800
i already mentioned that uk government

1104
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,680
and u.s government have a strong

1105
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,000
recommendation on protective dns

1106
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,839
and they recommended not only to the

1107
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,400
organizations but they recommended to a

1108
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,079
private sector to private citizens

1109
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,880
in uk though it is not available

1110
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,200
yes you can use one of the recommended

1111
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,040
cloud provider

1112
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,599
if you want to and of course not every

1113
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,000
household would be able to run their own

1114
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,200
uh

1115
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,640
dns

1116
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,079
right

1117
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,079
but

1118
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,040
you already have heard the reasoning

1119
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,599
why you potentially should consider that

1120
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,160
and especially if your large

1121
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,520
organization

1122
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,520
a cloud solution perhaps is not for you

1123
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,200
because based on your queries of your

1124
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,160
large user base

1125
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,920
someone would be able to imply or derive

1126
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,000
the activities of your organization for

1127
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,040
example what can come to my mind not

1128
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,280
just acquisitions for example

1129
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,920
divestments okay

1130
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,720
search for new ceo

1131
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,440
those things which can affect the market

1132
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,000
right and well-being of your company

1133
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,680
so why would you outsource this a strong

1134
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,839
information

1135
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:15,200
towards someone you may not necessarily

1136
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,440
have a contractual obligation or control

1137
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,960
over

1138
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,200
if you remember this uh

1139
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,839
cambridge analytica right they said that

1140
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:24,800
uh

1141
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,680
based on 10 likes or something they may

1142
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,720
know about you more than your family

1143
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,200
members

1144
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,880
if you're doing not just an acquisition

1145
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,599
you're doing your due diligence how many

1146
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,200
likes or dns queries you would have been

1147
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,240
doing

1148
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,480
during that period

1149
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,400
not only they would know about your

1150
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,559
company more than your family members

1151
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,240
but they would know about you more than

1152
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,440
your

1153
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,520
grave enemies

1154
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,880
and this is what the potential challenge

1155
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,720
here would be

1156
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,200
even if you use a doh

1157
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,720
yes

1158
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,040
site observer may not be able to see it

1159
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,960
you as incident responder wouldn't be

1160
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,359
able to do anything

1161
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:12,880
okay because it was designed to

1162
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,319
circumvent it

1163
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,960
but those who are on the receiving end

1164
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,960
would know about you everything

1165
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,440
this is a statement of fact

1166
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,240
okay

1167
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,800
we may argue how good or bad that is and

1168
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,200
whether it is acceptable for you

1169
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,559
but

1170
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,200
if it's not then the question would be

1171
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,720
what exactly you would be doing

1172
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,240
well if you are about from the crowd

1173
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,079
which are

1174
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,480
concerned which is concerned the crowd

1175
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,040
which is concerned about these topics

1176
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,280
this dns firewall right so let's talk a

1177
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,720
little bit about that

1178
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,480
when

1179
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,040
there were times when everyone run their

1180
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,200
own dns and

1181
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,319
many many years ago i did run my own for

1182
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:07,200
several companies and there was a domain

1183
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,319
and

1184
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:11,119
dns locks presented

1185
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,920
me with a wealth of information i was

1186
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,839
able to really

1187
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,319
kind of manage my environment

1188
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,880
you remember bluster you remember a

1189
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,200
slumber you remember all those things i

1190
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,000
do as well and if you don't well your

1191
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,040
google

1192
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,240
and dns was helping me and network

1193
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,960
monitoring okay so what's going on on my

1194
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,000
network okay who's talking to who

1195
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,920
uh i had two monitors

1196
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,839
dns logs

1197
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,680
and network

1198
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,200
communications

1199
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,760
and i would tell you uh

1200
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,079
on my watch

1201
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,400
we have never lost data

1202
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,880
in any company i served

1203
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,200
not because i'm so cool

1204
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,920
but because i use the right tools

1205
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,880
which i believed and still do

1206
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,119
are the most powerful

1207
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,680
because they use the fundamental

1208
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,559
protocols okay the fundamental things

1209
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,400
which fuel the internet

1210
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,160
so from the history

1211
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,040
okay

1212
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,839
the figuration and automation

1213
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:20,880
publish and subscribe model that

1214
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,200
what is in heart

1215
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,800
and the fundamental idea of the

1216
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,480
dns firewall or protective dns or rpg

1217
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,640
response policies on and that dns

1218
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,119
firewall protocols are dns tap and dns

1219
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,280
our pc so

1220
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,640
what are those things let's go

1221
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,960
here dns stop

1222
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,680
bring your

1223
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,440
queries and information about what's

1224
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,920
going on within the dns or your

1225
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,440
recursive dns

1226
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,599
then some analysis and then response

1227
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,400
policy brings it back

1228
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,680
okay

1229
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,839
and it is being done on publish

1230
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:03,599
subscribe so in real time

1231
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:08,000
in real time so what happening is that

1232
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
you can inform your dns server

1233
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,599
on fly

1234
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,319
tell me please how much time it would

1235
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:17,440
take

1236
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,319
to update a one rule on your corporate

1237
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:21,760
firewall

1238
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,760
if you have

1239
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,680
can your firewall has i don't know i

1240
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,280
have um

1241
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,280
i don't know 20 what 20 uh let's say

1242
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,960
5000 rules

1243
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,160
so can your firewall have uh

1244
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:36,960
uh

1245
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,720
20

1246
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,359
000 rules probably not but if you try to

1247
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:44,800
update it may take uh i don't know

1248
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,400
15 minutes longer i remember uh

1249
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,800
working with the firewall team for large

1250
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,559
uh telco

1251
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,040
uh they did

1252
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,000
updates of firewall rules ip firewall

1253
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,559
rules once a day unless it was

1254
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,800
absolutely necessary

1255
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,000
and it took them maybe 30 45 minutes to

1256
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
update it was 2010 2008

1257
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,119
so what i would like to say is that

1258
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,400
if you have dns and you have rpg it zone

1259
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,559
updates and you have this incremental

1260
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,559
thing and done

1261
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,800
in real time i will show you that as

1262
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,559
well

1263
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,040
okay uh let's talk a little bit about

1264
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,880
rpg rpc here

1265
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,000
there it was invented by us

1266
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,079
by dr paul dixie who couldn't attend

1267
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,920
today who is a co-author of this

1268
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,280
presentation

1269
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,640
and mr schreier back in 2010

1270
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,400
they were at ica

1271
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,400
isc at the time internet security

1272
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,920
consortium they prototype rpg and now it

1273
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,559
is in bind dns bind as open source rpg's

1274
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,319
free feature

1275
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,640
and it has been matured since then for

1276
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,279
10 years

1277
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,839
paul mccarthy's dr paul mccarthy is in

1278
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,760
our uh

1279
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,720
board for sideboard and he is inventor

1280
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,920
of dns so there is no one and paul vixie

1281
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,880
dr paul dixie was a maintainer of bind

1282
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,359
for many many years so there's no one on

1283
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:20,720
this planet knows about this more than

1284
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,200
we do

1285
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,119
that's why we can tell you with

1286
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,119
authority

1287
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,760
about what we are just talking to you

1288
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,160
today

1289
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,200
now

1290
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,400
the rpc is presented within unbound not

1291
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,400
power dns and of course buying the

1292
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,760
already mentioned

1293
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,640
okay

1294
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,799
subscribe

1295
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:45,280
and publish publish subscribe it could

1296
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,480
be done in real time

1297
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,440
even

1298
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,720
commercial

1299
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,280
appliances have now

1300
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,520
adopted rpc

1301
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,799
for example info belongs has had uh

1302
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:01,119
i think protective

1303
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,520
threat threats

1304
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,119
i don't remember all of them there are

1305
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,319
many there's a lot of vendors who now

1306
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,960
offer that and there are many different

1307
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,400
rpg

1308
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,440
feeds

1309
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,799
and methods

1310
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:18,240
against malware against uh advertisement

1311
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,040
if you don't like them well who does

1312
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,040
against botnets bogons covet

1313
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,119
newly appearing

1314
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,200
assets on the internet there are many of

1315
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,400
those

1316
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,760
it's not iatf effort but

1317
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,720
rfc uh has been drafted and periodically

1318
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,720
updated so this is quite mature

1319
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,319
technology

1320
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,720
quite mature solution and not only

1321
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,040
mature you can mature useless things

1322
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,520
right you can mature useless things over

1323
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,839
time and continue using it because

1324
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,079
nothing else you can do

1325
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,440
this one not only mature but it is

1326
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,440
useful

1327
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,760
it can protect you in real time or near

1328
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,400
real time in certain scenarios which i

1329
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,520
showed you

1330
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,400
okay

1331
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,640
it can be more powerful

1332
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,359
because of the design and distributed

1333
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,119
nature of it

1334
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:12,400
than

1335
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,200
many other solutions including ip

1336
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,839
firewall

1337
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,920
okay what are the implications of this

1338
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,920
the implications of this

1339
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,119
are that you would need to run your own

1340
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,440
dns or ask your dns uh

1341
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,720
operator

1342
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,720
to do it for you

1343
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,520
so now if you do have a a great

1344
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,440
relationship with your even cloud

1345
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,000
provider okay and cloud provider gives

1346
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,760
you very specific uh set of services and

1347
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,319
you can actually influence what is that

1348
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:51,280
you been offered and in return you

1349
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,680
receive dns logs

1350
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,240
right and that solution is tailored for

1351
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,160
you and you

1352
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,559
have contractual obligations

1353
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:03,200
go for it the only uh thing you now need

1354
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,400
to

1355
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,599
continue to consider is that centralized

1356
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:11,520
solution it was not how dns was designed

1357
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,400
okay

1358
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,720
and in case of failure it could be

1359
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,559
catastrophic

1360
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,359
you need to evaluate that risk okay so

1361
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:23,040
in a uk financial industry the cloud and

1362
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,200
computing

1363
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,480
has so-called concentration risk

1364
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,960
for absence of better terms consider

1365
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,839
concentration risk okay when solution

1366
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:38,559
designed to be distributed is being used

1367
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,400
centrally

1368
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,960
all right it is subscriptions and they

1369
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,599
are controlled by so-called tc it is

1370
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,480
transaction signature

1371
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,359
most of those are free

1372
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,880
you can find

1373
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,640
high quality

1374
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,160
anti-malware anti-fission etc etc etc

1375
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,040
feeds which will update

1376
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,359
your dns server or dns sorry will be

1377
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,760
updated automatically

1378
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,680
okay on subscription published attrition

1379
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,640
basis

1380
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,720
almost in real time

1381
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,319
some being updated once in 24 hours

1382
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:16,880
if let's say you want to use a feed from

1383
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,839
a far side

1384
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:22,319
the minute we see stuff we'll let you

1385
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:23,200
know

1386
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,119
and that would be called a newly

1387
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:26,960
observed domains and i will touch on

1388
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,680
that as well remember i mentioned before

1389
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,720
the assets which are new on the internet

1390
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,520
uh

1391
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,079
are not necessarily safe up to 70

1392
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,920
percent that's the figure you need to

1393
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,319
keep in mind so if you have a stream of

1394
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:42,079
new assets on the internet if you

1395
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:45,040
randomly pick up one up to 70 percent

1396
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,319
accuracy

1397
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:50,240
you would say it is bad

1398
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,559
or not safe i wouldn't say bad it's not

1399
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:54,000
safe for your business for your

1400
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,079
household to deal with

1401
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,839
let it mature let it sit on the side for

1402
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:02,160
a little bit until somebody would know

1403
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,960
uh how that asset would behave

1404
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,240
okay

1405
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,359
and

1406
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:09,200
a lot of threat researchers publish

1407
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,640
feeds

1408
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,720
some of those are on subscription

1409
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,160
commercial bases some are on uh on free

1410
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,280
basis and

1411
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,839
it's very powerful you you can use it

1412
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:23,440
you can use it

1413
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,160
out of the box in 10-15 minutes

1414
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,118
i'll show you that

1415
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,880
okay and if you enable that of course uh

1416
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,400
the market for it is

1417
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,440
is unconstrained remember in uk

1418
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,640
in the uk

1419
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,000
uk government since 2017 encourage

1420
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,799
businesses and public to use protective

1421
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:48,480
dns okay

1422
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,880
so businesses

1423
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,960
including small businesses

1424
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,359
and in the uk we have a top 10

1425
00:59:57,359 --> 00:59:59,599
security things which

1426
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,920
you would need to do to demonstrate that

1427
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,280
your security

1428
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,079
are unconscious to do that through 10

1429
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:08,160
things for small business could be

1430
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,920
unaffordable

1431
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,799
okay could be unaffordable so does it

1432
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:14,880
mean that you would be exposed if

1433
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,119
protective dns is not available for

1434
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:18,559
private sector

1435
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,480
well probably not

1436
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,440
dns fundamental protocol run your own

1437
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,760
things as a small business on raspberry

1438
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,480
pi and in 50 uh pounds uk pounds you

1439
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,480
would be able to run something that is

1440
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,000
far more powerful than corporate

1441
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,079
firewall

1442
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:39,599
and that is not exaggerated statement

1443
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:40,880
okay

1444
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,559
and you would be prior

1445
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:45,119
so now uh what is the market for this

1446
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:47,280
well market for this is very simple in

1447
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,359
uk we have over 5 million small

1448
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:52,559
businesses small business is defined as

1449
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,240
up to 50

1450
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,599
employees

1451
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:57,680
so of course if you have 50 employees

1452
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,400
you cannot afford cybersecurity program

1453
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,599
audit compliance it is very heavy for

1454
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:06,400
you what if you have i don't know a farm

1455
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,640
or a foundry uh

1456
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,799
it's not your core business right if you

1457
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,520
have a budget 5000 it could be

1458
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,480
three days of uh some consultant for you

1459
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,880
so how can you do that

1460
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,880
well there are solutions

1461
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,680
now

1462
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,000
among those five plus million small

1463
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,400
businesses in the uk

1464
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,599
they comprise

1465
01:01:28,599 --> 01:01:31,680
99.2 percent of all businesses in my

1466
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,160
country

1467
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:37,119
of course it's constant constrained size

1468
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:39,839
the opportunity for this powerful

1469
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:41,280
defense

1470
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,079
is out there

1471
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,040
if you are an entrepreneurial just keep

1472
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,920
it in mind okay

1473
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,920
you can share with your friends

1474
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,799
pre-built image for raspberry pi they

1475
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:57,440
stick it in

1476
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,400
and they go all you need to do is to

1477
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,240
help them configure their home router so

1478
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,880
the home router would talk not to their

1479
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,160
isp

1480
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,000
dns but

1481
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,039
to their own dns under the table or in

1482
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,960
the closet

1483
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,960
all right uh let's talk a little bit

1484
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,200
about dns rpg

1485
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,599
we have at far side

1486
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,200
at my day job

1487
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,359
several of those we call them newly

1488
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:26,799
observed

1489
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:29,440
newly observed domains

1490
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,319
and those uh feeds might be 10 30

1491
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:35,359
minutes 60 minutes a couple of hours 24

1492
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:37,280
hours and so on

1493
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,559
you remember

1494
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:41,280
if you take a newly observed assets on

1495
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,079
the internet randomly pay up to 70

1496
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,000
is not good

1497
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,520
not safe

1498
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,520
so what if we just

1499
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,720
deny access to this new asset let's say

1500
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,559
for 24 hours

1501
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:57,039
in 24 hours 80 percent of those will

1502
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,720
disappear

1503
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,440
so there are four

1504
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,000
if something new would hit you

1505
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,920
and you

1506
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:12,400
blindly denying access to it

1507
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,160
you would be safer

1508
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,480
and the only assumption you need to put

1509
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,480
in place is that there is no legitimate

1510
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,440
reason

1511
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,440
for anybody

1512
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,839
to go to new assets on the internet

1513
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:29,680
immediately

1514
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,240
there are some age cases

1515
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,400
but i am sure

1516
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,799
you would be able to understand what

1517
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,160
they are

1518
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,119
and if not 24 hours if 24 hours for your

1519
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:43,440
business is too much you can do it for

1520
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,799
30 minutes

1521
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:46,640
for example vixi

1522
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,520
runs rpg energy and you'll absorb

1523
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,880
domains uh in his environment for if i

1524
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,280
remember correctly like 10 minutes or

1525
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,039
three minutes and he believes that

1526
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:58,799
sufficiently enough

1527
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,200
i run for 24 hours

1528
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,960
and

1529
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:05,440
i feel absolutely

1530
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,200
good about it

1531
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,559
it has no

1532
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,480
a single

1533
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,799
click uh during my

1534
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,799
regular work where i clicked on

1535
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:17,440
something and i so desperately need it

1536
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,680
and i just shut down my dns

1537
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,400
it was one case though and i will tell

1538
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,839
you about this maybe right now

1539
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,599
this one

1540
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,200
i think it's quite appropriate to say

1541
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,319
about it my wife received an email from

1542
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:37,520
nhs national health services

1543
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:40,480
if you look at this email on the left

1544
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,960
it looks exactly as if i actually

1545
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,280
received it from the government

1546
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,160
the only difference is that it is not my

1547
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,000
name here

1548
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,640
usually they do and of course my wife

1549
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,960
didn't look at this but

1550
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,319
who does how often you do it

1551
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,079
well we are professionals and we don't

1552
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:02,079
do it what you can imagine from the

1553
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:03,920
regular republic

1554
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,400
of course you want to have a covet

1555
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,039
passport so she click on this link

1556
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,359
click on that button she did that

1557
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:13,680
and then she calls me hey boris internet

1558
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,440
is not working

1559
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,280
well it works for me right this is how

1560
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,920
we respond oh it works for me

1561
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,240
and then i ask exactly what is not

1562
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,559
working what i clicked on this button oh

1563
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:26,720
yes of course you clicked on this button

1564
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,160
what happened

1565
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,319
when i started through bill shirt

1566
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:32,799
i asked hey dns server

1567
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:34,400
can you tell me

1568
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,599
where this domain is sitting

1569
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,920
because that was behind this button

1570
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,400
right this domain and look at this

1571
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,920
nhs apps sort

1572
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,640
looks legit right

1573
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:52,079
application certification passport nhs

1574
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:55,440
look legit and i ask by default my home

1575
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,119
records of dns

1576
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,440
and my home records of dns says hey that

1577
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,359
domain doesn't exist

1578
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:02,960
and gives me nothing

1579
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,640
it shows me a finger

1580
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,720
and it was

1581
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,520
response policy zone 24 hours response

1582
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,599
policy zone

1583
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:12,799
what happened

1584
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:15,280
farsight security observed this to be a

1585
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,559
new domain

1586
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:19,599
and inform everyone across the world who

1587
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:22,640
subscribe for that feed for that rpg all

1588
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,520
their dns servers that this is new

1589
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,000
and depending on your policy you decide

1590
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,559
what to do with this i decided not to go

1591
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:31,359
there

1592
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:35,200
so my wife's web browser

1593
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,760
appeared as not working because internet

1594
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,760
is not working because before you go

1595
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,160
somewhere you need to go to dns and dns

1596
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,039
says no nx no domain next domain not

1597
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:46,960
existing domain

1598
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,480
but when i

1599
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:51,760
tried a very very popular

1600
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,240
open public dns server

1601
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,720
it gave me the ip

1602
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,920
i got ip from many or almost all not

1603
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:03,839
almost all it gave me ip from many but

1604
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:04,799
all

1605
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:08,000
public dns i tested including my

1606
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,599
provider

1607
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:13,680
what it means is if my wife used

1608
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:14,480
that

1609
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,680
specific

1610
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:19,039
default dns which is elsewhere

1611
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:21,920
she would be able to go to that website

1612
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,880
and perhaps submit whole her history

1613
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,799
first born

1614
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:29,200
credit cards everything whatever they

1615
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,880
asked right now look at the time it is 8

1616
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,000
25 and this is

1617
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
908

1618
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,400
i made the screenshot

1619
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,200
realizing that it would be good example

1620
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,359
but between she received this email

1621
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:47,119
clicked on the link

1622
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:48,880
and asking me

1623
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,440
it was maybe i don't know five seven

1624
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,200
minutes passed

1625
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,920
so now if you believe that your takedown

1626
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,280
service

1627
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,160
okay is effective uh measure

1628
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,680
think twice

1629
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,599
regular users would visit those

1630
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:05,920
malicious thing especially if they're

1631
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,720
well crafted

1632
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,880
very quickly

1633
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,119
you would not be able to go back a mall

1634
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:15,280
all across the internet all the web

1635
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,198
servers which you believe need to be

1636
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:19,759
taken down or domains need to be taken

1637
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:20,719
down

1638
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:22,719
but if you use this

1639
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:25,040
in this specific case

1640
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,679
internet will disappear from you

1641
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:30,080
what you can do here you can actually

1642
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,238
lend the user

1643
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:33,839
into the world garden

1644
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:35,279
saying look

1645
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,839
that most likely a malicious email if

1646
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:40,238
you believe otherwise please contact our

1647
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:43,040
incident response or security or sock

1648
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,920
whatever they and the the department in

1649
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,120
your environment is

1650
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,600
and if you don't do that but you watch

1651
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,839
for dns

1652
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:54,960
logs

1653
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,158
you would see haha boris's wife tried to

1654
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:02,719
access something that is not likely safe

1655
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:04,158
and they would be able to contact

1656
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:06,158
boris's wife and say hey what you trying

1657
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:09,198
to access that's probably not safe and

1658
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:11,279
so on whatever your incident response

1659
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,600
procedure is

1660
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,479
all right where we are we are here uh i

1661
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:19,279
just jumped forward and then i i'm going

1662
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:22,640
back this is how that could be done

1663
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,600
immediately and this is what uh far side

1664
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,000
security does there are many other dns

1665
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,600
providers

1666
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,279
and of course

1667
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:34,560
for you it is uh to choose from we have

1668
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,158
500 sensors all across the globe uh very

1669
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:40,560
rarely we don't see something that

1670
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,520
somebody else sees but even though you

1671
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,560
bring all the passive dns providers

1672
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,600
together

1673
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,759
there would be corners of the internet

1674
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:52,640
which no one of us would see

1675
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,158
uh there are advantages and

1676
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:57,520
disadvantages to uh to see uh

1677
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:00,480
to use different providers for example

1678
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,679
somebody could be very cheap but would

1679
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:06,159
give you a set of data which would

1680
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:08,400
require a lot of cleanup or you can have

1681
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,080
somebody who is more expensive for

1682
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,840
example a far side

1683
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,360
on that side

1684
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,159
but

1685
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:15,440
the data is

1686
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:16,719
crisp clean

1687
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:19,120
very very little glitches there

1688
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,840
so you you would decide if you cannot

1689
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,719
afford we have grant program so if

1690
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:26,159
you're a researcher

1691
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:29,360
we would give it for you for free okay

1692
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,760
and if you contribute into our database

1693
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,440
by having a sensor in your environment

1694
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,440
which is above recursive so we don't see

1695
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,800
your pii

1696
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,719
right so you share with us questions and

1697
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:43,679
answers we have very heavy discounts but

1698
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:46,000
again this is not a sales talk this is

1699
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,480
something for you to consider

1700
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,159
all right uh

1701
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:53,760
what are those uh kind of events in dns

1702
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,840
rpc

1703
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,600
right

1704
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,280
we will build with you today

1705
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:07,040
a dns firewall using ioc2rpz

1706
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,760
public project free

1707
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,199
one okay so you can use this

1708
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:16,560
uh we also were able to build pi hole

1709
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,239
and add guard

1710
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:19,280
okay

1711
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,600
on bind dns

1712
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,199
with rpg

1713
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:26,719
so we would have two

1714
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,920
you would have two

1715
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,480
systems if you use for example by ad

1716
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,199
guard you would use their

1717
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:36,400
feet

1718
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,520
plus

1719
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,560
rpg from far side okay this is how i

1720
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:41,840
built

1721
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,800
one of my recursive dns and another one

1722
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,080
is on

1723
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,080
ioc 2rpz

1724
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:51,120
i am happy to show you that right so

1725
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:54,719
this is my iec 2 or pc see no tracking

1726
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:56,960
block list et cetera et cetera and there

1727
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,320
is no

1728
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:01,520
these are the feeds and these are the

1729
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,840
hits here we will not go through this at

1730
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,880
the moment but what i would like to say

1731
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,000
this is one dns server running at mine

1732
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,840
one this is another dns server and

1733
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:18,719
both are running on uh on bind okay but

1734
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:22,239
i do prefer this one ad guard is cool

1735
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:23,040
but

1736
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,600
neither pie hole ad guard were designed

1737
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,560
for security rp's ioc to rpc was

1738
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,480
designed for security and a c2rpz gives

1739
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:35,440
you a ability to dig to the log so if

1740
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:38,000
you're a small business or you have a

1741
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,320
friend who would want to use it or maybe

1742
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,520
you at home

1743
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,520
uh among those i definitely would

1744
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,239
recommend that you see your pc very easy

1745
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:49,040
to set up one click 15 minutes you're

1746
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,520
done so threat stop this is the one

1747
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,560
which i

1748
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,120
forgot that stop has kind of a personal

1749
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,760
dns so you go there

1750
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:01,360
you download and your internal windows

1751
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:05,040
stack would not use any other dns server

1752
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:08,000
but would use thread stop

1753
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,800
with the kind of personal dns server you

1754
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,520
can run it on your uh android system as

1755
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,480
well so it is not a

1756
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,400
energy or

1757
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,400
resource uh hungry

1758
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,239
it can be done

1759
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:25,840
with no kind of a real hustle so that is

1760
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,920
the thing so we will definitely go

1761
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,400
through q a right after this session and

1762
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,800
then it would be a demo

1763
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,600
uh

1764
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,480
this is as i already mentioned as your

1765
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,040
rpg

1766
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,960
dns firewall on raspberry pi i showed

1767
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,120
you this interface and we will go

1768
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,920
through this one of those rpg feeds is

1769
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,120
uh

1770
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:54,960
is fsi energy farsight security inc fsi

1771
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:58,840
energy newly absorbed domain 24 hours

1772
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,960
rpg okay so i run all of them

1773
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,280
around all of them

1774
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:08,239
on my raspberry pi over 10 million uh

1775
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:11,199
rules i think if you try to have it in

1776
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:15,440
your corporate firewall uh just to uh

1777
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:17,280
to apply them

1778
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,360
may take maybe several weeks i think i

1779
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,040
don't know i didn't run firewall for a

1780
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,159
long long time but 5000 rules took like

1781
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:27,520
30 45 minutes so i would say maybe your

1782
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,560
firewall will die again don't quote me i

1783
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:33,280
don't know i'm guessing you try you try

1784
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,800
you try

1785
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:38,320
well no no don't try um

1786
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,560
don't try it at work okay because if it

1787
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,880
is broken you would blame me build it at

1788
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,920
home try it at home and then share

1789
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,360
somewhere

1790
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:51,440
on the media i have two q and a

1791
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,640
medium

1792
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:56,320
asking how do you compare bind rpg with

1793
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:01,040
pi hole dns is buying rpg more flexible

1794
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:04,400
all right so pi-hole

1795
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,040
uses its own dns

1796
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:11,040
and that dns doesn't have rpg so you can

1797
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,760
not rpz in anything

1798
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,159
through this so for that

1799
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:18,159
what you do

1800
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:22,320
what you do would be this one

1801
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:25,840
you go to

1802
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,120
labs

1803
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,840
forum labs fsi dot io

1804
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,679
you register there

1805
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:36,239
okay and you search for the blog post

1806
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,520
called industry great government

1807
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,719
recommended dns firewall on raspberry pi

1808
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,199
with pi-hole or ad guard

1809
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:48,800
for ad blocker so those two

1810
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,640
were designed to be ad blockers

1811
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:57,520
for them you build a first okay

1812
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,080
i'll show you okay very quickly

1813
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:03,040
so for that first you build your uh

1814
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,640
operating system for example uh ubuntu i

1815
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:10,159
use ubuntu okay on raspberry pi so once

1816
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:12,320
you build it you configure

1817
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:15,920
some stuff and once you did that

1818
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,960
you have now your ip stack and then now

1819
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:22,320
you have its own internal dns

1820
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,280
then you install bind

1821
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,719
to rpg okay to have rpg

1822
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:29,760
and

1823
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,320
you mount bind

1824
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,640
okay you want to bind

1825
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:38,239
on a different port and i will show you

1826
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:39,199
where

1827
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:40,080
that

1828
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,000
is

1829
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,840
i will show you where that is

1830
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,960
for bind

1831
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:52,080
you need to

1832
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,719
i will not waste your time so because

1833
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:57,600
internal dns is running on port 53 when

1834
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,199
you install it

1835
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:02,560
if you continue to run bind on port 53

1836
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,159
it would be broken

1837
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:06,080
and it would require special knowledge

1838
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,640
and skills to actually fix it

1839
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:09,600
so

1840
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,040
operating system updated put bind on it

1841
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,640
with some prerequisites you will go

1842
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,960
through the log and then you explain to

1843
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:20,960
bind to be run on a different port i use

1844
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,520
five three three five

1845
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,480
uh i will show you here

1846
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,480
settings maybe

1847
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,480
settings

1848
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:35,600
dns so i use bind on port five three

1849
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,679
three five okay so now you have a

1850
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:40,320
britain system you have internal dns you

1851
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,960
don't touch you have bind uh listening

1852
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,679
on five three three five okay and then

1853
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:46,800
you install

1854
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,120
piehole or ad guard

1855
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:52,480
and during the installation you say hey

1856
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:53,600
yo

1857
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,800
upstream dns server is not cloud9 code

1858
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,840
one or whatever but is this one your

1859
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,040
local one

1860
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:04,159
okay and then you're in business so what

1861
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,480
it means is your pi hole

1862
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:09,600
right would be using all the feeds it

1863
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,800
has

1864
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,199
right all the feeds that has

1865
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:15,600
from pi hole

1866
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,640
but our pc would be on dns

1867
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,120
and both would be working

1868
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:24,080
okay the same would be with ad guard and

1869
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:28,159
again ad guard would have a different

1870
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:30,719
view so this is your buy hole this is

1871
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:32,159
how to do it

1872
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,320
this is you know do it yourself

1873
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,560
instructions blog post right

1874
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:39,280
and this is how you would uh see it in

1875
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:42,239
ad guard as well okay that's your blog

1876
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:44,400
post but today

1877
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,360
we will be using not uh

1878
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,960
uh

1879
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,920
piehole or ad guard we'll be using

1880
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:53,520
ioc2rpz

1881
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,000
and again this is also blog post here

1882
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,760
and i will go through it

1883
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,280
so william

1884
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,920
uh i hope i answered your question a

1885
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,920
little bit longer but i think it is very

1886
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:06,640
good question okay so you need to make

1887
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,360
sure that first install bind

1888
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,080
reassign the port and then continue if

1889
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:16,000
you do want to use buy home

1890
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,920
miner asking in your experience how

1891
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,800
amount of systems resources cpu memory

1892
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,400
is required for

1893
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:27,600
500 peers in a corporate environment

1894
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,360
right okay

1895
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:32,320
this is very interesting

1896
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:36,800
i have my home router which is a quite

1897
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:41,520
powerful uh open vrt uh router okay uh

1898
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,040
last model

1899
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,120
last model

1900
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,400
let me see

1901
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,000
which one

1902
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:54,320
uh 192 168. uh sorry eight one

1903
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,320
sorry eight

1904
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,000
one

1905
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
gli

1906
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,880
okay

1907
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,000
this is my router very powerful uh

1908
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,280
little box

1909
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:09,360
and i tried so my dns uh is my my

1910
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,639
raspberry is

1911
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:13,199
connected directly to this dns

1912
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:14,960
and i started

1913
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:19,360
a stress test i think i was making like

1914
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,480
50 maybe 100 queries per second

1915
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,199
i would say if you have 500 peers in

1916
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:28,960
your corporate unlikely you would have a

1917
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,239
100 queries per second unlikely i think

1918
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:34,800
unlikely okay in the regular working

1919
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:35,920
hours

1920
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:38,000
so i did the stress test so what

1921
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,719
happened my router died

1922
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:45,040
okay so my router died before

1923
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,880
then my uh my pie hole

1924
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,280
okay or my dns you don't need to have

1925
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,360
buy hole right but if you do you would

1926
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:56,639
have it right so my dns server

1927
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:57,840
was

1928
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,800
healthy how do i know because i know the

1929
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,840
memory usage and i have so this has four

1930
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:08,000
gig of memory but my uh this one has a

1931
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
eight gig of memory so eight gig of

1932
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,040
memory right memory use is six percent

1933
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:16,320
this is my cpu load so when i started it

1934
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,159
well it went like

1935
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:22,080
20 maybe 30 percent but it was far away

1936
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,040
from from being dead or not responding

1937
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,920
my router died first to answer your

1938
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,400
question i don't know exactly how would

1939
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,320
500 peers in the corporate environment

1940
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,520
would behave

1941
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:36,639
but for 500 peers you unlikely would use

1942
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:39,040
a raspberry pi you both wouldn't let you

1943
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,440
do it right you probably would have some

1944
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,360
kind of a virtual machine with a little

1945
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:47,199
bit more uh memory and resources but

1946
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:51,840
dns servers are not demanding

1947
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,400
for resources as let's say firewall so

1948
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,960
you would need to have memory

1949
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,000
to keep all the things uh in memory for

1950
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,360
fast responses from cpu perspectives

1951
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:06,159
well it's not very uh

1952
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:08,639
very very demanding but when i did like

1953
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:11,920
up to 100 uh things it came to 20 30

1954
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,639
percent of cpu usage

1955
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:17,760
all right uh good questions i say answer

1956
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,920
live answer live

1957
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,679
and

1958
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:24,480
if you have uh more or i have not

1959
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,560
answered you believe just let me know

1960
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,360
and we will continue so it says still

1961
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:32,239
okay i say done i say done if you

1962
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:35,520
believe i didn't answer then you just

1963
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:36,639
let me know

1964
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:39,600
let me say here see here what's going

1965
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,199
oops

1966
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:43,520
please help me with the link so that i

1967
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,679
can follow through later

1968
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:48,239
which link

1969
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:50,639
all the links i will give you a

1970
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:52,639
screenshot and also it is in the

1971
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:54,480
presentation but if you tell me what

1972
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:57,520
exactly i'm happy happy uh to do that

1973
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:00,000
please help me with what oh yes i think

1974
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,760
i understand which link

1975
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,120
uh

1976
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:07,679
lamps dot f s i dot io

1977
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:09,600
this is our labs

1978
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,199
but forum

1979
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:14,080
is one of the icon when you register two

1980
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,840
labs but it would be

1981
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,639
forum dot fsi

1982
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:23,040
dot io i think that is uh correct let me

1983
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,199
see

1984
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,840
yes and

1985
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:31,120
i give you the link now you would have a

1986
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:33,199
a window which would

1987
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:36,320
invite you to register oh not this one

1988
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,360
sorry

1989
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:41,040
i need to do it for everyone

1990
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,320
okay

1991
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,600
right

1992
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,880
and

1993
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,360
sorry this one

1994
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,839
and

1995
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:54,880
and

1996
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,159
this one

1997
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:58,560
all right perfect so you would have a

1998
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:01,280
pop-up printer create your account

1999
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,760
if you try to have anonymous email i

2000
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,760
will block you because we would like to

2001
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:09,199
make sure that we can verify the users

2002
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:11,120
for obvious reasons right because there

2003
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,960
are some things on that

2004
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:16,080
forum which probably we wouldn't want to

2005
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:17,120
have

2006
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,960
publicly available for example some

2007
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:22,159
research on solarwind etc etc

2008
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:24,159
go go and check

2009
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,239
what we found in our database about

2010
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:28,880
solarwind i have not seen anywhere else

2011
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,440
so if you are into it you can you can

2012
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,520
you can get that

2013
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:37,040
okay so these are the uh email uh sorry

2014
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,920
uh web links um to resources which i

2015
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,679
mentioned if you want to learn more

2016
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:45,840
about dns rpg dns

2017
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:49,760
what can be more more uh

2018
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,880
obvious right dnstab info i told you

2019
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:55,520
about that labs fsi

2020
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,679
i already mentioned that for you

2021
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:02,159
and this is a youtube video when uh dr

2022
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:04,480
viksey was presenting i think it's

2023
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,320
thailand

2024
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,560
we wanted to make a demo very quickly

2025
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,719
and

2026
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:12,639
i just recorded what

2027
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:15,120
what are you you usually present

2028
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:18,000
and it is there it's a little bit rough

2029
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,880
maybe but it would give you idea i'll

2030
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:23,199
show you i have shown there kind of a

2031
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:25,520
real-life real-time

2032
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:29,360
things which are going on

2033
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,360
are there any other questions because we

2034
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:34,239
have another 14 minutes

2035
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:36,480
to to have a demo

2036
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:40,080
how to build this uh dns firewall so

2037
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,880
please let me know if you are

2038
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,280
curious about something else

2039
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:48,560
and i am happy to answer questions for

2040
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,560
you

2041
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,679
in the meantime i'll try my preparation

2042
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:55,440
here

2043
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,360
i believe that

2044
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,719
i believe

2045
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:01,040
that

2046
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,800
my presentation would be available so

2047
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,880
you would be able to see all those links

2048
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,280
if not make a screenshot

2049
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,360
and we can go

2050
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:14,880
so i give you a second to uh to take

2051
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:15,840
some

2052
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,360
breath

2053
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,199
and we

2054
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:21,679
will continue

2055
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:24,480
i will show you how you can do stuff

2056
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:27,440
which i described yourself because

2057
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:30,639
otherwise what would be the point right

2058
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:33,040
okay so

2059
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:35,600
i think i'm a little bit tired and i

2060
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,840
click too many buttons

2061
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:40,800
come on come on

2062
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:44,159
yes perfect

2063
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:47,040
we are not responding it's responding so

2064
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,360
instead of building on the um on

2065
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:53,520
raspberry pi from very beginning uh

2066
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:56,239
it is really absolutely uh the same and

2067
01:26:56,239 --> 01:26:58,159
it doesn't really matter whether you

2068
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:00,719
build it on raspberry pi or not

2069
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:03,280
by end of this process by end of this

2070
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:07,599
process you would have industry great

2071
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:09,600
this is not a speculation or

2072
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,320
exaggeration this is a fact

2073
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:15,360
government recommended it's a fact

2074
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:19,199
dns firewall it's a fact on raspberry pi

2075
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:22,239
yes if you follow this blog but i would

2076
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:24,960
be doing the same thing on on vm because

2077
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,480
it's just easy

2078
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:29,120
okay clone it etc it's just easy for the

2079
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:32,000
presentations and it's managed by ioc to

2080
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,159
rpg okay so you will go and read and

2081
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:38,639
it's very very very easy if you find

2082
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:40,960
some discrepancy leave it in a comment

2083
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,440
we'll improve it but this is what we

2084
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:46,400
will be doing okay so first first we

2085
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,960
need to build a

2086
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,360
a system of your choice my choice was

2087
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,639
ubuntu

2088
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:54,639
version 2004

2089
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:58,159
so i will start this running okay and at

2090
01:27:58,159 --> 01:28:00,000
this time

2091
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,639
by a time it would be booted

2092
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:05,199
it is us if we have

2093
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:07,920
this right so welcome to ubuntu

2094
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,880
this ubuntu is on raspberry pi

2095
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:14,000
but it doesn't need to be okay this is

2096
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,080
right after the boot i got this that's

2097
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,719
why it's 11

2098
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,239
memory usage and

2099
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:23,840
usage of the

2100
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:27,440
disk is 41 percent i use a 80 gig card

2101
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,280
because it's much easier because if you

2102
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:32,159
have a big card then when you when you

2103
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:36,080
clone it you have four gig of uh thing

2104
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:39,360
right and another like 128 of stuff

2105
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:41,040
which is empty

2106
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:44,159
i don't recommend that okay

2107
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:46,560
now this parameters right whilst it's

2108
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,760
booting so 41 percent and i specifically

2109
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,400
bought a kit from amazon okay everything

2110
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,360
is one so as if i have no clue what i'm

2111
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:58,800
doing and this is my first time right so

2112
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,760
it's just a standard plastic box without

2113
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,520
any heat sinks anything and temperature

2114
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,600
even in the summer time

2115
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,800
didn't go

2116
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:12,400
above i don't know 50 50 celsius degrees

2117
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:15,520
okay so now we have our uh

2118
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,400
our our

2119
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:19,360
system

2120
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,120
this is vanilla system

2121
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,639
okay with full updates on it so when you

2122
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:26,639
do it on on

2123
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:28,560
on the sorry

2124
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:32,800
when you do it on a raspberry pi

2125
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:33,920
watch

2126
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:36,960
first time you boot it it starts out to

2127
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,520
update which probably could be a little

2128
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:43,280
bit annoying but uh don't interrupt okay

2129
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,440
don't interrupt read the blog and

2130
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:48,000
everything you would have there is there

2131
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,600
now i did not assign any static ap

2132
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:55,199
anything this is on the dhcp on its own

2133
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:57,840
okay so let's see if i can

2134
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:00,560
come here

2135
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:08,320
i should be able to let's see

2136
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,639
i cloned it yesterday and maybe ip is

2137
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:15,600
different

2138
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:19,639
no ip is not different

2139
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,360
here we go

2140
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,159
okay perfect so

2141
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:30,800
what i have done

2142
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,199
right i logged in

2143
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:35,360
to this system

2144
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,239
why

2145
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:37,280
because

2146
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:41,679
you see 192 16214 128

2147
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:44,560
this is ip of my virtual machine right

2148
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:47,280
my vector machine okay i don't need it

2149
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,440
anymore

2150
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,840
i don't need it anymore i just minimize

2151
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:54,480
this and we will be using ssh because

2152
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,880
it's easy copy paste okay

2153
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:58,960
all right what next

2154
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:03,120
next we will be going

2155
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,480
and

2156
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:05,760
register

2157
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:09,760
on that's exciting stuff indeed on https

2158
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:12,960
ioc to our pc

2159
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,080
here we go

2160
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,159
so we go here

2161
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:17,920
we signed up

2162
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,760
but of course i wouldn't because i

2163
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:22,560
already have my uh

2164
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,199
my uh

2165
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:29,080
my account

2166
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:34,480
okay so these are some news etc etc

2167
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:38,080
this is uh things which i do

2168
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:41,920
because i already have uh rpg feeds from

2169
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,639
here so these are

2170
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:46,719
13 million

2171
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:48,080
rules

2172
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:50,320
okay

2173
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:53,199
so this is what i use

2174
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:54,159
right

2175
01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:58,000
so what i will be doing i will show you

2176
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,840
the rpg

2177
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,719
feeds so adult free

2178
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:05,760
before ai so once we announced at first

2179
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,840
sight that we would be using we would be

2180
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:10,000
giving the community free feed it's

2181
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,719
still not ready for some reasons because

2182
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:15,199
and we recently was acquired by domain

2183
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:18,719
tools exciting stuff but uh went to

2184
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:21,440
universes mergers right there's some

2185
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:24,239
things which uh still need to be solved

2186
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:27,600
right so they instead of two black holes

2187
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:30,320
one has to be formed it's forming and

2188
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:33,440
then gravitational waves so we are at

2189
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,280
the gravitational waves at the moment

2190
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:38,080
very exciting stuff and

2191
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:40,880
and community feed would be coming okay

2192
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,960
so sorry about that but it will become

2193
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,560
but once we announced that before i also

2194
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:49,840
created the rpg field

2195
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:53,679
all right so you have a community which

2196
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:55,360
will support you

2197
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:58,800
against malware malicious sites bagon

2198
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:02,000
ips dgas the domain generation

2199
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,440
algorithms

2200
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:04,960
how cool is that

2201
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,679
so if your environment among those 500

2202
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:09,360
things which you mentioned in your

2203
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:12,960
question would go some dga

2204
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,840
it is 100 percent

2205
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,480
a reason for your concern okay

2206
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:19,679
and

2207
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:23,080
many many others here why

2208
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:27,120
farsight is not here because farsight is

2209
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:28,639
a real time

2210
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:32,000
rpg feed using ixfr technology this is

2211
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,560
subscribe uh publish subscribe thing in

2212
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,960
real time okay

2213
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,280
that's why it is in custom

2214
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:40,480
feed

2215
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:43,120
so you go here and you say hey i would

2216
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:45,120
like to have far side

2217
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:48,000
we have either commercial

2218
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,560
right or community feed

2219
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,360
you would need to provide here

2220
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,360
all right uh

2221
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:57,040
a key name

2222
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,639
if you subscribe

2223
01:33:58,639 --> 01:33:59,520
right

2224
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:03,600
you pick up your hmac

2225
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,920
and this is your transaction signature

2226
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:07,600
key now

2227
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:08,960
some of you may say

2228
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:12,080
let me try you make a screenshot you try

2229
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,239
and it wouldn't work that is commercial

2230
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:18,560
fit and we not only have a transaction

2231
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,520
key but we also filter by ip so our

2232
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:25,199
commercial feed is filtered by ip so you

2233
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:28,800
need to be on my network okay to receive

2234
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,920
notification etc and this is our uh

2235
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:34,320
service so as you can see

2236
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:37,600
at the maintainer of ioc to rpg about

2237
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:38,800
impala

2238
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:39,600
he

2239
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:43,280
already created this the way that is

2240
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:46,320
seamless for you so you save it okay and

2241
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:49,280
you have this one right so you can

2242
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:52,560
verify what is that we have created yeah

2243
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:53,679
we done

2244
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:57,119
so what next next you go to the next

2245
01:34:57,119 --> 01:34:59,360
and you have this is my raspberry pi

2246
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:00,560
configuration

2247
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:01,360
okay

2248
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:04,080
with all those uh

2249
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:07,520
with all those things 13 million okay in

2250
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:10,000
this particular case 86 million so i

2251
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,199
probably skipped some so

2252
01:35:12,199 --> 01:35:15,679
8.6 million rules in my configuration

2253
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:16,719
okay

2254
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:20,480
and here is our demo

2255
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:23,920
in our demo i use on the first site rpg

2256
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:27,040
but you can use any other

2257
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:29,920
stuff if you want okay you can use all

2258
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:32,400
of them so this virtual machine which i

2259
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:35,440
shared with you would be capable to

2260
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,760
handle uh the

2261
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:41,199
load of all those uh 13 million 8

2262
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:44,239
million stuff but we are only interested

2263
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:47,199
in this so you save it

2264
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:48,880
what next

2265
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:52,239
oh well next you do this this is script

2266
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:54,400
url this is your

2267
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:58,639
url it uses curl you copy this

2268
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:01,440
and you go to your machine

2269
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,360
you say um

2270
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:04,400
mca

2271
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:07,360
there i am creating a

2272
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:08,840
directory for

2273
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:12,400
iuc 2 rpz

2274
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:15,679
all right and i go there

2275
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:17,679
and then i simply

2276
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:19,360
copy paste

2277
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:23,040
that script which is already there

2278
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,960
here we go

2279
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,280
all right what i need to do now i need

2280
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:29,679
to uh

2281
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:32,000
make sure i can execute it this is what

2282
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,280
i say hey

2283
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:36,719
change the mode for this

2284
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,400
done so

2285
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:42,080
we listed see it's yellow all good

2286
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:43,199
what now

2287
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:46,719
now now i need to execute it and i say

2288
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:49,760
sudo because that script requires that

2289
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,719
if i don't do sudo it would complain and

2290
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:56,239
wouldn't execute so sudo

2291
01:36:57,119 --> 01:37:00,159
ioc to our pc ba-bomb

2292
01:37:00,159 --> 01:37:02,719
password

2293
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:07,760
here we go

2294
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:09,040
it does

2295
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:11,360
stuff which is required

2296
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:12,960
if you are interested

2297
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,440
you just go and read and in fact i

2298
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:17,440
encourage you to actually go and inspect

2299
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,679
the script before running something from

2300
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:22,400
the internet but i know what it is so

2301
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:25,679
they i i run but for you please go and

2302
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:26,880
inspect

2303
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,000
because

2304
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
you know somebody can trick you to

2305
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,159
execute something that will you know

2306
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:34,400
flatten and break your environment

2307
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:37,920
you don't want to do that you only want

2308
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:41,119
to have something trusted okay

2309
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:43,679
okay so what next now we need to provide

2310
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:45,440
the secret

2311
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:48,239
i have secret on that screen and this is

2312
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:50,400
i provided the secret once again if you

2313
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:52,480
make a copy it will not work on your

2314
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:55,119
environment come back and we will figure

2315
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,840
it out what we can do for you all right

2316
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:00,480
is it correct yes

2317
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:01,360
now

2318
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,040
this will install

2319
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:05,520
lock to rom so if you have rom it's

2320
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,440
better to run that thing especially if

2321
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:10,000
you run it on sd cards

2322
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,880
okay because

2323
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:15,440
read write read write for sd card make

2324
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:17,600
it work and at some point it will be

2325
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:20,880
dead however i would say i run my pi uh

2326
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,880
for

2327
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:25,520
several years okay and i have not

2328
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:28,560
experienced any problems but but i do

2329
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,440
have lock to run okay all my logs all my

2330
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:34,560
rpg especially which are real time i in

2331
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:37,920
memory okay so i have enough ram and

2332
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,760
those directories are in memory so

2333
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:42,080
that's why i do recommend especially if

2334
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:42,800
on

2335
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,679
if you're running on a raspberry pi in

2336
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:48,400
here and if you run it on regular server

2337
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:49,679
give it a gig

2338
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:52,080
this is one gig if you want to run more

2339
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:54,560
than 10 million rules then

2340
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,560
you know give it two gig

2341
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:58,719
i don't think you will buy a server

2342
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:01,280
right now less than i don't know 16 or

2343
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:04,080
32 gig so be generous that's for your

2344
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,239
speed as well

2345
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:09,600
now i am just sitting and have a sip of

2346
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:13,199
my tea because i like t

2347
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:16,400
and it will do everything for you

2348
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:17,760
in the meantime

2349
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:20,000
i will show you

2350
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,800
what those uh

2351
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,800
dns

2352
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,800
nod

2353
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,880
rpg feed is

2354
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:33,440
edema

2355
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:40,239
so whilst on the right side on the left

2356
01:39:40,239 --> 01:39:42,880
side we do the installation of that

2357
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:45,760
stuff i'll show you what we see

2358
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:47,840
what you see here

2359
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,280
what you see here

2360
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:52,239
these are you can feel privileged really

2361
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:54,800
because what you see here what you see

2362
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:56,239
here

2363
01:39:56,239 --> 01:39:58,639
are domain

2364
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:02,639
which we have never seen before

2365
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:05,920
okay

2366
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:08,480
this is a domain these are the domains

2367
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:10,639
which we have never seen before what's

2368
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:12,159
going on here

2369
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:15,199
perhaps it was some updates which were

2370
01:40:15,199 --> 01:40:17,920
not uh

2371
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:21,600
here yesterday so boot image etc etc

2372
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,360
okay so let's wait for that we still

2373
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:24,560
have time

2374
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,480
so these are the domains which we have

2375
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,040
never seen before

2376
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:31,920
those domains statistically

2377
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,639
okay any of those

2378
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:37,199
any of these domains

2379
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:38,960
any of these domains

2380
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:41,040
randomly chosen

2381
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:44,320
most likely up to 70 percent or a bar

2382
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,480
would be not safe to deal with

2383
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:50,800
now because i am running my own dns

2384
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,760
right recursive dns with rpg

2385
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:56,719
i will show you

2386
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,960
how that works

2387
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,719
right so you see this on the screen

2388
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:07,040
and

2389
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,639
my dns already knows about it

2390
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:13,199
the difference between this and i

2391
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:17,119
started to query it okay with nx domain

2392
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:19,520
it was several seconds you say oh that's

2393
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,199
a tricks all right

2394
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:23,280
let one take some

2395
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:25,840
which is considered to be a very very

2396
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,199
good server

2397
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:29,920
and here's the iep so now with 70

2398
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:33,840
percent of certainty okay that ip

2399
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:36,159
could be malicious and besides look at

2400
01:41:36,159 --> 01:41:40,080
those look look at this

2401
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,159
they've been created in sequence i would

2402
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:47,199
suggest this is some kind of dga

2403
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:51,760
right so let's try again dig

2404
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:55,040
energy right next domain once again it

2405
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:57,199
could be a world garden it could be

2406
01:41:57,199 --> 01:41:58,159
whatever

2407
01:41:58,159 --> 01:41:59,040
but

2408
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:01,880
let's see if this is

2409
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:03,760
1.1.1.1 oh

2410
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:06,800
beautiful cloud flare behind which a lot

2411
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:09,600
of things are happening which a lot of

2412
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,679
security researchers and

2413
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:15,679
incident responders complain being doji

2414
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:18,719
here we go okay some code nine uh

2415
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:20,880
resolved it uh this is a lock what about

2416
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,960
google

2417
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:26,239
hey do they donate

2418
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:31,040
here we go what about uh quote four

2419
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:34,080
down

2420
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:41,799
what's going on

2421
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:52,159
are they dead

2422
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:56,560
i don't know what's going on okay well

2423
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,239
let's go back to nine nine nine nine

2424
01:42:58,239 --> 01:43:00,800
nine nine right

2425
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,040
so anyways that's what it is

2426
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:06,719
and by time of our experiments with my

2427
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:09,199
home i recursive dns hopefully i was

2428
01:43:09,199 --> 01:43:12,000
able to convince you if not let try once

2429
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,880
again so let's go here let's say dig hey

2430
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:19,600
give it to me

2431
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:23,119
all right so real time

2432
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:24,560
now

2433
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:27,760
our system here on the left side has

2434
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:29,280
been

2435
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:32,880
created and it says please reboot now

2436
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:34,800
you need to remember this because

2437
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,639
otherwise you would be able to get to

2438
01:43:36,639 --> 01:43:38,719
the web console

2439
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:40,800
now i don't want to remember this

2440
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:43,440
password what i would like actually to

2441
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:47,360
do is to uh change this password okay so

2442
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:50,960
you change it to whatever you like okay

2443
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:54,480
to whatever you like and i will

2444
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:56,080
change it to

2445
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:59,920
airplay admin so username are by admin

2446
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:02,639
and password airpod min

2447
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:03,760
not good

2448
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:07,360
but i don't just want to go and type it

2449
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:09,679
in i discourage you

2450
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:13,440
to use this kind of things especially in

2451
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:16,320
production environment and home as well

2452
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,840
because if let's say somebody

2453
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:21,440
compromises your system and goes to web

2454
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:24,239
interface and type ubuntu ubuntu by

2455
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:27,040
admin repair domain you would be doomed

2456
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:28,719
okay so be

2457
01:44:28,719 --> 01:44:31,119
really considered to operational

2458
01:44:31,119 --> 01:44:33,520
security i press enter

2459
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:37,360
ta-dang and i now say uh sudo

2460
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:39,440
reboot

2461
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:40,400
now

2462
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:43,679
all right so let's see if what i drew is

2463
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:45,760
actually

2464
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:48,560
is going on so here we go i am rebooting

2465
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:50,400
that system

2466
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:53,840
once it is rebooted

2467
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:54,719
we

2468
01:44:54,719 --> 01:44:59,199
may go and answer a couple of questions

2469
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:01,440
after the demo if you have time would

2470
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:04,320
you please share a big thought about uh

2471
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,880
the recommended implementation of

2472
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:10,159
protected gns in the network where is

2473
01:45:10,159 --> 01:45:13,600
having dns or https and gns secure

2474
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:16,400
indiana sex service running

2475
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:18,639
and do you think the protected dns

2476
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:21,280
concept will work a good synergy all

2477
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:23,040
right cool uh

2478
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,040
hendrick yes i'm happy to share and

2479
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:26,639
additionally you say

2480
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:28,560
the reason i was asking due to

2481
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:30,560
encryption of dns

2482
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:34,000
okay signatures to existing dns records

2483
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,320
right are considered as improvement to

2484
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:38,800
mitigate the nurse-related attack while

2485
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,840
the protected gns you explain

2486
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:45,320
right okay

2487
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:47,119
yes

2488
01:45:47,119 --> 01:45:48,719
we will touch on that i think these are

2489
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:51,760
very interesting questions right and i

2490
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:53,920
read them kind of for myself not for the

2491
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:57,040
audience they are here so the audience

2492
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:59,040
would be able to see them

2493
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,040
but uh let's go

2494
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:03,440
so we have this

2495
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:04,239
okay

2496
01:46:04,239 --> 01:46:07,280
it's done it's it's it's booted

2497
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:11,040
now we would go and see

2498
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:13,840
whether or not

2499
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,520
of course

2500
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:17,679
this is your environment you need to go

2501
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:20,960
here and you type our pi

2502
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:22,480
the mean

2503
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:24,080
uh our pi

2504
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:26,639
i mean

2505
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:33,840
so what do you have you have okay how

2506
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:36,800
can i move it i probably need to do this

2507
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,320
right

2508
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:41,119
we don't need this one so what do we

2509
01:46:41,119 --> 01:46:43,360
have we have

2510
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:46,159
industry grade

2511
01:46:46,159 --> 01:46:49,519
government recommended

2512
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:54,960
dns firewall

2513
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:56,880
which could be on raspberry pi in this

2514
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:00,320
case it's on on a virtual machine right

2515
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:02,320
we follow the instructions in in this

2516
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:06,080
blog and as you can see it took us less

2517
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:09,280
than 15 minutes to work so

2518
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:12,400
we started somewhere 30 something right

2519
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:14,800
we have a little bit more time

2520
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:15,520
and

2521
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:17,119
this is

2522
01:47:17,119 --> 01:47:21,199
where we are so this is our dns firewall

2523
01:47:21,199 --> 01:47:24,960
right 24 128 this is

2524
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:26,159
where we are

2525
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:28,960
all right so let's try

2526
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:30,400
this

2527
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:31,280
now

2528
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:33,280
because this is virtual machine

2529
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:34,960
and the network configuration is

2530
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:36,400
different right

2531
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:38,480
so i would definitely need to do

2532
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:40,800
something that i don't need to do for my

2533
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:44,320
firewall i need to update the rpc feed

2534
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:47,040
okay i need to update this rpc feed but

2535
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:49,520
in your environment you wouldn't you

2536
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:54,400
would not need to do so okay so let go

2537
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:55,280
and

2538
01:47:55,280 --> 01:48:00,080
let's say uh do some of this

2539
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:06,000
okay rpg and now we go 192 168. uh what

2540
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,719
was that two one four two one four one

2541
01:48:08,719 --> 01:48:09,840
twenty eight

2542
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:12,320
that um

2543
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,280
okay

2544
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:19,840
yes so we need to have this

2545
01:48:20,239 --> 01:48:23,520
rpg update feed

2546
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:25,199
okay

2547
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:26,000
and

2548
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,480
even though before that let's let's see

2549
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:31,199
if everything is working here and for

2550
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:33,679
that we would check whether or not we

2551
01:48:33,679 --> 01:48:35,119
have a

2552
01:48:35,119 --> 01:48:37,760
uh stuff actually uh

2553
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:39,760
loaded

2554
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,360
okay

2555
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:45,799
to make sure that things are working

2556
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:49,600
okay

2557
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:54,000
so let's say status first

2558
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:00,880
running very good

2559
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:03,360
and now i would like to check whether

2560
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:06,159
rpg feed came in here

2561
01:49:06,159 --> 01:49:10,280
so checking this

2562
01:49:12,290 --> 01:49:15,909
[Applause]

2563
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:24,119
okay

2564
01:49:24,119 --> 01:49:28,320
1453 1453 yes so we should be able to

2565
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:31,280
have at least at least some of those

2566
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:34,560
which we previously had so let

2567
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:35,920
let's do

2568
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:38,920
that

2569
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:44,718
okay

2570
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:49,679
here we go okay

2571
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:50,960
so

2572
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:54,080
i just queried something that i queried

2573
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:58,960
before okay presumably it was a dga and

2574
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:00,159
this is

2575
01:50:00,159 --> 01:50:04,000
no error but it doesn't give me anything

2576
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,119
and it is 24 hours

2577
01:50:07,119 --> 01:50:08,880
rpg

2578
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:11,679
okay so it works

2579
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:15,520
and the beauty of this is that you would

2580
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:19,040
be able to see it in your

2581
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:20,560
log

2582
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,639
it might or might not be yet updated

2583
01:50:22,639 --> 01:50:25,520
okay see i had two uh

2584
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:28,400
queries here

2585
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:30,800
okay i

2586
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:35,040
reboot to 10 to 10 block request

2587
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:39,080
yeah here we go

2588
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:40,880
okay

2589
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:43,760
so it was allowed because it was before

2590
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:44,719
the

2591
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:47,679
of the rpc if it was updated but because

2592
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:50,840
we had a bunch of queries for my home

2593
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:54,480
dns we should be able to see

2594
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:57,280
we should should be able to see 24 hours

2595
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:00,560
of pc see i

2596
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:03,760
got those things you name nx domain if

2597
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:06,480
your security uh

2598
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:08,400
analyst security

2599
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:11,520
responders incident responders your dns

2600
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:13,520
server would have similar locks you

2601
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:15,040
don't need to use

2602
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:19,040
ioc to your pc but for home for free

2603
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:21,599
please say thanks to

suggestions features requests and so on

2619
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:01,440
all right uh now i don't like this

2620
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:04,800
screens i don't need this screens let's

2621
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,480
answer the question

2622
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:08,560
okay the question was after the demo if

2623
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:10,480
you have time would you please share a

2624
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:12,239
big thoughts about the recommended

2625
01:52:12,239 --> 01:52:14,800
implementation of protected dns in a

2626
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:17,440
network where is having dns over hdb

2627
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:18,719
okay so

2628
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:20,719
let's say you have a network if i

2629
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:23,440
correctly understand that okay and you

2630
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:26,400
have all the systems talking to your

2631
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:30,239
recursive dns over https

2632
01:52:30,239 --> 01:52:32,239
if that is okay

2633
01:52:32,239 --> 01:52:33,119
then

2634
01:52:33,119 --> 01:52:36,400
that's fine because your recursive dns

2635
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:39,440
can receive encrypted uh queries

2636
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:41,599
and still use rpg

2637
01:52:41,599 --> 01:52:44,880
the one which i have shown you

2638
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:47,599
okay and you still because that dns is

2639
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:49,440
under your control

2640
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:52,000
so now if this dns is under your control

2641
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,800
uh i still not quite

2642
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:55,679
clear

2643
01:52:55,679 --> 01:52:57,840
to come up with the use case why would

2644
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:01,119
you need to you to use encrypted dns

2645
01:53:01,119 --> 01:53:03,599
inside your environment maybe it's your

2646
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:05,679
policy maybe

2647
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:07,199
whatever that would be if you like to

2648
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:10,320
run it please run it once again if it is

2649
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:13,119
your recursive dns you would be able to

2650
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:16,159
do the rpc on that dns if you have

2651
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:18,080
contracted party

2652
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:20,080
and you are doing this

2653
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:22,480
stuff to contracted party

2654
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:24,880
they would run our pc for you

2655
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:26,639
fine

2656
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:30,719
if you have access to their logs

2657
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:33,520
right it doesn't matter

2658
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:36,400
because you would see you would see that

2659
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:38,840
some stuff right

2660
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:40,880
was was

2661
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:44,880
queried over some policy

2662
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:46,719
and then you would be able to take some

2663
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:48,000
measures

2664
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,239
for or against those to enforce it okay

2665
01:53:52,239 --> 01:53:54,719
now when we talk about dns sec

2666
01:53:54,719 --> 01:53:58,000
i assume that the question was about you

2667
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,800
running dns sec well this is as

2668
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,960
authoritative right so then you would

2669
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:08,000
have uh uh so dns sec was predominantly

2670
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,880
designed against spoofing

2671
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:12,960
and

2672
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:13,920
and

2673
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:15,360
poisoning

2674
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:18,159
right because of the signature

2675
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:21,119
again in the scenario which i described

2676
01:54:21,119 --> 01:54:24,159
you should have no uh problems i'm just

2677
01:54:24,159 --> 01:54:26,480
not sure whether i answer your questions

2678
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:27,920
or not

2679
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:30,719
if yes tell me something if not you can

2680
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:32,960
take it offline what is the process

2681
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:34,080
running

2682
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:36,560
running showing domains in continue

2683
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:38,719
please is it our position what is the

2684
01:54:38,719 --> 01:54:40,880
process finding yes so

2685
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:42,800
what i showed you

2686
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:46,159
is a dns server operating system

2687
01:54:46,159 --> 01:54:49,040
dns server recursive dns server which

2688
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:51,679
has rpg feed

2689
01:54:51,679 --> 01:54:54,880
or many of those if you want from ioc to

2690
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:57,920
your pc or any other you can go and find

2691
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:59,840
those on the internet they're very high

2692
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:02,800
quality ones some real time some

2693
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:04,800
periodically updated far site is real

2694
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:07,760
time i showed you that okay

2695
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:11,520
and then on top of it uh this rpi this

2696
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:12,880
is uh

2697
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:15,760
uh i see your pc this is just a

2698
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:18,000
gui interface

2699
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
which helps you to run it without

2700
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,560
command line visualization statistics uh

2701
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:28,239
some logs you know etc etc so this is my

2702
01:55:28,239 --> 01:55:30,320
whole stuff this is what i can see

2703
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:32,719
what's going on right

2704
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:35,599
what queries were there some blockers

2705
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:36,800
see

2706
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:40,159
malwarebytes wanted to report uh to

2707
01:55:40,159 --> 01:55:42,320
malwarebytes what is that i'm doing why

2708
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:44,080
would i need to do it i just don't like

2709
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:47,360
it so it is in one of the rpc feed from

2710
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:50,000
ioc to rpg

2711
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,119
how is ic to be sustained how long has

2712
01:55:53,119 --> 01:55:55,599
it been running okay i see your pc

2713
01:55:55,599 --> 01:55:57,679
has several years

2714
01:55:57,679 --> 01:56:00,239
do i have it okay

2715
01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:02,560
rpg is it's

2716
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:06,159
okay i received your pc is several years

2717
01:56:06,159 --> 01:56:10,639
okay it is uh free to use it is based on

2718
01:56:10,639 --> 01:56:12,000
donations

2719
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,760
and

2720
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:14,639
we

2721
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:17,199
uh at far side really

2722
01:56:17,199 --> 01:56:19,840
would like to make it more sustainable

2723
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:22,719
and we consider how we can support ioc

2724
01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:24,320
to our pc

2725
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:25,520
uh

2726
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:27,360
to be more sustainable

2727
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:30,880
okay uh it would uh likely continue to

2728
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:34,000
be for free let's see 2020 and so on and

2729
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,119
so on you

2730
01:56:35,119 --> 01:56:37,920
yeah a couple of years so now i see your

2731
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:40,880
pc has i think maybe up to 100 customers

2732
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:44,639
maybe more right but once you once you

2733
01:56:44,639 --> 01:56:47,599
download and execute the script

2734
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:49,840
right

2735
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:53,199
these things definitely would be updated

2736
01:56:53,199 --> 01:56:55,760
through iec to rpg but when you learn

2737
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:57,679
how to run it you would be able to

2738
01:56:57,679 --> 01:57:00,480
consume different specifics from anybody

2739
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:01,360
else

2740
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:05,040
okay this is just a a cool thing to

2741
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:07,840
start right but if you have a commercial

2742
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:11,040
uh let's say uh ideas you can reach

2743
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:14,639
vadim and maybe have more than uh three

2744
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:17,280
different configurations right for for

2745
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:18,960
different environments

2746
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:21,599
i hope i hope i answered your questions

2747
01:57:21,599 --> 01:57:26,639
oh henry thank you uh great i also have

2748

anonymous how is uh sustained i think i

2765
01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:09,040
already answered that question

2766
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:12,560
answer done i personally donated to ioc

2767
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:14,880
to rpg when i discovered it and then i

2768
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:17,040
recommended it to uh

2769
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:21,040
for farsight to uh to kind of

2770
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:23,760
i wouldn't say uh kind of uh make a

2771
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:26,000
partnership but

2772
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,040
during the presentations to actually

2773
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:31,520
mention ioc to our pc and make a demo

2774
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:34,400
with it because among many others

2775
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:36,480
by hall at guard

2776
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:40,560
and uh ioc or pc ich rpc was the only

2777
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:42,800
one who responded to my query for

2778
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:45,840
collaboration okay so very for all kudos

2779
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:48,400
to ladies because he was great

2780
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:51,599
and he was able to really make

2781
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:53,280
this thing happen

2782
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:54,480
not for me

2783
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:57,040
not for far side for you

2784
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:59,840
right because you can now you can go

2785
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:02,400
here and in one click

2786
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:05,440
use something that was not possible to

2787
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:07,040
do before

2788
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:08,960
okay

2789
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:10,719
what is the process running showing

2790
01:59:10,719 --> 01:59:13,360
domains in

2791
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:15,599
what is the process running showing

2792
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:18,320
domains and oh i see

2793
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:22,639
uh right are you asking uh

2794
01:59:22,639 --> 01:59:24,719
okay so i think i understand what you're

2795
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:27,199
asking come on yes

2796
01:59:27,199 --> 01:59:31,199
so you were asking

2797
01:59:31,199 --> 01:59:34,080
you were asking

2798
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:42,480
about this

2799
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:44,880
so these are different uh feeds these

2800
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:46,639
are our observations from far side

2801
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:50,239
security this is so-called channel 212

2802
01:59:50,239 --> 01:59:53,199
which is newly observed domains so as i

2803
01:59:53,199 --> 01:59:55,760
mentioned these domains are those which

2804
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:59,040
no one ever saw before so if you ask

2805
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:02,320
anyone you're the first who see it

2806
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:04,080
okay this is

2807
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:06,320
above 99.9

2808
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:09,440
certainty what new means is that we saw

2809
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:12,719
it uh being asked somewhere not zone

2810
02:00:12,719 --> 02:00:16,000
files somebody actually asked to resolve

2811
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,599
this domain somewhere so it become live

2812
02:00:19,599 --> 02:00:22,880
okay and we now check

2813
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:25,920
10 years back to our dns db so-called

2814
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:28,880
nsdb passive dns database

2815
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:31,199
whether we saw it or not if we don't we

2816
02:00:31,199 --> 02:00:33,920
put it here we report it here so these

2817
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:36,800
are all new so this one

2818
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:39,199
vpn views

2819
02:00:39,199 --> 02:00:41,199
based on my experience it's most likely

2820
02:00:41,199 --> 02:00:44,320
some kind of fishing stuff okay so what

2821
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:46,080
else we have because this is not the

2822
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:48,480
only one okay we have newly observed

2823
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:50,880
hosts

2824
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:53,520
it's not domains these are hosts this

2825
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:55,599
one are hosts

2826
02:00:55,599 --> 02:00:58,880
and this is one in 100 so we observed

2827
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:03,040
100 but we report only one

2828
02:01:03,199 --> 02:01:05,280
right and this

2829
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,760
at the top

2830
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:11,040
it's a feed which goes directly

2831
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:12,639
into database

2832
02:01:12,639 --> 02:01:15,440
so in one second we observed

2833
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:16,960
approximately

2834
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:19,599
50 000

2835
02:01:19,599 --> 02:01:22,239
entities as you can see one in ten

2836
02:01:22,239 --> 02:01:24,880
thousand right so

2837
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:27,360
there's ten thousand past and we pick up

2838
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:29,599
one ten thousand we pick up one and we

2839
02:01:29,599 --> 02:01:32,320
put it on the screen this is a demo

2840
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:34,320
but you can subscribe to these feeds

2841
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:36,639
commercially if you like and you would

2842
02:01:36,639 --> 02:01:38,880
be able to feed them for example into

2843
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:41,679
your seam i don't know splunk

2844
02:01:41,679 --> 02:01:44,239
right especially especially if let's say

2845
02:01:44,239 --> 02:01:46,320
you talk about newly absorbed domains

2846
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:49,599
right so you can take this fit put it in

2847
02:01:49,599 --> 02:01:50,719
your

2848
02:01:50,719 --> 02:01:54,080
email server so don't talk to those mx

2849
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:55,920
records which are in that domain because

2850
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:58,719
they're new for a certain time okay so

2851
02:01:58,719 --> 02:02:01,599
you reduce spam significantly okay you

2852
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:05,440
tell your spanx to watch for that

2853
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:07,119
good so if something happened you have

2854
02:02:07,119 --> 02:02:10,159
an alert and of course you

2855
02:02:10,159 --> 02:02:12,800
consume this as an rpg feed into your

2856
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:15,599
dns server and therefore whoever goes

2857
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:16,560
there

2858
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:18,639
wouldn't be able to go i demonstrated

2859
02:02:18,639 --> 02:02:21,440
this right internet doesn't work but i

2860
