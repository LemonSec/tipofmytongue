00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,600
agree with

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,520
something chris just said

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,759
we are actually uh protecting our

48
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,399
communities not just simply protecting

49
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,920
uh computers

50
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,680
now um

51
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,920
early this year uh the kenyan uh c cert

52
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,680
coordination center

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,759
indicated that between july and

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,799
september 2020 it detected three point i

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,960
mean 35.2 million

56
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,960
uh cyber threat events

57
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,280
uh which was uh and that was just in the

58
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,720
quarter of uh july to september 2020

59
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,440
uh which was a

60
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,360
152.9 percent increase from the

61
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,400
previous uh quarter uh and and this was

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,640
accompanied by you know a commensurate

63
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,800
increase in malware and web application

64
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,760
attacks

65
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,200
they attributed this to the uptick of

66
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,560
e-commerce

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,200
and to the kovid pandemic

68
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,040
the attackers tended to

69
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,000
target

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,720
remote working systems and e-commerce

71
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,000
you know tools and sites

72
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,120
having said that clearly

73
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,879
other statistics have shown that south

74
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,920
africa kenya and nigeria tend to be have

75
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,080
been the most affected in terms of

76
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,120
quantum

77
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,200
uh across africa

78
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,840
indeed in nigeria the nigerian central

79
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,840
bank warned of a spike in phishing

80
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,879
attacks

81
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,840
uh malicious spam and ransomware uh you

82
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,120
know related attacks and these these

83
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,440
attacks tended to have

84
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,200
messages for example from health

85
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,760
organizations like the nigerian center

86
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,159
for disease control or even the world

87
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,720
health organization itself and so they

88
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,040
were using coronavirus as a bait to

89
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,640
impersonate brands

90
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,480
uh circulate unfortunately

91
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,280
disinformation uh thereby misleading

92
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,360
customers and employees

93
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,080
and so in some cases uh they were able

94
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,280
to spoof

95
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,840
the you know the registration process to

96
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,799
collect

97
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,840
government aid or even aid uh you know

98
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,640
from uh relief agencies uh packages from

99
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,319
relief agencies

100
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,239
and in other cases we've seen where

101
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,959
cyber criminals endeavor to collect

102
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,560
victims information

103
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,040
uh things like account details and the

104
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,040
like under the guise of a likely

105
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,480
transfer of

106
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,280
relief funds

107
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,760
on the 2nd of september 2020 the

108
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,920
nigerian economic and financial crimes

109
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,640
commission operatives arrested at least

110
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,360
13 suspects believed to be members of an

111
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,480
organized

112
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,439
criminal

113
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,120
syndicate who

114
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,760
specialized in defrauding victims you

115
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,639
know of a lot of money millions of naira

116
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,399
and though the workings of these groups

117
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,639
as networks or connected individuals are

118
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,639
not very clear

119
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,120
because it's still being proved by this

120
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,360
security operatives

121
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,560
that said

122
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,639
we've seen instances where criminals

123
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,360
impersonate bank staff and advise

124
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,840
victims to download mobile apps

125
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,880
ostensibly to ease their banking needs

126
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,199
including loans during this

127
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,120
trying uh period related to kobe

128
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,800
and the truth of the matter is i think

129
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,199
end users really need to be careful

130
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,040
check their emails even their phone

131
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,800
calls if they're claiming to be from

132
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,000
some of these

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
health organizations or government

134
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,400
agencies especially if the caller asks

135
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,160
for bank information or you know click

136
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,160
on any link or website

137
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,240
um you know also we know these basic

138
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,639
cyber hygiene rules of avoid clicking

139
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,120
attachments and emails you know that

140
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,759
especially if they they claim to have

141
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,759
some kind of kovit 19 pandemic

142
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,120
connotation

143
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,639
uh so we've seen

144
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,560
uh you know people downloading mobile

145
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,199
apps from sources they're not sure about

146
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,199
and those apps have tended in some

147
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,039
instances to contain

148
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,639
a ransomware

149
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,039
we also have another nigerian cybercrime

150
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,520
group called silvateria

151
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,360
that has specifically targeted

152
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,080
organizations and workers this time not

153
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,880
just

154
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,800
the organization but the workers

155
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,120
responding to kobet 19.

156
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,039
and i think one of the challenges

157
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,680
that i personally have observed and

158
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,280
maybe this is something other countries

159
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,759
can improve upon is that sometimes even

160
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,840
the names of these apps especially by

161
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,639
government organizations are not really

162
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,160
intuitive

163
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,919
for example the app relating to the

164
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,960
national identity management commission

165
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,880
which basically deals with you know the

166
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,479
national identity

167
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,360
is called mws i mean

168
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,720
what does f you know m as in martha w as

169
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,080
in water s

170
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,319
as in streets i mean what does that have

171
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,440
to do

172
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,440
with identity management

173
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
and so for example the railway

174
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,759
corporation in nigeria their app is

175
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,400
called secure fare but you see you

176
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,919
actually need

177
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,080
within the names of the apps preferably

178
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,360
at the beginning

179
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,840
something that directly relates that app

180
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,280
to

181
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,759
you know the end user organization or

182
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,759
agency

183
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,560
but

184
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,720
the cbn also says it's continuing to

185
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,759
monitor these criminal activities

186
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,280
and again

187
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,080
i think it's very important that

188
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,520
government agencies and private

189
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,360
corporate establishments

190
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,960
also monitor

191
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,720
however

192
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,120
while they are sending

193
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,759
awareness and advocacy messages by phone

194
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,479
and email to customers calling for

195
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,199
caution in all online transactions and

196
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,560
dealings

197
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,840
i think many of us especially in in in

198
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,440
public bureaucracy

199
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,280
don't appreciate that many of the

200
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,840
legitimate

201
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,479
recipients are functionally illiterate

202
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,720
and thus you know such messaging media

203
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,280
really needs to be uh fully considered

204
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,680
or in this case recon reconsidered

205
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,680
because there's no need sending a slew

206
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,560
of advocacy or positive messages

207
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,680
advising

208
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,319
people who inherently

209
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,479
it's not that they can't read at all but

210
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,039
they can't read very well especially

211
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,199
the lingua franca english

212
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,080
so

213
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,240
having said that we do need to

214
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,720
engender partnerships between government

215
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,240
and the private sector to address some

216
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,560
of these problems uh because one of the

217
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,800
challenges we have is that if response

218
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,160
mechanisms are

219
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,199
dominated by security agencies then of

220
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,520
course there are concerns that will be

221
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,080
raised about issues relating to

222
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,879
abuse accountability uh access to

223
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,639
information as well as

224
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,720
the obligations of even the commercial

225
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,199
sector players to report attacks if they

226
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,599
feel government is everything then they

227
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,599
may feel there's nothing that they need

228
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,160
to do and thereby quote unquote saves

229
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,400
you know their money

230
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,160
and so sometimes this may cause a

231
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,560
reluctance to report offenses

232
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,800
and the continuation of the perpetuation

233
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,520
of behavior that increases all of our

234
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,800
vulnerability

235
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,440
to cyber crime one of the ways forward i

236
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,039
think is also to

237
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,559
invest in joint

238
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,519
task forces to build confidence between

239
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,679
public and private sector and and i

240
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,640
think this is a a very uh

241
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,720
preferable option we should look at

242
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,880
because effective collaboration between

243
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,760
for example financial institution uh

244
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,080
corporates in nigeria we have the cyber

245
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,920
crime advisory council would be a

246
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,760
practical step because it builds the

247
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,320
multi-stakeholder

248
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,880
um ecosystem that you know i've heard

249
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,040
discussed by some of the previous

250
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,320
speakers in in other sessions the issue

251
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,640
though is that we do need to achieve a

252
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,760
positive balance between protection of

253
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,040
privacy

254
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,839
and then the need

255
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,600
enforcement

256
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,000
bottom line or rather really in

257
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,080
addressing the challenges

258
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,240
of

259
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,240
remote workforces during pandemic

260
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,880
anticipated the pandemic in the first

261
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,080
place no did any of us really uh uh

262
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,760
anticipate that we would live and

263
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,399
continue to live with the situation for

264
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,519
so long

265
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,880
um so

266
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,959
a hybrid approach i think would be very

267
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,640
useful to all of us

268
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,440
um we have the challenge of

269
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,360
managing

270
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,959
on-premise systems remotely

271
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,519
we do need to ensure that mobile device

272
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,040
management has

273
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,440
two-factor authentication you know to

274
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,040
access

275
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,640
as a default

276
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,200
we have to um you know deal with

277
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,680
distributed uh denial of services so

278
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,839
those solutions must be in place

279
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,519
uh we need to be able to leverage

280
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,160
managed service providers to increase

281
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,079
resource capabilities and incidence

282
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,959
response because again our communities

283
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,839
our uh our organizations do have

284
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,440
uh uh insufficiency or lack of uh you

285
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,760
know the right kind of resources uh we

286
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,640
also need to look at adapting or the

287
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,399
adoption of cloud-based options

288
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,120
requiring wholesale change uh such as uh

289
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,600
extended detection and response uh

290
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,760
because it becomes important that

291
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,839
becomes important as updates are pushed

292
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,040
in from the cloud

293
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,399
i've i've

294
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,079
learned from some of our uh african csos

295
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,800
is that um

296
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,360
for human error and foolishness

297
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,600
uh we must build capabilities with this

298
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,160
mindset whether the threat stems from

299
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,880
intentional accidental or part of a

300
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,040
larger conspiracy

301
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
cyber incident management demands

302
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,720
continuous improvements

303
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,800
based on monitoring the important what

304
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,200
we would call our crown jewels or the

305
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,640
important data

306
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,120
so we have to prioritize our data

307
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,000
remote worker systems are important and

308
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,880
does play a crucial role however

309
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,680
only it is only one component of a much

310
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,800
wider uh you know cyber security

311
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,519
uh ecosystem we must bear in mind that

312
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,839
cyber criminals look

313
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,480
and weigh the effort versus the game and

314
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,120
will always invariably take the cheaper

315
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,680
way to uh you know to carry out and

316
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,720
exploit

317
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,800
uh threat intelligence and collaboration

318
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,959
as many of uh the previous speakers have

319
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,240
said is key

320
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,560
we must continue to share

321
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,880
uh and increase the visibility of

322
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,320
develop and develop capabilities um our

323
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,639
remote worker environment will vary in

324
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,160
different locations

325
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,079
but we must understand that the remote

326
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,240
worker environment is a tug of war which

327
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,959
requires options to mitigate threats

328
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,839
without hampering underlying

329
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,000
productivity and in closing i would want

330
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,240
to say that institutions should continue

331
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,800
to raise awareness among their customers

332
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,360
on information security outside the

333
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,639
office space

334
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,240
they need to build institutional

335
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,800
capacity to deal with cyber crime and

336
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,160
keep abreast

337
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,320
with the innovations uh and the

338
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,160
technology in general

339
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,000
we must enhance existing

340
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
people

341
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,880
initiatives and last but not least we

342
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,920
must

343
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,680
always seek ways to protect the

344
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,760
endpoints which are our customers

345
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,160
regardless of their status or their

346
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,959
level of enlightenment or education

347
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,360

so

362
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,000

uh first of all let me thank you all for

366
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,920
participating to this uh session today

367
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,440
so let me introduce myself i am bernard

368
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,519
head of the watch alert and on the

369
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,760
division of things

370
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,240
subject of my presentation is about

371
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,440
observed malicious activity observed by

372
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,000
the insect during the covered 19

373
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,519
pandemic

374
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,800
so my talk is relevant to those

375
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,040
of us who are cyber security expert

376
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,720
computer emergency response team and

377
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,120
decision makers

378
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,440
so uh the content of mathematician i

379
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,360
will start in the introduction by

380
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,639
explaining the reasons of hacking then i

381
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,320
will talk about talk of several

382
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,639
malicious activities and i will finish

383
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,519
with

384
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,160
conclusion

385
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,000
so

386
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,760
we know all that the main goal of

387
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,480
hackers is to have an easy and fast way

388
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,560
to get money using their skills in

389
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,199
betraying information systems

390
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,680
so to reach this main goal they wait

391
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,880
passionately for the right opportunities

392
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,519
so uh the corona pandemic represented a

393
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,519
good opportunity for them and this

394
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,839
explaining the rise of malaysian cyber

395
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,920
activities in our currencies in the

396
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,199
world especially during the quarantine

397
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,320
period

398
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,360
they are similar in terms of types and

399
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,240
methods but the difference is only in

400
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,000
the number of occurrence from one

401
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,360
country

402
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,079
to another

403
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,959
so uh because of that government in most

404
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,199
countries in the world have resorted to

405
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,079
quarantined quarantine to limit the

406
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,800
spread of corona this quarantine imposed

407
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,240
on institution to adopt

408
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,959
remote work using vpn connection and

409
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,199
organize remote meetings

410
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,160
with the video conferencing solution so

411
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,639
working remotely using vpn imposed on

412
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,199
internet server providers an extra

413
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,240
effort

414
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,160
to provide secure

415
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,880
services and ensure its continuity for

416
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,880
customers

417
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,399
we also

418
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,120
find a phishing operation for some

419
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,120
employees who work in financial and

420
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,959
sensitive institution

421
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,120
in anticipating or visiting some safety

422
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,519
measures when working remotely or not

423
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,440
being well prepared to use vpn

424
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,160
connection or using a video conference

425
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,000
solution which has

426
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,639
which has zero day vulnerability or

427
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,639
weakness like the example of zom in

428
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,360
april 2020

429
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,240
so

430
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,079
in tunisia we found some malicious

431
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,079
activity related to this and some

432
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,880
markers it says activity

433
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,079
only an effect as

434
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,399
some hackers threatened the isp with

435
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,000
ddos attack

436
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,320
and demand the demanded ransom in

437
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,800
exchange for stopping this attack so

438
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,680
speak about ransom models as you can see

439
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,839
in this slide

440
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,359
so uh

441
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,039
as for the provision of earth and

442
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,199
financial aid which was carried out by

443
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,599
most of the government in the world

444
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,400
especially indonesia it was an important

445
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,559
uh driver of the

446
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,559
of the record by provoking the group

447
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,480
affected by corona and trying to steal

448
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,319
the reduction and personal data by

449
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,079
social engineering

450
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,440
fishing smashing attack fake news

451
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,919
fake facebook world fake website in

452
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,000
order to sit on them and to publish

453
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,440
their data

454
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,000
if they did not pay the required ransom

455
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,679
as soon as possible

456
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,240
so uh the tunisian government depended

457
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,080
on la

458
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,320
company with the financial operation of

459
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,919
those affected

460
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,799
by the corona virus it was constantly

461
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,000
targeted with its customer by hackers to

462
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,960
steal their credential so let's now look

463
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,880
at the next slide we'll show you what

464
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,679
has what has been passed

465
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,200
and sorted by date from slides 6 to 13

466
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,799
so as you can see this universe 9

467
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,960
prime 2020

468
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,039
another one

469
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,640
11 prime 2020

470
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,160
next one

471
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,120
7 may 2020

472
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,919
so i you can see on the slide that is

473
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:30,960
the

474
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,840
log file that contains the

475
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,320
victim identify

476
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,360
[Music]

477
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,199
nine november 2020

478
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,559
so already our investigation began that

479
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,440
uh

480
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,039
master cena not bad in the

481
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,679
involved in these attacks

482
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,559
another 1 30 in november 2020

483
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,880
the same method and thinking fishing is

484
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,200
missing

485
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,600
fake webpage fake

486
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,879
facebook message

487
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,559
okay

488
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,760
last one

489
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,559
so

490
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,559
we have 120 victim in less than

491
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,640
uh

492
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,679
24 hours

493
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,400
so uh also customer of measure telecom

494
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,799
operator indonesia have been targeted by

495
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,240
fake news

496
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,799
and vision attacks via facebook pages

497
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,840
controlled by hackers to entice them to

498
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,320
participate in falsified competition to

499
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
win a limited connection

500
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,360
this is an example

501
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,200
so

502
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,640
in addition we do not forget

503
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,960
vulnerabilities exploitation in the

504
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,440
information system of some sensitive

505
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,960
institution

506
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,360
and the installation of some malware

507
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,480
like ransomware web shell botnets and

508
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,120
advances persist persistent threats in

509
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,880
their private network

510
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,360
especially the expectation of the

511
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,960
vulnerability

512
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,919
of

513
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,080
microsoft

514
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,559
exchange

515
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,880
so uh to introduce the number of

516
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,760
affected microsoft ourselves uh service

517
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,919
uh transferred follow the process to

518
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,039
assist all the affected establishment so

519
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,480
banks government

520
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,080
presidency of the public private

521
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,159
companies hotels so um

522
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,720
multiple servers has been compromised

523
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,000
with the

524
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,480
worksheet

525
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,880
so

526
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,400
there is some malware installed after

527
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,720
the exploitation of

528
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,400
the vulnerability of microsoft exchange

529
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,039
i mean x

530
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,200
[Music]

531
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,960
fdh

532
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,200
so this is an sp webshell

533
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,679
okay

534
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,760
here are some marvel involved during the

535
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,679
investigation

536
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,720
so

537
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,000
there is a workshell detected by the

538
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,960
semantic and powder protection

539
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,840
in

540
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,200
victim

541
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,919
institution

542
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,280
so

543
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,080
as just to summarize the main point of

544
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,880
my talk the number of incidents handed

545
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,600
by twisted in

546
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,320
2020

547
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,120
was increased three times more than the

548
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,600
previous one due to malicious activities

549
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,159
during the covet 19 quarantine so all

550
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,960
groups like cyber security experts legal

551
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,240
experts government and social workers

552
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,360
must

553
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,880
work together in order to find the

554
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,760
appropriate solution to avoid or to

555
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,559
reduce hacking attempts during disaster

556
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,679
or during severe time

557
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,880
so uh

558
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,799

the kind introduction

592
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,039
and um actually been listening to you uh

593
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,120
most of the time and um

594
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,520
we are kind of in the same bin uh we've

595
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,720
been experiencing uh the same things um

596
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,720
technically with africa and with europe

597
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,880
and with americans as well uh the

598
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
pandemic actually did

599
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,600
uh

600
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,320
was an eye opener as well for most of us

601
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,480
and uh it's clearly have shown us a

602
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,760
message as well

603
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
um i wanna talk from perspective of

604
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,960
certs and what have certs uh felt during

605
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,279
the pandemic and what kind of detection

606
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,799
that we have seen from the malicious

607
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,880
activity uh whether it's around the

608
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,200
globe or here within the sultanate

609
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,559
cyberspace

610
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,679
um actually uh as dr hakeem

611
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,120
just mentioned earlier that as a society

612
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,320
um mostly has got affected by different

613
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,880
kind of categories so i'll talk about

614
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,120
generally what happened with the society

615
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,039
and then we'll go into

616
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,799
government or uh companies and

617
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,880
organization the society during the

618
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,679
pandemic was hit with very crafted uh

619
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,840
kind of social engineering identity

620
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,120
theft

621
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,559
a lot of the usual that has been

622
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,400
mentioned earlier

623
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,960
with emphasis on ransomware and

624
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,640
intelligence gathering so we have

625
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,279
noticed that a lot of impersonation uh

626
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,520
identity theft of uh world organization

627
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,840
health center or the cdc here in the

628
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,279
sultanate as well uh with different uh

629
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,120
versions of

630
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,240
an infectious map that has been uh

631
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,279
trying to uh be spreading around the

632
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,200
application especially mobile phones

633
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,880
where it tells you download this

634
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,279
infection map that will show you who's

635
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,039
getting infected around you and give you

636
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,360
alerts and also will give you indication

637
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,440
how many uh people are infected with the

638
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,039
corvette 19

639
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,600
during the pandemic from 2020 until

640
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,559
today

641
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,240
there are a couple of those applications

642
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,240
which are a malicious application that

643
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,320
again a root access to your device and

644
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,240
then they aim into financial

645
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,080
uh kind of credentials in the mobile

646
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,440
itself or in the uh systems uh general

647
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,840
uh the importance i want to emphasize

648
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,039
that

649
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,200
the specially corrupted malware and

650
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,720
malicious activity that has been

651
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,200
targeting the society as us members of

652
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,880
the society as well who works in

653
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,320
different kind of categories whether

654
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,000
it's in law enforcement or critical

655
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,159
infrastructure national infrastructure

656
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,039
or government agencies they can also get

657
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,880
hit either with that malicious

658
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,200
application or a family member who can

659
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,760
get uh who got that infectious

660
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,320
application for example a ransomware and

661
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,159
then spreads through the network now

662
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,039
unfortunately during the pandemic um

663
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,840
small to uh medium kind of

664
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,200
entrepreneurship programs or let's say

665
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,400
companies

666
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,520
have uh mostly suffered why because of

667
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,440
their weak infrastructure they were not

668
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,320
able or they were not ready for a sudden

669
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,480
transformation whether they are aiming

670
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,880
to provide their services online through

671
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,480
the

672
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,000
sales within the e-commerce system uh

673
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,039
let's say

674
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,200
transforming the business module or

675
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,840
actually accommodating a large number of

676
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,960
staff and employees working remotely now

677
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,279
the factor that assert we have noticed

678
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,279
that once we deployed a lot of remote

679
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,279
working remotely from home

680
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,039
they all start to get targeted in a

681
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,559
different way

682
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,679
perhaps when the infrastructure team or

683
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,120
let's say the support team within the

684
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,679
organization can better

685
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,000
save the employees from different kind

686
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,520
of attack because of the infrastructure

687
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,600
how it's set up the antivirus and so on

688
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,400
but once the employee has taken for

689
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,400
example his machine his laptop or his

690
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,640
desktop or anything working from home

691
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,039
then he's subject to a different kind of

692
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,120
atmosphere or infrastructure whether

693
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,200
he's using a free wi-fi maybe somebody

694
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,679
else is joining that wi-fi uh some

695
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,440
people are

696
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,360
family members who get their phones or

697
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,240
devices infected in the same network so

698
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,399
the network of the organization has been

699
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,880
compromised uh at home

700
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,720
and that's a different level so as a

701
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,960
search we start observing all kind of

702
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,320
malicious activity that are happening

703
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,559
either way home or or actually targeting

704
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,799
people at work at the infrastructure so

705
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,120
we are started initiating

706
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,039
kind of a guideline if you are working

707
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,640
at home you need to have a separate kind

708
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,240
of network if you are working at home

709
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,919
you need to ensure that you are

710
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,760
activating antivirus you are upgrading

711
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,320
yourself using a proxy uh you're making

712
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,520
sure that you are in a network alone uh

713
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,480
send a guideline how to operate during

714
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,799
the pandemic or working remotely

715
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:11,600
now

716
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,919
uh what kind of top malicious activities

717
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,000
that we have seen is social engineering

718
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,960
and also ransomware ransomware was

719
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,399
really huge

720
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,960
impact on a lot of organization

721
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,520
a lot of data has been lost

722
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,960
but again

723
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,000
we learning fast in a curve as well the

724
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,320
thing is that i want to mention uh as a

725
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,159
society as well that we're trying to

726
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,360
protect ourselves inside the society as

727
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,799
mentioned today earlier uh once we are

728
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,799
trying to achieve that level of security

729
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,799
or that level of awareness where people

730
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,399
are not supposed to click and malicious

731
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,200
link or they must identify that sharing

732
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,640
over sharing of information through

733
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,120
social media and getting the information

734
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,279
from the right places whether we can see

735
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,559
that a lot of

736
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,399
heat maps or infection maps that have

737
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,679
been spreading around they are

738
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,919
pretending to be an official one from

739
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,240
the world health organization or from

740
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,200
the cdc uh they start rolling out

741
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,360
vaccines and then again the shift

742
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,039
paradigm has shifted now they are

743
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,720
focusing on people saying hey get

744
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,039
registered in the vaccine or financial

745
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,039
aid during the pandemic a lot of people

746
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,039
have lost their work uh less of their

747
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,279
job so there was a different kind of

748
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,279
scheme that happened where people say

749
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,880
well the government is allocating this

750
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,600
much funds uh if you are interested or

751
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,200
you are affected please fill in this

752
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,279
information unfortunately people are

753
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,120
over sharing their information they

754
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,679
share their sensitive information some

755
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,600
people went to the extent that they are

756
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,720
sharing uh banking or financial

757
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,440
information along with otp for some

758
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,840
reason they believe that the otp will be

759
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,760
a type of verification where they can

760
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,679
verify they are receiving the money but

761
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,679
unfortunately they were scamming them in

762
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,480
there so essert or the national cert at

763
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,640
that level we have uh started giving a

764
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,720
lot of awareness uh we started spreading

765
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,720
the news we saw hitting in different

766
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,799
multiple uh attitudes we are being

767
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,240
active in social media we are being

768
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,159
active in the radio uh we are being

769
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,120
active even in tv uh directing people

770
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,960
that you should get the resources from

771
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,120
the right places you should get the

772
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,039
numbers and you should not over share

773
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,679
your information and especially sharing

774
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,919
the links from unknown sources claiming

775
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,640
to be a fund area or

776
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,799
trying or claiming to be an official

777
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,159
site that they are trying to get

778
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,799
financial aid and so on

779
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,880
so at that perspective and i know it's

780
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,840
been a long day and uh i just trying to

781
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,559
avoid a lot of the talks that has been

782
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,640
already been shared and overshared here

783
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,760
in the platform uh so yeah from that

784
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,440
perspective i would like to end my

785
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,760
short and brief

786
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,080
status on the infectious heart happening

787
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,159
during the covet 19 pandemic and the

788
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,679
malicious activity that happened

789
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,440
targeting society at first and then

790
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,039
targeting the critical infrastructure or

791
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,039
the dominant infrastructure at all back

792
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,600
at you alpha thank you hi dr thank you

793
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,159
very much yes you said an interesting

794
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,919
thing uh many many cyber security events

795
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,840
were because we had to switch online uh

796
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
on non-planned with an unplanned and

797
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,559
programmed processes so we had to face

798
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,399
many challenges thank you thank you

799
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,919
thanks again now i will go to

800
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,480
hear some features from a global global

801
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,720
organization from icon

802
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,519
with carlos alvarez carlos

803
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,519
leads icons and icons engagement with

804
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,320
the with the trust and public safety

805
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,480
communities i can in the internet

806
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,080
corporation for assigned names and

807
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,760
numbers and he will speak about dns trc

808
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,480
ticr project

809
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,600
dnst icr stands for domain name

810
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,000
security threat information collection

811
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,320
and reporting so it's over to you carlos

812
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,760

for staying with us even though we're

815
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,519
running a little late yes

816
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,559
um

817
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,960
so yeah like walter said i lead eiken's

818
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,440
engagement with them

819
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,840
in general law enforcement be criminal

820
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,600
or civil

821
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,600
as well as with all the different

822
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,440
flavors within the cyber security

823
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,600
industry that includes incident response

824
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,279
threat intelligence

825
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,880
operational security etc

826
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,039
the the topic that i want to speak with

827
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,760
all of you for a few minutes is

828
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,440
the project that we started at the

829
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,919
beginning of the pandemic

830
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,960
that we called dns sticker

831
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,200
that stands as welcome set

832
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
for domain name security threat

833
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,039
identification collection and reporting

834
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,760
in march of last year um

835
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,720
like many others we realized that we had

836
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,640
to do something

837
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,679
to

838
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,840
look into what the bad guys were

839
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,799
doing with

840
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,720
or in the domain name space

841
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,080
we were seeing

842
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,000
left and right all sorts of reports

843
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,200
some

844
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,000
claiming that um

845
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,240
that the world was falling apart because

846
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,360
the

847
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,600
malicious actors everywhere were

848
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,919
registering thousands and thousands of

849
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,080
domains

850
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,919
to conduct all sorts of different

851
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,799
malicious activity um

852
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,840
so we started our project

853
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,039
what it does

854
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,279
is that it pulls all the zone files for

855
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,000
all the generic top-level domains

856
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,840
that means all the

857
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,039
um the tlds that are not country codes

858
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,640
so remember that there are generic

859
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,399
top-level domains and there are country

860
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,480
code top level domains

861
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,760
the country codes have only two

862
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,240
characters at the right of the last dot

863
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,480
some examples are dot d e dot c dot r u

864
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,720
dot a t

865
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,679
anything that has three or more

866
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,159
characters is a generic top-level domain

867
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,840
so we

868
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,760
download um and analyze all those

869
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,560
corresponding to

870
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,000
tlbs with three or more characters

871
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,520
and we analyze them we look into all the

872
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,359
zone files

873
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:24,480
um

874
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,359
trying to find hits from a dictionary of

875
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,560
forts

876
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,760
that are related to the pandemic

877
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,960
that dictionary forms includes

878
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,079
tens

879
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,119
of words in different scripts not only

880
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,240
in latin script

881
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,000
[Music]

882
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,239
and we of course recently updated it to

883
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,520
include omnicron related omicron

884
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,399
not only but omicron

885
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,399
related um

886
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,760
terms

887
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,800
um

888
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
since the beginning and even though we

889
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,520
started in march

890
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,640
we did the analysis going back

891
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,119
to january of 2020.

892
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,240
um

893
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,720
just to see if anything had had happened

894
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,119
as the world was realizing that

895
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,520
that something was coming in january of

896
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,160
2020.

897
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,040
we identify the domains that have

898
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,359
anything to do with terms related to the

899
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,880
pandemic

900
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,440
and we verify them against

901
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,000
some mental sources that we think

902
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,280
are

903
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,359
probably the best for this purpose that

904
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,480
we could find virus total fish tank

905
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,440
alien vault otx and google safe browsing

906
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,240
the domains may or may not get hits

907
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,280
meaning

908
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,680
a domain that we see

909
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,880
as having any relation to a pandemic

910
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,040
term

911
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,960
may come back

912
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,359
with a report maybe

913
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,520
total says something about that domain

914
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,640
or maybe

915
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,400
google save browse and says something

916
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,280
about that domain

917
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,599
we then have a human

918
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,720
um

919
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,960
check the actual report that we get back

920
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,760
that

921
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,400
analyst

922
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,280
not only looks at that report but

923
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,119
carries on several other manual steps

924
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,440
and only if he has

925
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,480
100

926
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,800
certainty that the domain is not only

927
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,079
malicious but within icann scope

928
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,320
then that domain gets reported with

929
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,280
evidence to the registrar

930
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,359
with which the domain was created

931
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,480
for us as coordinators of the

932
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,760
technical functioning of the dns

933
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,560
we have the must that we have to avoid

934
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,040
false positives we can't allow ourselves

935
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,000
to report as malicious domains that are

936
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,680
not

937
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,000
and we have the obligation to increase

938
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,200
trust among registrars and registries

939
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,040
the registry is being the operators of

940
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,599
the top level domains and the registrars

941
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,480
in our world in the gtld space the

942
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,400
registrar's paying the companies that

943
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,640
sell the domains

944
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,240
to the public

945
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,119
after all this time

946
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,440
we have some numbers here and it's

947
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,280
interesting to see

948
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,920
remembering that i can't

949
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,720
remit is

950
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,200
is narrow

951
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,640
um

952
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,720
the project

953
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,280
was scoped specifically to address

954
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,599
phishing and malware domains

955
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,320
nothing else

956
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,560
we can't

957
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,839
look or act on domains used for fraud or

958
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,680
scams um

959
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,880
it's very specific because our scope

960
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,359
coming from our bylaws are to help

961
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,280
coordinate the technical functioning of

962
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,960
the domain name system globally

963
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,440
and we have to help ensure that it stays

964
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,960
secure and

965
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,640
resilient so this excludes content

966
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,839
um

967
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,160
and that leaves out many of the things

968
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,240
that that many others may have been

969
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,040
investigating

970
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,160
since january of 2020 to this month we

971
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,480
have identified

972
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,320
almost 360 000 pandemic related domains

973
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,320
that includes both legitimate and

974
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,960
malicious domains that's the total

975
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,920
universe of pandemic related domains

976
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,160
that according to our dictionary have

977
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,000
been created within

978
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,320
the entire detail the universe

979
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,440
now from may of 2020 to august of

980
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,000
this year

981
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,160
the number that we detected

982
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,800
was 200 almost 247 000 of

983
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,720
pandemic-related domains of which only

984
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,200
6.1 domains

985
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,640
came back with

986
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,680
a report from varus total or google safe

987
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,119
browse

988
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,400
or otx

989
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,520
so we have basically fifteen thousand

990
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,000
of the two hundred forty seven 000

991
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,680
pandemic related domains that we

992
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,200
identified as having at least one report

993
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,280
and not only that that had one report

994
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,680
but also that had name servers and were

995
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,680
resolving to an ap entrance meaning they

996
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,919
were operational

997
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,520
of this

998
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,680
our analyst

999
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,280
considered that

1000
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,000
only 4400

1001
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,240
had received high confidence reports the

1002
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,680
other

1003
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,400
10 000 and something

1004
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:58,720
um

1005
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,400
[Music]

1006
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,560
the reports received for those 10 000

1007
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,839
plus

1008
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,079
other domains were not of enough

1009
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,160
confidence for him to continue

1010
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,680
looking into

1011
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,760
remember that for example virus total is

1012
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,760
a collection of engines

1013
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,599
and some of the engines used in various

1014
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,760
total are

1015
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,240
worthy of

1016
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,599
but let's say

1017
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,079
in a very informal way are worthy of a

1018
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,599
whole lot of trust

1019
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,760
while some of those

1020
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,680
engines other

1021
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,480
among those engines

1022
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,480
you may not be able to trust their

1023
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,560
results as much

1024
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,400
i'm not gonna name names

1025
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,680
um that's not the purpose

1026
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,160
um

1027
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,079
[Music]

1028
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,079
and of those four thousand four hundred

1029
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,160
because of our scope

1030
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,079
um we could only flag as malicious and

1031
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,800
within our scope

1032
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,560
370 domains

1033
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,599
which is far different from what

1034
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,880
was reported or what has been reported

1035
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,520
in the median

1036
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,680
frequently that there were thousands and

1037
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,359
thousands and thousands of domains

1038
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,760
remember that caveat

1039
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,680
that we don't look at front we don't

1040
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,680
look at scams

1041
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,520
that's where the bulk of the domains

1042
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,119
related to the pandemic were being

1043
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,280
created

1044
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,800
and that that

1045
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
to me that that's what explains the

1046
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,319
difference in the numbers that were

1047
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,640
important

1048
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,040
um if you look at the reports that

1049
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,800
interpol has put out

1050
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,680
for

1051
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,280
palo alto

1052
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,200
now you will see that they have very

1053
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,880
specific information with tens of

1054
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,760
thousands of domains yeah

1055
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,599
they can include and they do include and

1056
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,119
they should include because it's within

1057
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,720
their scope

1058
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,040
domains that have been used to sell

1059
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,640
counterfeit masks

1060
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,640
to sell um

1061
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,640
miracle cures

1062
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,599
we can't look at that that's content

1063
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,680
that's outside our scope we would

1064
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,359
violate we would be in breach of our

1065
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,079
by-laws if we looked into that

1066
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,119
so staying within malware and fishing

1067
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,359
in the universe of pandemic related

1068
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:14,960
domains

1069
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,960
seventy months domains

1070
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,800
and we reported them to the registrars

1071
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,760
and they were acted on

1072
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,319
um

1073
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:28,480
unfortunately the project um

1074
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,040
is not focused on any particular region

1075
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,520
we don't look at this

1076
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,880
on a per region basis we we could we

1077
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,319
have not done it but we could probably

1078
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,240
um look for example at

1079
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,359
where the aess are located if if we see

1080
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,119
a malicious domain

1081
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,599
we could try to group them

1082
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:52,640
on a

1083
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,880
periodical basis

1084
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,680
and try to see what's there uh

1085
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,400
territorial connection where the as for

1086
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,319
each domain is located and then try to

1087
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,359
come up with

1088
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,240
match over time

1089
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,119
um we could also see where the registers

1090
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,560
are located

1091
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,599
um

1092
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,000
just to try to enrich the public

1093
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
reporting on the project but we are not

1094
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,720
doing so at the moment

1095
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,880
um for now the

1096
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,440
the priority for us is expanding the

1097
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,480
scope of the project um

1098
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,880
but this is a process everything within

1099
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,200
icann has to follow a process we are

1100
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,119
following that process

1101
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,079
um

1102
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,520
and um

1103
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,000
we are seeking input and we are in

1104
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,920
discussions with for example the

1105
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,720
governmental advisory committee

1106
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,599
um so that they can

1107
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,119
share with iken

1108
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,680
how the scope of this project should be

1109
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,839
expanded what other

1110
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,319
types of malicious activity or what what

1111
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,040
other kinds of events could be

1112
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,599
analyzed through this project through

1113
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,480
this tool the dns sticker

1114
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,319
we'll see where it goes

1115
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,560
but the tool is there it works it's

1116
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,760
effective

1117
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,760
and it's accurate

1118
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,720
so

1119
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,560
that's what i have for now

1120
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,240
thank you so much for your attention and

1121
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,560
waffle back to you thank you

1122
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,319
thank you carlos thank you for

1123
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:19,920
interesting presentation and the

1124
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,079
information that you have shared with us

1125
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,640
personally i know that within icann

1126
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,839
during

1127
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,680
this pandemic

1128
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,760
a lot and a lot of work has been done to

1129
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,800
protect the consumers from the malicious

1130
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,880
domain names

1131
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,760
so it was our last presentation in the

1132
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,880
panel

1133
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,119
is there any question from the

1134
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,560
attendance

1135
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,960
tent

1136
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,400
i can't see any question

1137
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,598
so everything was clear

1138
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,319
so i think i have to close this panel so

1139
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,640
i would like to thank you again uh thank

1140
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,280
all our nice language panel panelists

1141
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,000
for

1142
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,760
what you have shared and presented it

1143
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,480
was really very interesting

1144
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,960
and um
