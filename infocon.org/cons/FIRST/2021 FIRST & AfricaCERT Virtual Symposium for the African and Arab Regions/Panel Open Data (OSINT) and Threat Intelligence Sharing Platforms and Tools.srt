[Music]

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,160
thank you very much uh chris

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,000
so as you know

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,880
uh previous panel talked about search

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,720
service framework tools but also

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,000
outline the necessity to have data that

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,960
enable them to stay ahead of the game

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,160
and understanding the threat landscape

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,800
i have couple of speakers with

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,119
this session

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,960
and they will present on threat

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,320
intelligent sharing platform and tools

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,960
the desired outcome is to reflect on the

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,920
strategic role of search platform

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,399
and promoting collaboration amongst the

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,559
cert and supporting national and

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,559
regional exchange information model

18
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,879
our first speaker will be

19
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,480
andreas

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,239
eclody

21
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,800
andras works at the

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,520
luxembourgian computer security

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,760
assistant response team

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,320
serp as software developer

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,200
and he has been developing the missed

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,119
call since early 2030

27
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,400
andreas

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,439
over to you please

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,119
thanks a lot

30
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,159
and thanks for the introduction uh so

31
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,640
yeah indeed the plan is to talk a little

32
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,840
bit about

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,000
information sharing via mist

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,400
and also a little bit about what we as a

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,759
c cert

36
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,920
do with misspell so i hope that my

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,000
screen sharing is working now can you

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,640
see the slide

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,439
yes okay perfect perfect

40
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,280
uh so a little bit uh to start this

41
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,119
whole thing out what is misp in the

42
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,280
first place and what is the thing that

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,960
i'm going to be talking about

44
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,439
so misp is a threat information sharing

45
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,759
platform so it's free and open source

46
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,920
we've been developing it for a pretty

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,600
long time now so the whole thing started

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,759
in uh 2012 early 2012 late 2011 so quite

49
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,159
a long time ago and it's been improved

50
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,399
over and over by the community and by us

51
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,280
as well uh ever since

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,360
so it's basically the idea of a tool

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,040
like this uh threat intelligence

54
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,800
platform in general is that you're

55
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,959
taking in data from all sorts of sort uh

56
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,879
sources now misp is a little bit

57
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,319
different than some of the other threat

58
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,000
intel platforms is that it has a heavy

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,080
focus on sharing so that means that a

60
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,680
large part of the data that we're

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,840
dealing with uh with ms is basically

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,599
data that we are receiving from our

63
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,680
partners from our community

64
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,800
uh from other c certs and so on

65
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,599
as well as osm data obviously so we take

66
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,760
all of this data uh

67
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,519
that we produce ourselves that we

68
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,200
receive from oscent that we receive from

69
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,879
our partners we harmonize this

70
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,200
information we correlate it and we

71
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,080
enrich it uh by our internal tools via

72
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,840
the different tools

73
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,080
and subscriptions that we have

74
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,560
for services and then we can collaborate

75
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,159
on this information and feed our

76
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,239
automated protective tools with this

77
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,519
information

78
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,400
uh so that's one of the main outputs of

79
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
of such a tool so this is just a quick

80
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,239
idea of what mispis and what threat

81
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,680
intel sharing platforms in the first

82
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,879
place are

83
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,400
so who are we

84
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,239
we are basically an organization called

85
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,519
circle and we are the luxembourgish

86
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,959
national sea search for the private

87
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,400
sector so that means that we're funded

88
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,720
by the ministry of economy to build

89
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,480
security for the community at large now

90
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,159
luxembourg is one of these weird

91
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,680
countries that is very interconnected

92
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,879
due to the fact that a lot of

93
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,239
organizations are incorporated in

94
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,360
luxembourg so we we have a pretty wide

95
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,200
reach in terms of what we consider our

96
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,680
constituency and we and we want to

97
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,680
basically build these tools and data

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,040
that we're building

99
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,120
uh for the global community because of

100
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,000
that

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,239
uh we're also partially co-funded by

102
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,720
various eu projects to build a

103
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,720
build our tools including misp

104
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,280
uh so basically our our involvement with

105
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,640
misp is that we are leading the

106
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,640
development of the tool

107
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,120
as well as projects related to it as

108
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,799
well as managing a bunch of different

109
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,480
communities out there for the private

110
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,200
sector for cesar networks

111
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,360
for law enforcement military

112
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,799
and intelligence

113
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,840
communities financial sector and so on

114
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,519
and at the end of the day we're also

115
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,439
have users of the tools so we can give

116
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,600
you those a perspective of of uh what

117
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,918
sort of issues we're trying to tackle as

118
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,639
a c-sert basically uh using the tooling

119
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,800
uh itself

120
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,600
so

121
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,080
first of all before we get uh look into

122
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,520
the

123
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,960
the how and why

124
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
for using tools like this let's talk a

125
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,639
little bit about open source and this is

126
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,840
something that uh that has been a

127
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,320
recurring topic i think during the day

128
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,040
and the advantages and disadvantages of

129
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,199
open source uh i think that one of the

130
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,360
most overlooked and one of the most

131
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,520
important advantages of open source

132
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,800
tooling is

133
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,880
it's really that we're that most of us

134
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,120
uh that are in c-certs or

135
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,160
or socks or other security

136
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,720
teams we have a fixed budget that we're

137
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,120
kind of tiptoeing around every year and

138
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,880
there is no way around that we have to

139
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,479
fit everything that we have to do into

140
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,320
that budget now where we spend the

141
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,800
budget has a different impact on how we

142
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,280
as an organization can grow over time

143
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,680
so generally when we're in when we're

144
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,280
looking into different tools that we can

145
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,360
use we have the option of either buying

146
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,600
services so going to service provider

147
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,160
that will do all of these tasks for us

148
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,840
the downside of that is that we are at

149
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,600
the mercy of the service provider our

150
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,520
data is usually not kept within our own

151
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,560
premises

152
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,240
and depending on what happens with the

153
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,840
service provider might have an

154
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,320
operational impact on what we do

155
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,840
on the other hand we can also purchase

156
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,639
tools and basically run those those

157
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,960
proprietary tools ourselves uh in-house

158
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,039
now the downside of that is that we

159
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,800
besides that the

160
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,600
typical uh issues that come up like not

161
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,520
not being able to vet the source code

162
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,039
for example of the tool and know what

163
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,400
the tool actually does under the hood

164
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,479
is that most of our budget will be end

165
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,639
up spending on licensing and support

166
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,160
that means there's very little what we

167
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,919
can do ourselves to influence how the

168
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,440
tool works

169
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,280
and if issues pop up it's our support

170
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,759
contract set that we have to rely on

171
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,840
so it's not a bad option in terms of

172
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,000
keeping the data in our own network but

173
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,960
it's still

174
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,560
a black box that we're dealing with so

175
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,479
to say and we're still ending up

176
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,240
spending our budget on the licensing and

177
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,440
the support

178
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,960
now open source on the other hand allows

179
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,560
us to take our entire budget that we

180
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,720
have for the tooling and invest it in

181
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
personnel that will run the tool and

182
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,960
that will basically improve the tool

183
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,720
uh and the advantage of that that is

184
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,840
that training our own

185
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,400
colleagues

186
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,280
or hiring more

187
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,880
more team members

188
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,280
ends up uh growing the maturity of us as

189
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,280
an organization so these are reusable

190
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,759
skills uh and the personnel that we

191
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,440
basically end up hiring to manage these

192
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,680
tools can be used for other tasks at the

193
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,080
same time so it's enough to win for the

194
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,840
organization i think this is a really

195
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,919
overlooked fact so i highly encourage

196
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,440
everyone to also take this into a

197
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,039
consideration when you're making those

198
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,639
decisions between open source and

199
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,639
proprietary tools

200
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,720
that basically the entire budget would

201
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,199
in the end flow into uh enriching your

202
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,800
team

203
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,759
now

204
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,520
some of the let's look at some of the

205
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,639
cases

206
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,720
that we as a cser deal with with sharing

207
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,120
information in general and where a

208
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,960
platform like miss becomes interesting

209
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,560
for us

210
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,639
so we basically take the different tasks

211
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,160
that we do

212
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,120
at our certain in four main categories

213
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,599
um especially those that have a

214
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,080
at least some information sharing

215
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,160
connections we have our core services

216
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,759
such as incident response we have our

217
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,319
proactive services that mostly deal with

218
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,680
generating

219
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,599
security data like feeds or alerts or

220
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,560
notifications to our constituency

221
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,960
uh and also advanced services that

222
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,759
mostly deal with uh with collaborating

223
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,599
during incidents uh

224
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,840
with law enforcement with the judicial

225
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,800
arm or with the victims themselves

226
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,360
finally another main group is also

227
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,440
being an enabler for information sharing

228
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,919
but we'll talk about that in a moment

229
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:06,960
so

230
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,639
let's first look at the core services

231
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,000
part so i already mentioned that

232
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,800
incident response is a huge part of

233
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,680
this pillar basically for us as c-cert

234
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,440
one of the biggest tasks that we're

235
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,039
dealing with or one of the most volumous

236
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,000
tasks

237
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,160
is the instant response itself that

238
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,560
means whenever we are involved in in the

239
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,479
instant response that we get called in

240
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,479
by an organization

241
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,440
we basically have our process that we do

242
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,159
that we do starting from the uh

243
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,479
from the capturing of the data

244
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,640
investigation itself and then finally

245
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,399
the outcomes and dissemination of the

246
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,440
outcomes uh to the community so we

247
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,560
basically use uh miss partip as a

248
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,160
an internal storage for the ongoing uh

249
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,399
flow of the information that we derive

250
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,560
during the incident so that means that

251
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,080
if we're seeing

252
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,839
ransomware case we're extracting all the

253
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,760
technical information and we're storing

254
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,839
those in our tip

255
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,080
we basically derive indicators and

256
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,920
correlate this information

257
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,640
on the go in the system we enrich it

258
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,720
using internal lookup systems that we

259
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,240
host ourselves

260
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,920
such as passive ssl passive dns

261
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,240
systems and so on as well as all those

262
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,839
services that we subscribe for for

263
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,040
example virustotal domain tools passive

264
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,880
total whatever so a bunch of these

265
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,760
different services

266
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,760
so we basically immediately get more

267
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,000
information on the incident that we're

268
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,360
dealing with

269
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
by inputting it in our system and it's

270
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,120
automatically running these correlations

271
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,640
and lookups for us

272
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,320
so sometimes we

273
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,839
immediately see okay this is something

274
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,920
that the community already knows about

275
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,399
we don't really care about that much

276
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,680
about

277
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,519
deeply diving into it we see what we're

278
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,600
dealing with here so we save ourselves a

279
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,760
lot of time now this is where osm

280
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,360
information becomes interesting as well

281
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,120
because osint information allows us to

282
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,880
cross-correlate information and see

283
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,440
these are things that have been seen by

284
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,920
the community at large already so we

285
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,160
already get a pivot point that we can

286
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,120
use to investigate further whether it's

287
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,720
fully overlapping with what was shared

288
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,120
in the ocean community for example

289
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,800
we can also coordinate things like uh

290
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,200
like the actual instant response process

291
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,519
we can invite our partners to join our

292
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,399
uh

293
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,519
our mist

294
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,600
and to actually collaborate with them

295
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,760
and uh in the entire instant response

296
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
process and share what we are seeing as

297
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,480
we as the analysis goes along we also do

298
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,240
some additional tasks with missiles such

299
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,839
as takedown requests so what one of the

300
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,079
outcomes of an incident is often that we

301
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,079
end up with a set of infrastructure that

302
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,240
we're seeing is compromised and used by

303
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,480
the attackers that we should take down

304
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,959
requests to the

305
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,200
various service providers

306
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,320
so we have the tooling for that

307
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,839
available and let's do that directly

308
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,200
from there

309
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,120
and also we basically have another

310
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,720
system that we use to monitor

311
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,480
a bunch of different sources for

312
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,920
information leaks and we share the

313
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,760
information that we find there

314
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,040
uh through mispassword if you're

315
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,160
interested in the tool by the way the

316
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,600
link is there at the bottom it's called

317
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,519
air framework it's also open source so

318
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,040
just feel free to install it and get

319
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,640
started with it

320
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,320
now for the proactive services this is

321
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
uh where we produce data so that means

322
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,480
that uh that both as an outcome of our

323
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,040
internal analysis and research as well

324
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,680
as redistribution and enrichment of osnt

325
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,160
information goes uh goes into this

326
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,560
pipeline we basically take data from all

327
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,720
these different sources we put our own

328
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,040
analysis efforts on top of it and then

329
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,800
we share that information back to our

330
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,240
constituency

331
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,959
so we act as also an aggregator as well

332
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,279
as an enrichment

333
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,320
organization basically in this case

334
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,240
so i'm not going to go too deeply into

335
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,079
all the different options here it's a

336
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,560
pretty loaded slide so feel free to have

337
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,320
a look at that afterwards we have a lot

338
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,560
of options there of what you can do

339
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,079
now for the advanced services this is

340
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,519
something that uh

341
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,839
that obviously not every c cert

342
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,760
or cert will do in general but for

343
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
national c certs uh this is something

344
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,000
that is much more common to collaborate

345
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,480
for example or be called into uh

346
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,959
to to instant response cases where you

347
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:11,920
also

348
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,680
uh the uh

349
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,200
victim also wants to involve law

350
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,880
enforcement for example so this would be

351
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,160
something where we would collaborate

352
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,920
with them as well now one of the

353
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,519
interesting outcomes of a lot of these

354
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,600
cases is also the disclosure and the

355
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,600
sharing of vulnerability information so

356
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,160
we don't just share information about

357
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,320
the actual threats themselves but also

358
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,680
very often engage with vendors or with

359
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,720
with

360
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,120
close communities to share information

361
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,040
about the different vulnerabilities that

362
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,120
are found so even before it gets to a

363
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,680
point where a cve is being reported

364
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,279
there is already information sharing

365
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,200
going on before that

366
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,760
for the entire vulnerability disclosure

367
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,440
process

368
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,760
so you can coordinate the entire process

369
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,839
involve the vendor

370
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,399
work on a fix or wait for them to report

371
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,320
back uh that issues have been fixed and

372
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,240
then go through the open process of

373
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,639
reporting it

374
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,040
finally uh and this is something that uh

375
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,279
for most uh national entities will be

376
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,519
interesting uh uh one of the things that

377
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,040
we do is we also run a lot of

378
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,480
communities for

379
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,560
uh sectoral uh

380
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
groups as well so that means that if you

381
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,720
want to be an enabler for example for

382
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,959
the mandatory reporting duties of the

383
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,120
different communities

384
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,399
this is something that you can very

385
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,760
easily set up by running a miss

386
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,240
community for that specific sector the

387
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,000
specific group that needs to be involved

388
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
in that

389
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,959
also another interesting side effect is

390
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,639
that you can also use a community like

391
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,000
that uh

392
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,600
for the different members to be able to

393
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,639
seek

394
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,720
additional help for collaboration

395
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,639
so very often uh

396
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,040
when it comes to different levels of

397
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,839
maturity of the organizations this is

398
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,760
more and more required

399
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,199
so

400
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,720
besides these different sharing

401
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,240
activities one of the other goals that

402
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,920
we generally have and i highly encourage

403
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,000
everyone to think about stepping outside

404
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,360
of their sectors their national

405
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,680
boundaries and start to build larger

406
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,000
interconnected networks of sharing now

407
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,760
one of the interesting things is

408
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,839
obviously the most most important data

409
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,199
that you will be seeing is whatever

410
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,600
targets your organization your sector

411
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,920
your geographic location but there is so

412
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,680
much overlap going on between the

413
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,920
different attacker techniques that are

414
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,000
targeting the different uh

415
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,639
victims out there that sharing the

416
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,079
information about these different

417
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,320
attacks helps you basically see the

418
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
trends of what attackers are doing in

419
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,279
general

420
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,560
so uh one of our our our goals basically

421
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,959
uh sc cert is also to bring together

422
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,880
these different communities out there a

423
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,040
lot of the sharing in these uh these

424
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,279
silos of sharing that have been popping

425
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,360
up over the past decade such as

426
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,440
financial in sharing communities and so

427
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,639
on are already somewhat well organized

428
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,160
but the sharing between these different

429
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,720
communities still needs an extra push so

430
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,800
this is where where all the sisters can

431
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,079
play a huge role

432
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,839
so yeah this is basically what i just

433
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,800
went over so we can hop over that

434
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
now some something else is an outcome of

435
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,639
this entire process is that you're also

436
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,880
raising the maturity of your community

437
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,440
and you can really

438
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,279
take additional steps to make this go

439
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,480
faster than

440
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,920
than it would naturally in a sharing

441
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,839
community so one of the things that you

442
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,600
can do is when you're sharing

443
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,519
information and this is a large part of

444
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,199
information sharing nowadays it's not

445
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,279
just to share data and information used

446
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,480
to detect or block malicious uh

447
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,600
actions but also to share methodologies

448
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,440
so whenever you're sharing

449
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,279
what you uh the outcomes of the

450
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,959
investigation also share how you've

451
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,560
reached those conclusions

452
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,680
one of the things that has been

453
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,600
absolutely great to see in the community

454
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,360
is for example the sharing of detection

455
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,320
rules

456
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,600
of uh of scripts that the people used

457
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,199
during uh hunting

458
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,759
for for a given attack

459
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,519
these things being included together

460
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,920
with the actual threat reports become

461
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,680
super interesting when it comes to

462
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,920
giving ideas to other organizations in

463
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,399
your community on how they can

464
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,639
tackle similar threats in the future and

465
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,000
if you raise the maturity of your

466
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,480
community you will benefit from it uh

467
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,079
over over the

468
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,639
longer period of time anyway first of

469
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,000
all because you're interconnected in one

470
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,839
way or another with your sector or with

471
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,880
your

472
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,639
national community

473
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,560
or also simply because you will get

474
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,480
better information shared back to you

475
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,000
that you can use

476
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,800
uh but with all of this uh

477
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,880
anything that the that the tooling that

478
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,560
uh that we're talking about here will

479
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,320
solve for you nothing will actually

480
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
overcome the toughest challenge of all

481
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
of that and that is building trust

482
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,800
so having communities having community

483
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,720
gatherings is one of the most important

484
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,800
parts of the entire process

485
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,279
and also setting up play playing rules

486
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,720
that basically everyone can agree to

487
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,279
so to get started with misp you have

488
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,639
basically different ways if you if

489
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,079
you're interested in it first of all if

490
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,600
you're a first.org member you already

491
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,839
have access to ms benson so log into the

492
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,120
uh

493
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,279
miss vincent stuff first

494
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,959
you should automatically get access if

495
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,160
you're authenticating via the uh

496
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,000
iem solution of of first uh and finally

497
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,760
if you want to uh

498
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,400
join any national or sectorial missed in

499
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,559
your region reach out to them if they

500
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,599
have a miss

501
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,679
and if they have a community and if no

502
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,199
you can always set up your own it's an

503
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,640
open source tool all you need is a

504
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,880
server that you that that you can

505
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,880
maintain and install misspawn and then

506
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
you're good to go and then you can start

507
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,120
interconnecting with uh peers with other

508
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,880
communities out there and start

509
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,000
exchanging

510
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,919
information with them

511
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,960
so misp itself is one two out of uh many

512
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,799
that you that you should be looking at

513
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,679
uh

514
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,600
for open source tooling nowadays you can

515
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,840
pretty much build your entire tool chain

516
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,120
out of open source tools if you're a

517
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,160
c-cert

518
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,760
so we're living in pretty good times for

519
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,039
that

520
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,320
we have another tool that we're working

521
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,960
on currently called cerebrate that we

522
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,720
in particular want to build as a

523
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,480
community management tool

524
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,720
so this tool is being built as part of a

525
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,200
new funded project called millicertis2

526
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,280
the idea behind this tool is to first of

527
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,799
all do community management tool

528
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,400
interconnection orchestration as well as

529
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,039
fleet management for tools like misp

530
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,960
so to

531
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,559
summarize this whole thing because i

532
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,840
think i'm being a bit slow here

533
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
what you get out of all of this is you

534
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,200
end up with structured actionable

535
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,400
information that you can use for

536
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,640
detection blocking and so on based on

537
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,559
what your community produces what osm

538
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,400
data you get from uh

539
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,679
from out there

540
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,760
uh what data you get from vendors and so

541
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,080
on and you can collaborate on this

542
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,679
information uh

543
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,520
and also in your ongoing incidents using

544
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,960
this information

545
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,480
and build your

546
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,720
productive tools out of that pretty

547
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,679
easily

548
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,679
and also

549
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,600
last but not least again raising the

550
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,520
maturity of your community should be

551
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,640
always

552
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,240
one of the main goals of running a

553
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,679
community like that so if you're looking

554
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,600
into that direction this is one of the

555
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,760
biggest outcomes on there

556
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,600
there are some ways to connect to us and

557
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,280
some ways to get more information listed

558
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,120
there on the last slide so feel free to

559
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,640
reach out to us anytime if you have

560
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,120
questions if you get stuck

561
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,640
with it or if you just want to validate

562
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,440
your ideas on how to build a community

563
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,919
just let us know and we're here to help

564
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,559
so thank you

565
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,039
uh thank you thank you very much uh

566

andreas

567
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,720
for your presentation around community

568
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,160
building tool and these

569
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,000
something that comes

570
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,679
often

571
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,960
in

572
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,960
information sharing

573
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,520
is

574
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,480
the need for a vocabulary

575
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,600
of event recording and student sharing

576
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,880
and also

577
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,760
uh being able to like have a kind of

578
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,720
common languages for describing security

579
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,360
incident on this note i will i would

580
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,840
like to invite john greens

581
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,880

582
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,679
experience leading investigation of of

583
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,520
the elaborate and cyber security

584
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,799
incident

585
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,559
with the government and civilian

586
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:12,080
security sector uh over to you uh john

587
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,200
thank you very much are you able to see

588
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,880
my screen okay

589
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,159
yes

590
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,360
okay

591
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,720
excellent so

592
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,480
as i was introduced my name is john

593
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,840
grimm um i'm going to talk about the

594
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,440
varus framework the vocabulary event

595
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,679
recording in incident sharing it's a

596
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,320
framework that we use here at verizon

597
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,000
for building out our data breach

598
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,080
investigations report it's our annual

599
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,679
publication into the world of

600
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,120
cybersecurity incidents and data

601
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,159
breaches

602
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,840
we've been using varus for a number of

603
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,559
years the dbir is 14 years old and varus

604
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,640
almost goes back and far

605
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,600
in time in terms of that report itself

606
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,159
so i have a background in digital

607
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,200
forensics and cyber counterintelligence

608
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,640
uh from both the u.s army as well as my

609
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,799
years here with verizon in the uh the

610
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,000
corporate world

611
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,919
dealing with data breaches for our

612
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,960
customers so today i'm going to hone in

613
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,760
on the a4 threat model which is a core

614
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,400
component of the varus framework this is

615
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,720
something that organizations can use for

616
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,520
both

617
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,559
cyber threat hunting as well as

618
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,120
incidents as well as some other use

619
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,039
cases that i'll use toward the end of

620
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,880
today's session so

621
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,440
let me go ahead and get into defining

622
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,000
the varus a4 threat model so it consists

623
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,039
of four a's as you probably very much uh

624
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,039
can imagine with the the title of a4

625
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,360
threat model it's actors and actions

626
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,159
assets and attributes so actors are the

627
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,760
subject of the sentence if you're

628
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,400
looking at a typical english sentence

629
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,240
where these are the folks who are

630
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,559
conducting the actions which is the verb

631
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,559
of the sentence so actors and actions go

632
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,960
hand in hand they help us understand who

633
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,720
the threat actors are

634
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,640
the assets and the attributes are the

635
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,880
object of the sentence the assets are

636
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,679
what is being impacted in terms of the

637
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,200
threat actor activities and the

638
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,760
attributes are how we are showing the

639
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,240
impact to those assets and specifically

640
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
we're using the cia triad

641
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
confidentiality integrity and

642
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,400
availability so if you're interested in

643
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,320
learning more about varus the a4 threat

644
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,400
model and the vera schema in general

645
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,840
please visit the links that are on the

646
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,120
bottom left of the screen various

647
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,159
community.net as well as github.com i'll

648
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,520
provide these links at the end of the

649
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,360
session as well

650
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,400
so let's look

651
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,360
at the outputs from using the varus a4

652
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,280
threat model so this is just an example

653
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,000
of data data that i queried against our

654
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,440
data set from the dbir we have the dbr

655
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,440
data set which has 83 different

656
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,159
contributors worldwide in our data set

657
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,840
that's looking at breaches and cyber

658
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,760
security incidents so here i'm primarily

659
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,400
looking at breaches on the screen here

660
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,720
that i'm sharing and these are breaches

661
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,320
as defined by

662
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,159
cyber security instance was a where

663
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,320
there's confidentiality impact at 100

664
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,679
percent of the time what does that mean

665
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,080
that means we've confirmed that a data

666
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,159
breach occurred there's been a

667
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,159
an exfiltration of breach or a

668
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,240
compromise of data exploration of data i

669
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,480
should say or a compromise of that data

670
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,080
so on the very left hand side you can

671
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,840
see that data varieties and privacy

672
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,600
breaches this is how we show the

673
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,919
confidentiality attribute we're looking

674
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,559
at 2020 data

675
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:20,000
2271 different breaches and you can see

676
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,760
here percentage-wise the breakdown of

677
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,240
personal versus credentials medical bank

678
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,600
payment and internal this is very

679
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,760
informative this gives you an idea of

680
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,000
what's happening out there with breaches

681
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,480
involving privacy data when we look at

682
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
the actors which is the first a of the

683
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,200
a4 threat model highlighted here the top

684
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,480
three actors looking at 666 different

685
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,840
breaches involving privacy data

686
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,440
organized crime as you can see is number

687
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,279
one followed by an affiliated and system

688
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,360
administrator so the first two are

689
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,480
external actors the third one is system

690
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,240
administrator which is an internal actor

691
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,159
followed by developer and end user which

692
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,559
are also internal actors so this gives

693
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,240
us some granularity beyond where they're

694
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,240
coming from i'll talk a little bit more

695
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
about who these threat actors are or

696
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,760
more specifically the different

697
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,600
varieties of threat actors here shortly

698
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,039
but i just wanted to give you an example

699
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,120
here of what the information looks like

700
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,200
when we look at the verb for the subject

701
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,000
verb object of the air varus a4 threat

702
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,440
model you can see here looking at 1847

703
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,279
data breaches involving privacy we've

704
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,120
got use of stolen credentials which is a

705
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,520
hacking action a variety followed by

706
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,440
misconfiguration which is an interaction

707
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,840
variety and fishing which is a social

708
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,520
action variety so this kind of gives you

709
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,200
an idea from the standpoint of cyber

710
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,520
defenses as well as intelligence where

711
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,840
to focus your defenses on in terms of

712
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,240
privacy breaches and how the threat

713
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,679
actors are

714
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,000
actioning against those assets that

715
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,360
they're targeting so speaking of the

716
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,880
assets which is the third day of the

717
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,720
fourth rap model

718
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,159
these are the asset varieties and

719
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,559
privacy breaches looking at the 2020

720
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,679
time frame web application server at 55

721
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,480
and mail servers at 45 44

722
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,039
followed by database servers at 17 and

723
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,440
then documents which is a form of media

724
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,640
at 10

725
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,480
and then finally the fourth a here is

726
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,080
attributes and we're only looking at the

727
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,559
integrity attributes the confidentiality

728
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,559
attribute is in the data varieties on

729
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,559
the far left of the screen and the

730
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,559
availability just not showing that as an

731
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,000
example but i will talk about that

732
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,080
shortly so you can see the top three

733
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,000
integrity varieties and privacy breaches

734
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,640
or software insulation at 56 percent

735
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,520
altered behavior at 41 and modified data

736
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,279
at 22

737
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,760
so this is an example of how you can use

738
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,400
the data in terms of various and more

739
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,320
specifically the a4 threat model to

740
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,799
convey what's happening in terms of

741
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,880
specifically here privacy data breaches

742
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,360
so let's let's take a step back here and

743
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,360
look at the action so

744
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,200
i did skip over the actors there are

745
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,760
three actor categories the external

746
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,559
internal partner external actors

747
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,279
do not have any legitimate access to the

748
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,799
data the assets the environment they're

749
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,039
outside the building logically or

750
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,880
physically they're halfway around the

751
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,880
world logically they just do not have

752
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,559
access and they're actually attacking or

753
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,559
hacking into the environment

754
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,640
the internal actors have some level of

755
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,400
trust and privilege to the data the

756
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,559
assets in the environment these folks

757
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,200
are nefarious as well as folks that are

758
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,559
committing errors so they're not

759
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,360
necessarily nefarious so internal actors

760
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,440
for varus are those folks who have some

761
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,279
level of trust and privilege they could

762
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,120
be an end user they could be assisted

763
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,799
administrator they could be a manager

764
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,640
they could be a finance person

765
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,039
the actions are what the acts are actors

766
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,799
take and there's seven action categories

767
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,640
you can see here starting from right to

768
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,880
left or environmental and physical those

769
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,880
are two actions that we see sometimes in

770
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,039
our case load as well as in the overall

771
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,440
dbi or data set not so much though

772
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,039
compared to the other actions a good

773
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,400
example the physical would be your

774
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,640
payment card skimmers for example

775
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,000
when we look at error which is the

776
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,840
bottom left there these are actions

777
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,080
committed by the internal actors or the

778
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,080
partners the partners or actors who have

779
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,000
some level trust and privilege to the

780
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,760
data the assets in the environment

781
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,000
errors do not typically have a motive

782
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,200
but again

783
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,960
they are mistakes and they are committed

784
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,880
by partners or internal

785
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,919
actors misuse is another action category

786
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,240
that could be committed by an internal

787
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,960
actor or a partner actor this is exactly

788
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,880
how it sounds it's misusing or abusing

789
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,399
something such as credentials or

790
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,320
hardware data and it leads to a data

791
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,240
breach social malware and hacking are

792
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,159
the top three actions we typically see

793
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,320
across the board social is the very

794
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,399
front end typically of a path-based

795
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,399
attack where it's a threat actor

796
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,919
externality organization that's

797
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,480
leveraging the human element sending out

798
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
featuring emails for example or

799
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,760
pretexting

800
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,720
the the targeted entity and gaining

801
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,559
access into the environment or gaining

802
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,799
access to the data hacking or the

803
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,039
actions taken by the attacker and

804
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,720
malware are the actions taken by the

805
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,320
malicious software so these are the

806
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,039
seven action categories they're good to

807
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:53,919
know

808
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,840
but what's even more informative is

809
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,919
knowing the varieties underneath each

810
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,159
one of the actions and this is just an

811
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,159
example here of hacking actions and

812
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,279
breaches if you're interested in

813
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,080
learning more about the data that's been

814
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,679
put together by our data scientists you

815
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,840
can simply go to the interactive website

816
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,279
the link is on the bottom this is just

817
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,159
screenshots from that website this shows

818
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,159
actions from the standpoint of motives

819
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,279
espionage motive in yellow at the top

820
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,279
financial motive in orange at the bottom

821
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,640
so we've got two motives that we

822
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,520
primarily see within the dbir data set

823
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,000
number one motive is financial by far

824
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
number two is espionage and then after

825
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,679
that there are some minor motives like

826
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,080
such as fear ideology grudge and fun

827
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,760
which i'm not showing here on the screen

828
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,200
so the varieties are the more

829
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,279
detailed uh

830
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,279
information that falls under each of

831
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,200
those seven action categories here we're

832
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,520
only looking at hacking actions and the

833
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,200
varieties here you can see for espionage

834
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,360
the number one variety is exploit

835
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,600
vulnerability followed by use of back

836
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,840
door or command control and for

837
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,760
financial the number one variety there

838
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,760
for hacking is use of stolen credentials

839
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,760
followed by brute force and in the

840
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,679
inside there on the top right is vectors

841
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,039
it's another way that we can look at the

842
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,039
data going beyond the varieties we can

843
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,840
look at the vectors or the pathways or

844
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,120
or the methods or or i should say

845
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,440
the ways that threat actors are whatever

846
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,840
threat actors are using uh to gain

847
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,080
access using those varieties such as a

848
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,760
web application as you can see or

849
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,039
command shell

850
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,120
desktop sharing software for espionage

851
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,679
and web application desktop sharing and

852
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,720
backdoor c2 for uh the financial so

853
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,240
another way to look at the data the

854
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,240
results of uh

855
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,600
using the various framework or more

856
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,039
specifically

857
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,279
using the a4 threat model so this is

858
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,120
what it looks like behind the scenes if

859
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,720
you're interested in learning more

860
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,840
behind the scenes please go to

861
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,640
varuscommunity.net this is just again an

862
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,720
example of the hacking action variety

863
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,960
and the hacking action vector so we

864
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,600
define hacking this particular case on

865
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,159
the left hand side there and the columns

866
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,080
are in the middle and to the right the

867
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,840
three columns that you see first are the

868
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,919
hacking action varieties in the format

869
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,000
of action.hacking.variety

870
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,200
i underlined some of the ones that we

871
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,480
typically see over the years such as

872
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,679
brute force dos or denial service use of

873
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,399
backdoor c2 and then on the far column

874
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,480
is the

875
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,960
action.hacking.vector which is our

876
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,799
hacking action vectors

877
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,559
backdoor c2 are some of the more common

878
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,760
ones we see

879
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,840
desktop sharing as well as command shell

880
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,720
vpn and web application so it doesn't

881
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,960
look as as nice behind the scenes here

882
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,640
but this just gives you an idea of the

883
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,360
variety of different varieties for

884
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,000
hacking actions as well as vectors

885
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,919
that you can code if you're going to use

886
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,600
the varus framework knee for threat

887
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,399
model now of course this is uh by far

888
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,320
not everything that can occur out there

889
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,919
if you have something that's unknown and

890
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,840
you're not sure you can code it as

891
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,360
unknown and if it's other and it's not

892
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,080
fitting within the bullet bullet-sized

893
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,520
varieties and vectors here you can

894
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,840
certainly code it as other or you can

895
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,480
expand varus and start including newer

896
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,799
hacking varieties and vectors as

897
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,600
you know technology progresses

898
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,080
okay so let's look at an example of

899
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,720
using varus for coding so this is uh

900
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,880
vcdb coding so this is the varus

901
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,399
community database this is an open

902
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,960
source project where organizations folks

903
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,480
can use varus

904
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,640
code publicly disclose breaches and

905
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,960
incidents into the varus framework and

906
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,519
this is just a graphical example of a

907
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,880
famous um

908
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,399
or or a well-known case that involved uh

909
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,080
ransomware and specifically it's the

910
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,559
colonial pipeline so on the left-hand

911
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,120
side you can see an excerpt from an

912
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,080
article may 7th that outlines what

913
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,679
happened with the attack

914
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,600
it's great to read but it's very heavy

915
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,880
in terms of text if we use varus to code

916
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,559
what happened with that publicly

917
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,799
disclosed breach you can see the graphic

918
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,320
here in the middle and you know to the

919
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,480
right hand side of your screen here that

920
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,080
talks about the different components of

921
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,000
varus we've got victim demographics

922
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,480
there on the top left on the top right

923
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,240
our discovery method which was active

924
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,919
disclosure something that we typically

925
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,840
see with a ransomware attack

926
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,039
in the top

927
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,080
middle is attributes your

928
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,360
confidentiality integrity and

929
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,799
availability so was there data

930
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,399
disclosure absolutely yes that means

931
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,760
it's a breach what kind of data

932
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,320
varieties was it internal as well as

933
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,440
credentials

934
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,880
integrity was involving software

935
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,640
installation and the availability is

936
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,320
obscuration something we would see with

937
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,799
uh encrypted files the bottom left are

938
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,519
actor action and assets the three a's of

939
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,159
the four a4 threat model the top a

940
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,840
attributes is the fourth day so we can

941
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,159
see it's an external actor financial

942
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,960
motive using hacking and malware and

943
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,640
attacking a database and then you can

944
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,880
see the event chain there event one two

945
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,080
three and four walking through the

946
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,240
hacking the malware actions

947
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,919
telling the story from that standpoint

948
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,320
so just an example here of coding with

949
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,640
varus as i move through here another way

950
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,679
that you can use varus is the a4 uh grid

951
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,519
so taking those four components of the

952
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,240
a4 threat model the actors the actions

953
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,320
the assets and the attributes and

954
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,799
putting it into a grid here so

955
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,519
the very far left you can see assets dot

956
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,880
attributes that would be the yx axis and

957
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,960
the x-axis would be the actors dot

958
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,120
actions i believe i got that right x and

959
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,519
y and you can see how that you can pair

960
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,200
these up and then look at your

961
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,840
organization's incidents or breaches and

962
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,600
start filling in these squares to get a

963
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,840
heat map and giving you an idea of where

964
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,240
you need to focus your cyber defenses

965
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,559
and your detection response effort so

966
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,880
another tool that you can use for varus

967
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,840
finally here for varus we have the varus

968
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,240
framework here in the center which is

969
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,080
very good for incidents and breaches

970
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,600
that's what it's focused on it doesn't

971
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,159
get into attribution per se or some of

972
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,240
the more specific details in terms of

973
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,640
iocs or even counter measures or

974
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,320
controls so what we've done is we've

975
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,840
mapped the varus framework to miter

976
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,279
attack techniques you can see that on

977
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,440
the left hand side to help fill out

978
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,559
better what's happening with the

979
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,880
attacker activities and we've also

980
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,399
mapped varus framework to the assist

981
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,919
controls on the right hand side to

982
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,120
better

983
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,600
convey what countermeasures and controls

984
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,360
should be taken by a cyber defender so

985
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,799
we've been using assist controls for a

986
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,960
number of years in the dbir and we've

987
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,320
been using the minor attack techniques

988
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,399
for the last couple years in terms of

989
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,960
helping to show folks what's happening

990
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,480
out there with the threat actors

991
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,719
specifically

992
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,119
so various use cases so as you can see

993
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,239
we developed varus as a way to share

994
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,879
information a common framework a common

995
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,159
language for

996
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:24,879
for

997
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,879
for discussing events analyzing and

998
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,879
including in our dbir

999
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,960
this is something that we put together a

1000
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,399
number of years ago in the early days of

1001
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,399
the dbr that really help facilitate

1002
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,399
collection and analysis it's something

1003
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,239
that we've opened up to the public so as

1004
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,679
you can imagine

1005
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,679
it is a common framework at lingua

1006
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,918
franca for sharing information

1007
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,560
it's also codifiable or codifiable or

1008
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,800
very sizable and shareable from that

1009
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,960
standpoint

1010
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,960
it's good for metrics performance

1011
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,719
measurement risk management assessment

1012
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,639
resource justification and strategic

1013
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,680
planning

1014
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,760
a lot of organizations look forward to

1015
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,520
the release of the dvir every year so

1016
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,800
that they can do their strategic

1017
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,960
planning and resource justification but

1018
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,200
other organizations may use the dbr and

1019
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,119
or varus to help understand what's

1020
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,440
happening in their environment i

1021
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,040
mentioned the various community database

1022
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,720
previously that is one of the

1023
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,800
contributors to the dvir it's the only

1024
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,160
data set that you ever know who the

1025
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,160
attackers were or i'm sorry who the

1026
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,920
defenders were because it was publicly

1027
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,920
disclosed breaches so you can use the

1028
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,400
vcdb to compare and contrast what's

1029
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,160
happening in your environment in terms

1030
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,040
of looking at it through the varus lens

1031
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,960
we've also mapped to the cis controls as

1032
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,119
well as the minor attack

1033
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,040
and then finally you can use it simply

1034
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,040
for instant triage for your sock your c

1035
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,119
cert and your different teens and threat

1036
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,359
modeling for your cti attribution and

1037
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,599
your threat hunting

1038
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,440
so if you're interested in learning more

1039
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,200
there's some resources here the top

1040
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,119
three bullets are the dvir and the

1041
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,200
interactive website that i showed a

1042
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,280
couple screenshots from to include dvr

1043
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,760
fax figures and data the middle three

1044
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,280
bullets are specific to the varus

1045
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,800
framework the a4 threat model and the

1046
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
varus schema on variouscommunity.net and

1047
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,359
github.com and then finally the last

1048
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,079
three are the various community database

1049
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,320
varus web app and the varus coding style

1050
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,240
guide so we do have a web application

1051
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,400
that's that's available to code your

1052
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,160
incidents and your breaches within your

1053
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,720
environment into the varus web app

1054
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,000
it's something you can use internally

1055
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
and not share with anyone

1056
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,359
we do ask if you're interested in

1057
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,440
becoming a dbr contributor that you

1058
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,040
verifies your data first and you

1059
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,240
anonymize it varus is meant to um is

1060
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,079
built with uh with that in mind

1061
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,400
anonymizing the data before you send it

1062
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,560
to our data scientist for inclusion in

1063
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,880
the dvir that brings us to the end of

1064
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,280
the session

1065
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,880
and let's see if there's any any

1066
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,960
questions at all

1067
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,560
uh thank you very much john i'll

1068
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,200
get question at the end to

1069
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,839
deal with that

1070
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:58,160
that is awesome you just responded to

1071
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,400
a discussion that happened

1072
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,880
uh last last week about challenges in

1073
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,440
sharing event information

1074
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,760
and i'm very glad that we were able to

1075
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,960

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,000
very delighted to see how it realized

1077
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,040
with

1078
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,400
milo attack and cis control

1079
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
i think thank you very much you're very

1080

welcome thank you yeah so we talked

1081
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,359
about platform

1082
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,720
and uh john just presented

1083
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,960
uh about uh

1084
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,839
vocabulary and

1085
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,720
need to have a kind of common language

1086
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,440
for describing security accident

1087
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,760
in a structured and repeatable manner

1088
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,520
but where do you get those data

1089
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,599
i would like to invite

1090
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,520
pierre

1091
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,480
from shadow server foundation

1092
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,440
to

1093
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,240
talk to us about

1094
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,920
how shadow server contribute to

1095
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,440
[Music]

1096
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,120
coordinating last scale

1097
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,560
[Music]

1098
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,119
data collection and analysis

1099
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,480
and also

1100
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,280
uh

1101
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,079
shadow server work with c cert and

1102
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,440
various organizations uh pierre

1103
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,119

uh thank you for having me on in this

1106
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,839
session

1107
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,920
um yeah so my name is

1108
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,800
um can you see my my uh presentation in

1109
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,920
full screen

1110
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,720
just maybe yes we okay good

1111
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,200
so i'll talk about uh well uh shadow

1112
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,320
server and uh sharing uh free threat uh

1113
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,359
intelligence at scale uh this is mostly

1114
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:42,800
raw threat intelligence so you still

1115
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,359
have to do some processing um

1116
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,040
on the way up so to speak

1117
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,839
um but uh yeah i'll give an overview and

1118
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,800
uh also from the point of view of africa

1119
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,800
and and the arab region um as well

1120
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,320
uh so if you haven't heard of shadow

1121
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,000
server um shadow server is not for

1122
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,040
profit

1123
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,480
i'm working to make the internet more

1124
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,880
secure for everyone we are uh u.s based

1125
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,480
and netherlands based

1126
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,560
and we have been around for for well

1127
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,800
over 15 years already and

1128
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,880
have been well essentially

1129
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,920
giving data away for free to

1130
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,079
uh national sea certs and any

1131
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,000
organization that owns a network so is

1132
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,079
it an isp

1133
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,920
an enterprise a bank

1134
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,560
a university

1135
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,720
essentially anyone that has any any any

1136
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,119
address space assigned to them

1137
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,680
um we have many unique sources from many

1138
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,599
takedown operations conducted with law

1139
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,839
enforcement um we have a global vantage

1140
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,560
point and proven partnerships with

1141
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,320
many national seasides around the world

1142
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,720
law enforcement agencies and industry

1143
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,040
and security researchers worldwide most

1144
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,839
importantly what we share we share at no

1145
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,280
cost to the end user at all

1146
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,320
shadow server um

1147
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,480
collects a lot of information and we do

1148
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,760
it at at big scale uh there are very

1149
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,680
many data sets we collect at scale at

1150
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,359
shadow server these these just are a

1151
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,400
highlight

1152
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,480
of some of them um we are pretty well

1153
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,560
known for scanning the internet

1154
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,800
all the time so we have like the slide

1155
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,440
here is 45 but we actually have 68 scans

1156
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,680
running every single day

1157
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,560
um

1158
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,880
so we have a whole history of of the

1159
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,359
internet as it's seen from from from

1160
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,680
outside um with scanning for the last

1161
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,800
few years

1162
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,079
um we disrupt uh botnets

1163
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,359
we think all uh threats by typically by

1164
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,839
taking over over various uh domain names

1165
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,560
like used for criminal infrastructures

1166
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,359
and we direct them to our own um

1167
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,200
own infrastructure so we have insight

1168
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,680
into infected infected end users which

1169
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,200
we then share out

1170
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,040
we run sensor networks honeypots

1171
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,040
essentially thousands of honeypots all

1172
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,400
around the world running

1173
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,000
simultaneously

1174
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,839
which gives good insight into various

1175
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,800
iot related attacks or or

1176
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,599
attacks or oriented at web applications

1177
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,720
or any essentially any exposed service

1178
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,400
we collect malware data at scale um with

1179
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,880
over essentially a million uh unique by

1180
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,040
hash malware samples every single day

1181
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,040
for a total repository of 1.5 billion

1182
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,880
samples and we run these through

1183
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,160
sandboxes

1184
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,839
including our own proprietary ones so

1185
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,599
that gives insight into

1186
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,760
uh what the latest malware is doing

1187
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,640
um we collect uh digital we go at ssl

1188
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,200
certificates at scale so we have uh

1189
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
essentially like 50 60 million uh

1190
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,960
collected every single day that gives

1191
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,240
good insight into criminal

1192
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,160
infrastructure as well because criminals

1193
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,440
also use

1194
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,400
um ssl certificates to encrypt the

1195
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,359
traffic

1196
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,760
and all of this and while other data

1197
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,319
sets is around 12 metabs of of malware

1198
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,640
and threat intelligence stored and the

1199
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,800
results are shared with uh with network

1200
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,000
owners

1201
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,599
um

1202
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,280
so when any organization owes a network

1203
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,520
over six thousand and uh national c

1204
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,200
certs in uh in that cover 173 countries

1205
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,720
and territories

1206
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,200
and a lot of this is also used for for

1207
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,800
law enforcement uh investigations

1208
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,160
so our primary service uh and the one uh

1209
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,000
it's easiest to subscribe to it's

1210
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,319
everything is automated here are our

1211
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,800
reports and and there is no reason not

1212
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,480
to subscribe and get these reports

1213
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,480
because if we are seeing something uh

1214
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,560
then it's very likely a criminal actor

1215
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,319
is also seeing something and they can

1216
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,000
use uh these

1217
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,160
uh the things also that we find to

1218
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,760
actually get into your network and it's

1219
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,440
better to learn from us than from a

1220
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,800
ransomware note

1221
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,200
that you have been being compromised so

1222
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,079
no reason and not to not to subscribe

1223
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,720
um to give you an idea of the scale uh

1224
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,160
we see around 200 million for uh

1225
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,000
accessible open vulnerable services per

1226
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,560
day on average um and about 5 million

1227
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,640
affected addresses per day on average

1228
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,800
globally just in our sinkhole so that's

1229
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,280
without the honey plots dark nets or or

1230
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,440
or other means of observing observing

1231
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,640
attacks um for africa um around 2.2

1232
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,160
million accessible open vulnerable

1233
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,599
services that doesn't mean all of them

1234
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,839
are vulnerable but the ones once we can

1235
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:08,800
see and

1236
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,319
under certain circumstances they can be

1237
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,440
exploited

1238
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,079
and around 450 000 affected addresses

1239
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,400
per day on average in africa um the

1240
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,400
profile for africa is a bit different as

1241
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,160
you can see a larger percentage of

1242
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,760
devices infected is is like android um

1243
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,839
instead of like the more infrastructure

1244
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,280
server-side-based

1245
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,720
things we see in in europe or or the us

1246
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,280
um national seaside's receiving fees so

1247
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,440
countries in green have a national

1248
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,440
entity um receiving

1249
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,880
our data on a daily basis um as you can

1250
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,119
see here um

1251
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,960
there still is some work to do to do in

1252
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,640
africa although we have improved over

1253
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,720
over the last year in terms of uh

1254
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,800
outreach and we provide data to at least

1255
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,920
20

1256
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,319
national sea certs in africa but more

1257
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,359
more to cover there also also in

1258
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,680
in the arab states uh there is there is

1259
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,400
some area of improvement uh so uh like

1260
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,160
these are the latest um

1261
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:04,960
a

1262
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,520
list of countries within africa with

1263
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,599
missing c-certs getting data at the

1264
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,880
national level so this can be a

1265
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,560
government c-search or an entity set up

1266
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,119
as a national seaside or somebody acting

1267
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,280
um as a de facto national t-shirt if

1268
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,040
there is no no official no official

1269
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:19,920
presence

1270
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,400
if you have a contacts in any of these

1271
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,160
countries or are from any of these

1272
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,079
countries then please please let us know

1273
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,880
and maybe we can we can help out and and

1274
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,160
share data

1275
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:30,960
there

1276
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,760
similarly with with arab states uh

1277
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,839
there is there

1278
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,640
there are a few that that could have

1279
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,640
could receive data

1280
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,359
at the national level from us as well

1281
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:46,079
um these are direct report recipients so

1282
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,079
entities that have signed up directly to

1283
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,079
us so not national certs so you can see

1284
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,079
the numbers for for africa

1285
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,160
typically uh these numbers are well

1286
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,240
unfortunately uh pretty low just a few

1287
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,240
um entities in a country often

1288
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,560
multinationals that simply own eighty

1289
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,280
space also in in these countries

1290
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,160
um in africa predominantly south africa

1291
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,359
kenya

1292
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,040
um

1293
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,200
has had the most but essentially even

1294
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,040
larger countries like large countries

1295
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,200
like nigeria egypt i just just have a

1296
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,960
few entities

1297
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,960
receiving data directly so if you have

1298
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,160
like contacts with isps or other

1299
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,760
organizations that you think should be

1300
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,079
receiving our feeds directly just also

1301
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,839
please point them

1302
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,119
point them to us

1303
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,440
similarly for for the arab states

1304
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,400
coverage

1305
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,440
could be

1306
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,440
much better with the highest coverage

1307
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,359
game and then the emirates

1308
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,920
as such the other countries in egypt

1309
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,920
saudi arabia still

1310
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,920
pretty pretty low

1311
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,240
and this is an asn view of of all the

1312
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,079
asms out there that are assigned to

1313
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,839
africa that are actually receiving our

1314
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,000
data um

1315
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,079
and uh you can see in red essentially

1316
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,599
asms that are unfortunately not

1317
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,119
receiving

1318
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,160
data so uh well quite a lot uh to to

1319
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,079
improve here in in terms of giving data

1320
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:02,960
to

1321
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,200
directly to organizations without uh

1322
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,000
national certs uh as a proxy

1323
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,319
um it looks uh even worse for for arab

1324
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:13,680
states those arab league states um

1325
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,560
lots

1326
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,960
lots to improve here in the biggest

1327
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,040
telecoms um out there um as well

1328
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,920
um our reports are are described on our

1329
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,280
website uh every report is different

1330
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,280
they're approaching we're approaching 80

1331
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,920
um reports uh right now

1332
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,240
and essentially they they will report on

1333
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,040
infections vulnerabilities ddos attacks

1334
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,839
um uh essentially your assets that are

1335
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,560
exposed on a daily basis and in some

1336
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,800
cases there can be quite a lot of data i

1337
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,000
showed the

1338
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,720
total totals that we actually see for

1339
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,319
for for the continent and for the

1340
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,240
african continent and the world

1341
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,880
um one thing that you might want to know

1342
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,640
is that there are many optional reports

1343
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,160
that you can also request from us that

1344
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,079
you're probably not getting so if you're

1345
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,640
already subscribing to to our our data

1346
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,560
you should ask for a subscription to all

1347
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,680
the optional reports if you're

1348
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,000
interested and then you can have a good

1349
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,079
asset inventory that will essentially

1350
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,880
conduct for you on on a daily basis

1351
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,960
and we've also actually um started to

1352
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,680
introduce various ipv6 scans um this is

1353
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,760
slowly being rolled out um so you could

1354
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,319
probably subscribe to those as well and

1355
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,800
first of all we have an api that you can

1356
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,800
easily integrate with with your tools

1357
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,359
and and to fetch our data automatically

1358
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,599
or if you wish you can opt for the old

1359
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,079
delivery methods of emails and and web

1360
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:35,839
links

1361
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,440
example reports

1362
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,680
they have they are pretty well described

1363
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,000
i hope on the website each report has

1364
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,960
examples all the fields columns

1365
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,480
identified

1366
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,240
essentially all the reports are shared

1367
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,960
in csv formats or if you use the api you

1368
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,480
can also use

1369
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,400
json json formats

1370
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,960
subscribing is extremely easy there is

1371
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,880
no

1372
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,760
big process involved you just have to

1373
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,359
get in uh

1374
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,119
fill out the web form

1375
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,599
that that requests some basic

1376
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,680
information that we try also to use to

1377
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,000
verify your your identity

1378
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,240
and there is no formal agreement that

1379
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,000
you have to sign or anything like that

1380
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,720
if we verify you are who you are then

1381
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,960
you will get these this this data well

1382
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,480
pretty quickly

1383
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,400
so um there's lots of data sets that

1384
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,319
we're sharing and there's little time to

1385
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,480
actually uh go through that so so i

1386
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,720
won't um these are just some examples

1387
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,240
just an example like for vulnerable

1388
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,760
exchange servers there's lots of lots

1389
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,319
happening happening regarding half him

1390
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:39,440
and and and other actors uh um

1391
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,520
exploiting the the

1392
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,280
uh microsoft exchange vulnerabilities

1393
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,680
from the first quarter

1394
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,240
of the year and uh here is like an

1395
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,440
example data that you could have

1396
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,760
received if uh if you're subscribed at

1397
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,160
that time um essentially vulnerable

1398
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,400
um exchange servers also web shells this

1399
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,880
kind of information that we discovered

1400
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,680
um this is what africa looked like on at

1401
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,800
that at that time at uh at the time of

1402
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,880
that that incident with south africa

1403
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,520
being uh most exposed and then egypt uh

1404
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,480
second

1405
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,119
um other countries uh to a lower lower

1406
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,000
degree

1407
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,040
um similarly here for uh

1408
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,440
f4 for uh for more

1409
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,040
arab regions uh

1410
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,920
large focus like maybe in this case on

1411
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,720
on the emirates as as being the

1412
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,079
um primary affected uh entity but also

1413
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:33,040
saudi and and and others as well

1414
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,160
um our feeds uh well you can you can

1415
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,000
either write parsers for them uh but

1416
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,760
they're also of your own but there are

1417
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,680
also many open source tools

1418
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,760
that you can get

1419
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,240
to actually fetch fetch the data and

1420
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,920
they'll parse it normalize it for you

1421
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,720
automatically and also share it out

1422
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,880
with with your community many of these

1423
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,200
are very focused on the national c certs

1424
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,880
there are some gaps i think with tools

1425
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,640
for for isps for instance or other

1426
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,920
organizations

1427
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,000
that these tools could be adapted to

1428
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,400
handle but that's that's another story

1429
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,960
um you can also use uh commercial tools

1430
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,599
a number of these these these exist if

1431
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,119
you're interested in commercial tools

1432
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:12,720
and aren't aware of them you can also

1433
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,400
contact us and we can tell you which

1434
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,640
which exists

1435
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,520
as well if you don't want to use open

1436
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,839
source open source software

1437
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,200
which you should

1438
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,520
um one thing we also do for for

1439
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,520
community building is honeypot sensor

1440
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,160
networks so you're on a large-scale

1441
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,000
honeypot sensor networks honeypot

1442
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,440
service framework

1443
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,440
um where you could actually run a

1444
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,720
honeypot in in your network and get it

1445
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,559
essentially rapidly deployed in a

1446
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,880
thousand locations even

1447
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,079
worldwide

1448
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,400
within minutes essentially

1449
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,839
um

1450
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,079
and this is a project that that we run

1451
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,920
that currently uh

1452
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,599
has a number of different honeypot types

1453
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,559
operating proprietary ones as well as

1454
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,559
as well as open source ones

1455
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,160
um if you're interested in that please

1456
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,640
please contact us this is an example of

1457
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,720
the honeypot network that

1458
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,400
we are building a community honeypot

1459
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,760
network

1460
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,559
and

1461
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:10,880
well recently we've also been funded by

1462
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,160
the uk foreign commonwealth and

1463
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,160
development office to expand in africa

1464
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,319
and indo-pacific that was the start of

1465
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,000
the year and we have received funding to

1466
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,119
do it again

1467
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,119
so we will be looking for for four new

1468
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,240
locations also uh especially in africa

1469
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,240
and and also the commonwealth uh

1470
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,760
countries

1471
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,000
um africa in more detail where we have

1472
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,160
censors so you can see um south africa

1473
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,240
is pretty well covered

1474
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,480
um a few other countries like like kenya

1475
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,240
egypt um

1476
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,520
uh

1477
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,319
but lots lots more to be covered uh to

1478
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:43,599
be covered here

1479
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,599
um and this is all based on a framework

1480
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:48,000
that we developed uh for for european

1481
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,760
commission funded projects so we can

1482
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,599
have an example of how an eu project has

1483
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,000
also um impacted um

1484
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,559
the world hopefully um positively

1485
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,480
an example of how we collaborate with

1486
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,960
entities this is uh not not for africa

1487
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,880
but it's for latin america where we

1488
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,680
partnered with cydia and ecuador

1489
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,040
to install our sensors in latin america

1490
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,359
um we were interested also in similar

1491
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,280
partnerships in

1492
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,640
africa

1493
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,079
as well

1494
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,240
if you are able to host a sensor to help

1495
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,520
us help you

1496
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,559
um

1497
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:23,520
and and the community um this is

1498
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,760
all that's needed essentially a vm or

1499
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,319
physical machine with very low spec

1500
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:29,680
um

1501
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,119
it just needs to be a clean and clean

1502
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:32,400
ubuntu install

1503
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,880
um the biggest requirement for for for

1504
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,559
hosting a sensor is essentially uh

1505
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:41,359
at least two ipv4 addresses have have to

1506
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,440
be have to be assigned preferably more

1507
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,760
to actually run the honeypots one is

1508
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,440
used for is used for management

1509
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,720
um so we are trying to also to engage

1510
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,800
more and more in africa

1511
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,240
as mentioned we have had a

1512
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,319
sponsored project from the uk cdo now we

1513
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,559
have another ukfco project

1514
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,119
so we are seeking more national network

1515
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,240
owner

1516
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,800
subscriptions in africa as well as more

1517
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,200
collaboration on on the honeypots and

1518
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,200
we're thinking of you know how to focus

1519
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,520
in 2020 and make it easier to benefit

1520
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,160
from all our free services

1521
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,480
so some things related to to africa um

1522
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,520
that you can track on on our blog

1523
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,000
we plan to publish a new blog on the

1524
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,200
threat landscape in africa and

1525
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,079
that the current threat landscape as at

1526
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,400
least according to our data that's going

1527
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,480
to be published soon so hopefully we'll

1528
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,880
also offer offer some insight on what we

1529
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,319
see

1530
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,559
and finally to wrap up quickly um i

1531
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,200
think you know the data is is here is

1532
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,599
here for free uh it comes it's

1533
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,000
there is a lot of it um we collect we're

1534
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,440
probably the biggest supplier of free

1535
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,240
threat intel um worldwide i think if you

1536
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,720
haven't subscribed um then you should

1537
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,480
subscribe and if you're subscribing you

1538
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,000
should probably ask for more as for the

1539
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,480
optional reports if you haven't already

1540
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,800
um i think it's it's it's the best way

1541
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,680
to to actually um kickstart your cert if

1542
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,680
you don't have any or

1543
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,359
or if you're if you've just started or

1544
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,040
essentially even for uh for an advanced

1545
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,040
cert i think uh it's getting more and

1546
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,079
more important to have a good

1547
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,720
understanding of uh what assets they

1548
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,960
have to protect in in their country

1549
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,800
and now for instance we introduced a new

1550
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,319
device identification report that

1551
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,720
enables you to understand what vendors

1552
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,079
and what models you actually have

1553
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,760
deployed in your network or your

1554
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,599
countries to give you insight into what

1555
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,520
you're actually protecting i think

1556
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,359
that's that's a valuable report that's

1557
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:37,680
set on set up by default that you can

1558
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,079
also you can also get now

1559
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,799
um so that's a very quick spin uh

1560
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:46,960
through uh what uh what we offer um uh

1561
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,280
we're a bit short in time and we've run

1562
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,240
already

1563
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,400
so i hope this was a good a good

1564
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,640
oversight and um well if you have any

1565
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,440
questions or or or or something uh that

1566
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,680
you'd like to follow up uh please do

i think that

1574
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:16,720
a couple of

1575
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,480
countries

1576
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,440
that you mentioned about uh have not

1577
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,559
been receiving your feed yet uh online

1578
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:27,440
so this is the opportunity collect to

1579
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,400
engage with the computer and the shadow

1580
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,520
server

1581
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,559
uh to start receiving

1582
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:36,799
information related to your server

1583
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:38,160
ecosystem

1584
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,400
um something that i would also like to

1585
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,799
mention to you clearly is i understand

1586
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,359
that kovid has delayed a lot of project

1587
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:49,359
but i still believe that

1588
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:50,400
let's say

1589
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,880
god willing next year we should think

1590
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,720
about

1591
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,400
the project of conducting training

1592
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,160
related to

1593
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,680
proceeding those those feed that

1594
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,920
people are receiving it it will bring a

1595
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,680
lot of relevance

1596
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,079
in how different teams and different

1597
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,319
organizations receive and appreciate the

1598
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,640
information that they get for you and

1599
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,040
the different tools and arrangement that

1600
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,200
they can make iran's around that

1601
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,880
information

1602

running and

1606
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:34,079
deploying honeypot network so the way i

1607
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:37,280
understanding is and also from

andras presentation

1610
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:45,520
is that you can either receive it

1611
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,920
but you can also produce feed

1612

and he is currently leading the aptly

1633
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,920
community honeypot project

00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,640
and uh fellow uh panelists

1641
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,680
um i'm adly from ap nick and uh it's

1642
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,480
almost uh 3 30 a.m here but i'm still

1643
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,799
wide awake don't worry about that

1644
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,799
i'll take a few minutes to talk a bit

1645
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:10,640
about our community hanima project i

1646
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,240
think a lot of things have been said

1647
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,440
earlier

1648
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,119
i'm really happy to be here because i

1649
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:18,079
think some of our experience doing this

1650
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:19,839
activity here

1651
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:22,079
might be relevant to our counterparts in

1652
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:24,400
the african and arab region because i

1653
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,480
think there are lots of similarities in

1654
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,559
terms of the security communities

1655
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:29,920
activities

1656
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,520
the threat landscape and you know the

1657
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,839
mix nature of the maturity so some

1658
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:37,760
economies have you know very mature

1659
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,480
research very active security community

1660
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,839
there are some countries who are still

1661
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:44,000
developing the capabilities and lots and

1662
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,440
lots of interest in capacity development

1663
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:47,860
um

1664
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,440
[Music]

1665
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,760
we are the regional internet registry so

1666
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,240
our core business is not really security

1667
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,440
but we see

1668
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,359
capacity development and community

1669
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,359
engagement in this area

1670
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:02,240
as an important

1671
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,040
activity or initiative so

1672
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,960
part of my role is to do lots of

1673
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,480
engagement which means

1674
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,559
doing lots of training

1675
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:11,839
supporting

1676
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:14,640
sharing information and basically

1677
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,160
highlighting some of the things that

1678
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,760
were mentioned earlier by many of the

1679
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,599
speakers you know the free services by

1680
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,040
shadow server

1681
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,839
the uh miss prep threat sharing platform

1682
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:26,319
how to use it who's using it and what

1683
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:28,000
you know what is the benefit

1684
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,240
uh but the crowd or the audience that we

1685
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,400
are normally engaged with are the

1686
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,240
network operators which

1687
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,720
uh in most cases sometimes hold the key

1688
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:40,000
to fixing or doing resolution of any

1689
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,760
other cyber security incidents that we

1690
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,119
face

1691
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:44,480
at the same time there are also

1692
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,000
interests from governments regulators

1693
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
law enforcement agencies in many of the

1694
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,319
economies uh within the asia pacific

1695
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,319
region in terms of trying to understand

1696
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:56,880
what is really going on you know if and

1697
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,599
if we are trying to improve our security

1698
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,000
by developing strategies and whatnot

1699
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,799
what should we put in there so we find

1700
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:06,799
that there is a gap there where we can

1701
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,720
play an active role

1702
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,400
so through a lot of the capacity

1703
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,480
development activities that we do with

1704
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,280
this community member we thought about

1705
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,319
the honey net project as one of the um

1706
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:20,480
initiative that can actually

1707
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,400
help people think

1708
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,760
uh

1709
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,079
about security and also get involved in

1710
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,520
some of the security initiatives that

1711
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,599
are actively taking places all over the

1712
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:30,559
world

1713
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,760
so uh for the seasoned security uh

1714
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,920
person maybe you know you are wondering

1715
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,559
you know why honeypots i looked up when

1716
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:39,760
was the first time i spoke about

1717
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,359
honeypots at a first conference and i

1718
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,520
found that in 2009 i did a presentation

1719
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,559
on honeypots and detection however in

1720
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,640
our context of the epinephrine community

1721
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,559
honeynet project

1722
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,960
it is more for creating awareness i

1723
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,400
think earlier there was a presentation

1724
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,000
that talks about maturity which is a

1725
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,920
combination of awareness

1726
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,920
when you can do then you can do you have

1727
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,880
capacity and capability to do certain

1728
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,920
things

1729
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,000
we find that in our engagement yes you

1730
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,240
know people have been dealing with a lot

1731
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,720
of security issues but in a lot of cases

1732
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,839
the person behind the computer

1733
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:16,640
is not that experienced or completely

1734
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,359
new to the field so

1735
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:20,400
by

1736
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,880
going into the honey pots and when i say

1737
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,280
honey pots we do actually do training uh

1738
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,599
using honey pots uh where people can

1739
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:29,440
actually see the attacks

1740
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,680
and the artifacts and from there you

1741
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,680
know they can do some analysis they can

1742
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,079
appreciate how this works in

1743
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:37,280
detection

1744
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,640
um understand a bit of about forensics

1745
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,720
uh you know risk management and so on

1746
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,920
and so forth

1747
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,079
um we started to do the training back in

1748
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,520
2014 at bd dong so network operatives

1749
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,319
group uh meeting in in bangladesh where

1750
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:54,480
there's a bunch of isps

1751
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,200
and it became one of the one of the hit

1752
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,039
training i would say

1753
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:00,880
since then and

1754
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,640
what happens normally after each

1755
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,480
training is people would be interested

1756
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,000
in deploying their own honey pots and

1757
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,359
would like to

1758
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,359
share information and learn more so we

1759
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:12,960
thought this was a good excuse for us to

1760
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,359
set up this community of people who are

1761
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:18,160
running honey pots

1762
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,200
and

1763
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,599
nothing much is expected of

1764
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:22,880
them and

1765
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,559
other than you know setting up a

1766
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:26,240
honeypot and then you know let's do some

1767
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,079
things together basically

1768
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,559
um i find also that over time it helps

1769
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,880
us to you know go into some of the more

1770
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,039
advanced topic uh or some of the current

1771
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:36,880
topics that everyone is discussing today

1772
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,880
like the micro attack framework so we

1773
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,640
can easily relate to what people are

1774
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,400
seeing in their own honey pots into hey

1775
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,079
this is what micro framework is talking

1776
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:47,599
about and let's let's look at your data

1777
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:48,640
for example we've been trying to

1778
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,400
encourage people to go to the next step

1779
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,039
by other than collecting information how

1780
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:54,880
about we start a community that share

1781
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,760
information uh proactively

1782
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,520
through ms

1783
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,200
and things like that

1784
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,720
and i think most importantly the main

1785
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,359
message is let's be proactive and take

1786
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:08,000
action before an incident happens

1787
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,400
or let's be more aware about what we do

1788
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,000
in hardening our environment and

1789
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,079
infrastructure and customers

1790
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:15,839
so that you know when people need to

1791
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:18,160
reach out to us we are ready to help uh

1792
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,079
and even before people are reaching out

1793
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:22,480
to us then we are already processing

1794
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,160
information and taking action and

1795
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,480
investing some time in security

1796
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,960
this is my last slide uh so what is the

1797
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,319
current state of the project so

1798
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:33,599
fortunately um the the folks at ap nick

1799
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:34,880
are very supportive about this

1800
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,440
particular project uh because we find

1801
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,200
that this is a very good excuse for us

1802
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,760
to do multiple engagements

1803
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,280
and to focus on various areas

1804
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,119
we use a lot of open source tools and

1805
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:49,359
you know all props and shout out to all

1806
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,520
the open source tools developers out

1807
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,400
there

1808
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,799
we are thinking of ways to hopefully

1809
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:56,640
support and fund some of these projects

1810
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,079
in the future so that there is

1811
01:03:58,079 --> 01:03:59,599
continuity

1812
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:01,119
and it will help the developers to

1813
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:03,760
enhance the project that we use for free

1814
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,640
um

1815
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,880
there's been some collaboration as well

1816
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,920
at our end mainly with large isps

1817
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,799
universities and some national assets

1818
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,400
and of course we are venturing into

1819
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,240
trying to create smaller communities

1820
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,319
where people can proactively share

1821
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:20,799
threat information uh even if they don't

1822
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:23,119
run honeypots so that's kind of the next

1823
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:26,799
steps that we are thinking of over time

1824
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:28,799
we have started to share feeds outside

1825
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:31,039
the asia pacific community we started to

1826
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:32,960
share some small feeds to with shadow

1827
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,240
server

1828
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,680
and and mis

1829
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,280
internally at ap unique there is a

1830
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,520
project that that is called dash that

1831
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:43,119
provides insights uh on network

1832
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:45,119
belonging to our members

1833
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:46,640
so they can see if there is any

1834
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,280
suspicious traffic uh or traffic going

1835
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,440
to the honeypots as well as other

1836
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,920
information about what routing security

1837
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,280
and all of that

1838
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,359
um the main outcome of this honeynet

1839
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:58,799
project has been in the capacity

1840
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:00,240
development activities as mentioned

1841
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,960
earlier talks workshops um including at

1842
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,760
ap cert taxon and many other security

1843
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,839
events in the region

1844
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,520
and as i mentioned earlier that one of

1845
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:12,160
our concern is a lot of it a lot of

1846
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,920
these tools that we use for free they

1847
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,160
are being developed on people's free

1848
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,359
time

1849
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:19,440
and what can we do as a community to

1850
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,440
then support them so that's one of the

1851
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,079
areas that we are trying to help support

1852
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:25,280
and improve

1853
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,440
uh other than just running honeypots as

1854
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,559
well

1855
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,240
and with that i would like to end my

1856
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,799
presentation and if anyone would like

1857
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:34,559
more details on the implementation

1858
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:35,599
because i don't think you have the time

1859
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:36,400
for that

1860
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,079
please reach out to me i'm more than

1861
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:40,720
happy to share information and

1862
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,240
maybe share some of the lessons learned

1863
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,000
that we have experienced in running this

1864
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:44,960
project

1865
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,319
so john robert that's my short

1866
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,960
presentation over to you thank you thank

1867

thank you

1870
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,520
um a lot of things that we can learn

1871
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,920
from the ethnic experience and that we

1872
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,440
can replicate

1873
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,880
within the

1874
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,359
african internet community

1875
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:08,880
thank you for

1876

you need to understand how

1881
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,480
a similar initiative can be deployed in

1882
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,640
the african continent i'm very confident

1883

uh opportunity to just share my

1917
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,119
experience

1918
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:57,119
in regards to cyber threat intelligence

1919
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:00,799
so i will try to be as brief as adley he

1920
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:02,799
has set a very

1921
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:05,839
a good trend

1922
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,680
so

1923
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,079
my talk and discussion will basically

1924
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:13,200
revolve around what i've done in regards

1925
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,720
to

1926
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,520
uh establishment of such especially in

1927
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,319
the african market having worked with

1928
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,000
the itu

1929
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,439
on a few projects so most of the

1930
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:27,198
speakers that have uh

1931
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:29,359
just come before me are starting from

1932
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:31,839
the morning session we have talked a lot

1933
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:35,759
about uh existing frameworks

1934
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,479
uh we have talked a lot about

1935
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:41,759
consumption of cyber threat intelligence

1936
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:43,198
i want to take

1937
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:45,520
a slightly different

1938
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,560
angle

1939
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,880
and actually tackle honor

1940
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,399
how we can

1941
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:52,399
generate cyber threat intelligence

1942
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:54,640
specifically i would focus on the

1943
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,880
african uh context

1944
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,279
i just a quick question

1945
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:01,759
right now we have i believe around 54

1946
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:04,719
countries in africa

1947
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:08,238
in your own time just try to

1948
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:11,279
find how many of those countries are one

1949
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,920
have such and two how many of those

1950
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,319
countries actually generating any form

1951
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:20,799
of a cyber threat or intelligence

1952
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:22,238
a lot of us

1953
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:24,880
uh specifically such and just even

1954
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,238
organizations

1955
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:28,000
i believe for the last

1956
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,640
ten or ten years or so we have been

1957
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,520
doing a very good job consuming cyber

1958
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,679
threat intelligence we have

1959
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:39,520
matured processes matured platform

1960
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,679
that have done a very good job in line

1961
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:44,880
two supporting at the user however more

1962
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,238
often or not

1963
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:49,279
i've come across a question

1964
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:50,719
by search

1965
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,640
by the actual practitioners either

1966
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,640
manning these arts basically asking us

1967
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,880
or asking me in certain cases that

1968
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,600
how can we start consuming

1969
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,400
and

1970
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,199
one generating our own feed sender

1971
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,280
consuming those feeds and

1972
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,719
sharing those feeds with the other peers

1973
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:11,440
so the question here comes to

1974
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:15,520
how do we generate relevant cti

1975
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,679
in an environment where we have

1976
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:20,560
technical uh challenges in regards to a

1977
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,560
competency's point of view

1978
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,920
where budget politics and trust

1979
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,400
play a role and in most cases

1980
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,199
these four are always trying to

1981
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:33,040
slow you down

1982
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,000
now before you handle but that list let

1983
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:36,960
me just

1984
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,400
go back and reiterate a few things that

1985
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,520
i've shared

1986
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,040
and just attached on i believe it's a

1987
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:50,480
fact that ck consumption has matured

1988
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,239
all the speakers from the morning

1989
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:56,239
session are actually proof for this

1990
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,199
a lot of platforms a lot of frameworks a

1991
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:01,840
lot of maturity models all geared

1992
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,040
towards that these are common goal

1993
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:08,719
cta sharing platform also have a mature

1994
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:11,360
miss pizza playing a very important role

1995
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:14,159
now and it's just not only missed

1996
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:16,800
other players are coming into the market

1997
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,719
are 12 days

1998
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:20,159
however

1999
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:23,199
cti generation in most cases

2000
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:25,520
has always been centered

2001
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,719
around

2002
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,040
deploying honeypot so deploy this

2003
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,600
honeypot deploy that honeypot under and

2004
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,000
you get cti

2005
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
this bets the question

2006
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,480
are we finding ourselves in a situation

2007
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,679
where we have these amazing ferraris

2008
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:43,120
amazing cars

2009
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:46,080
but you are lacking competent competent

2010
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,840
drivers who can actually actualize the

2011
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,560
benefit these ferraris are meant to

2012
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,360
offer the community of assets or any

2013
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,719
other organizations who might be

2014
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:59,679
interested into generating their own a

2015
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:00,880
cyber threat

2016
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,600
intelligence

2017
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,320
having that in mind still comes back to

2018
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:09,199
our question how do we ensure that

2019
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:12,159
organization sites are able to generate

2020
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:17,440
relevant cti ah in their environment

2021
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,678
so

2022
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,840
i won't i won't definitely not want to

2023
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,920
bore everyone with that they all uh

2024
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,800
threat intelligence generation framework

2025
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,560
and cycle and all that

2026
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,640
i'm going to choose to focus on three

2027
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,080
aspects

2028
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,400
planning direction and

2029
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,679
collection specifically when uh

2030
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:39,920
you are thinking of

2031
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,560
generating threat intelligence

2032
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,120
so first

2033
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,120
in these discussions

2034
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,360
one of the key thing that comes out or

2035
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,600
that came out even in my engagement is

2036
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,360
that

2037
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,600
as an organization as a search you need

2038
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,000
to know your constituency and

2039
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,840
what is important and

2040
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,840
relevant to them

2041
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,159
i'll give an example so one of the

2042
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:06,159
national assets you're actually working

2043
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:09,920
with they had multiple constituencies

2044
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:14,320
and each constituency was very specific

2045
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,840
in regards to the kind of

2046
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,760
intelligence one they want to generate

2047
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,120
and are interested are interested in so

2048
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,120
for one constituency they are more

2049
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,640
interested in

2050
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:30,000
can we get visibility on everything

2051
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,239
related to http traffic related to api

2052
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:36,560
another constituency

2053
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,960
different approach for them they are

2054
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:43,280
implicit in rdp ssh when you also get

2055
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,120
people who are

2056
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,480
playing are in the ot space totally

2057
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:49,600
different

2058
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,520
a requirement

2059
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,320
planning and direction also helps build

2060
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,080
on top of what other speakers have

2061
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,040
mentioned

2062
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:01,840
public private partnership as i said

2063
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,000
i sound corrected but it's virtually

2064
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,520
impossible for you to have a meaningful

2065
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,440
visibility

2066
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,799
uh in regards to census

2067
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,960
for all your traffic because

2068
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,880
you have the private sector doing their

2069
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,440
own things you have the uh the academia

2070
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,760
doing their own things in regards to

2071
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,880
traffic the only way these you get this

2072
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:29,760
visibility is by actually engaging and

2073
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,480
working with this uh public-private

2074
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,760
partnership

2075
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,560
then there's that aspect over shared

2076
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,080
prosperity

2077
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,159
for this specific search

2078
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:42,560
one of the main thing that actually

2079
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:43,600
helped

2080
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:47,120
uh this collaboration was they shared a

2081
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:50,159
prosperity basically telling one

2082
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:52,560
constituency that whatever you are

2083
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,840
generating is going to help someone else

2084
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,719
whatever they are working on is also

2085
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:01,120
going to come and circle back and

2086
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,400
help you

2087
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,120
so that was a game changer

2088
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,760
then threat modeling so threat modeling

2089
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,520
basically goes back to planning and

2090
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,280
direction in that

2091
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,920
each constituency might be facing

2092
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,960
different threats and it's only helpful

2093
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,480
and meaningful for them to actually

2094
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,840
collect intelligence related to their

2095
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,760
threat modeling

2096
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,600
now if

2097
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,840
having figured out the planning and

2098
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,640
direction phase the most

2099
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,880
important thing now is

2100
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,880
the collection

2101
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:35,760
how

2102
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,760
are we going to use

2103
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,920
the planning phaser

2104
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,440
input

2105
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:46,400
and direct it to the collection office

2106
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,800
so i will skip these i this laser

2107
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,560
keeps appearing because

2108
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,880
the main point is the

2109
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,159
pointer is being able to collect these

2110
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:00,880
relevant cti

2111
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,120
so

2112
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:06,400
the constituency model basically

2113
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,960
works on the stakeholder approach i

2114
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,480
believe that's one of the approach that

2115
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,920
has also been championed by isoc

2116
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,920
now when i'm when when you're looking at

2117
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,239
this multistakeholder approach one of

2118
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:19,440
the main thing

2119
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,920
i advocate for and i've seen some good

2120
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,440
success with is

2121
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,520
going horizontal so basically going

2122
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,159
horizontal basically means that as i

2123
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:29,920
said

2124
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,840
instead of uh

2125
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,960
trying to lift this heavy burden

2126
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,480
utilize

2127
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,960
what is already existing

2128
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,239
so

2129
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:42,719
trust has been one of those key things

2130
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:45,920
that has been mentioned through this out

2131
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,440
as an organization a it is hard for

2132
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:52,640
organization b to trust me either we

2133
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:55,040
haven't had this kind of engagement

2134
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,760
before however

2135
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,199
both a and b will easily trust a

2136
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:04,320
national a national center a national

2137
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,000
entity

2138
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,440
so going horizontal is all about public

2139
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:12,800
private partnership being championed by

2140
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,159
a national entity with focus on i shared

2141
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:16,880
a

2142
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,719
prosperity

2143
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,800
so identifying your constituency as i've

2144
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,239
said that you can't do this

2145
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:26,640
alone

2146
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,480
each different constituency each

2147
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,040
stakeholder in that constituency will in

2148
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,600
most cases have visibility that you

2149
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,440
might not have

2150
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,360
additionally they also might have

2151
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:40,719
competencies that you you might not have

2152
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:41,520
so

2153
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,719
instead of

2154
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:46,400
trying to reinvent everything and

2155
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,679
build everything from ground up identify

2156
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:52,400
the right stakeholder then i work with

2157
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,360
them

2158
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,520
communication and

2159
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,800
identify the various champions so i

2160
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,679
believe for this particular search

2161
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:04,159
when you are rolling out this

2162
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,960
a deployment

2163
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,280
one of the main thing that actually

2164
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,480
helped on board the various

2165
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,760
constituencies and cement the

2166
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,960
trustworthy the kind of communication

2167
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,360
they sat harder with this constituency

2168
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:20,880
so these were

2169
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,159
a mix of uh physical meetings virtual

2170
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:26,960
meetings where the constituency were

2171
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,320
given the platform to ask questions

2172
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,560
ask the technical questions the

2173
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,880
executive question just for them to

2174
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,159
understand

2175
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:38,000
what the search wanted to do and how

2176
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,400
that technology was actually

2177
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,760
going to happen

2178
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:45,840
and through asking of these questions

2179
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:49,280
people are also able to fully understand

2180
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,080
and

2181
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:52,320
appreciate what the site was actually

2182
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,520
trying to achieve this resulted in

2183
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:58,560
fostering of transparency and just

2184
01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,840
building and

2185
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,880
gaining more trust because

2186
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,440
people will really

2187
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,360
like change

2188
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:10,080
if you're going to introduce changer

2189
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,960
and there is insufficient communication

2190
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:15,440
you basically introduce a stumbling

2191
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,159
block in your path however

2192
01:19:18,159 --> 01:19:20,840
if you introduce change and you clearly

2193
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,120
communicate change at this particular

2194
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,199
change to the people you're going to

2195
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:28,239
work to the absorption rate greatly

2196
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:31,919
greatly i increases

2197
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:35,120
uh moving on

2198
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,679
so the other thing that uh in addition

2199
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:39,840
to basically communicating

2200
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,679
one of the other things that we actually

2201
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:44,960
did was to reduce and eliminate the

2202
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,840
learning and management overhead

2203
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,679
so in most cases

2204
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:51,840
this most constituency and most

2205
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,000
stakeholders you'll be working they

2206
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,199
won't want to increase the technical

2207
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:59,120
overload they might be having they don't

2208
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,000
want

2209
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,199
to learn new ways to deploy something

2210
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:04,400
or

2211
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,440
figure how to actually deploy a solution

2212
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,920
a strategy that actually worked for us

2213
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,840
was creating

2214
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,360
very simple manuals to set up sensors so

2215
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,199
you basically tell

2216
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:18,560
this particular

2217
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,000
stakeholder that once you get

2218
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,320
the sensor configuration run these two

2219
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,480
commands

2220
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,480
everything works

2221
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,159
then secondly

2222
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,560
one of the thing that we actually

2223
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:36,719
capitalize on open source has been

2224
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:39,199
has been mentioned multiple times here

2225
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:42,000
so think over for instance creating

2226
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,639
simple docker compose files create a

2227
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:46,560
simple docker compose file

2228
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,560
i tell uh

2229
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,560
the partner you're working with in this

2230
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,320
particular constituency

2231
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,639
run this particular commander and at

2232
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:57,360
this sensor i will be set up

2233
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:00,000
so there's that fact of reducing and

2234
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,239
completely eliminating that learning and

2235
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:04,639
management overhead was

2236
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:07,199
very very beneficial because at the end

2237
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:08,719
of the day

2238
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:11,360
the constituency definitely are going to

2239
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:12,960
benefit from this

2240
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,320
however at the same time you don't want

2241
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,280
to labor them with that aspect over now

2242
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,520
you need to learn docker now you need to

2243
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,719
do a bcnd if they do it well and good

2244
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:27,199
but they should not shoulder that

2245
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:30,159
particular responsibility

2246
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:33,120
now praising is always going to be i

2247
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:33,840
mean

2248
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,080
a major issue

2249
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:38,239
one way to solve this is

2250
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:41,520
go very affordable and one way to go

2251
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,159
in a very affordable way either actually

2252
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:47,040
using authors

2253
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,199
so for these particular sensors and

2254
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:52,159
honeypots we actually went with the

2255
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:53,840
docker so we had

2256
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,600
docker containers

2257
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,440
then build on top of el canda i missed

2258
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:02,239
just to ensure that the cost that

2259
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:05,520
uh each the cost the cost basically that

2260
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,320
the sat was in carry was very minimal

2261
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,880
especially when it came to the technical

2262
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:15,520
aspect of a setting up setting up these

2263
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,120
then

2264
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,840
having done that so

2265
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,840
you have reduced already

2266
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,679
eliminated at the learning cover

2267
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:28,400
the prices the financial implication is

2268
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:29,760
very low

2269
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,360
how do you now

2270
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,000
make use of existing cyber threat

2271
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,679
intelligence

2272
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:37,040
now the existing cyber threat

2273
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:40,080
intelligence is still meaningful as much

2274
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,760
as you are even creating your own

2275
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,159
intelligence there is no need to

2276
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:45,679
reinvent the will

2277
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:49,360
one approach to use is actually

2278
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,040
integrate your

2279
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,600
the city you are generating with

2280
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,639
existing cti and i'm i was very very

2281
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,239
pleased and happy

2282
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:01,760
to see the tunisian search team actually

2283
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,639
doing something similar to that where

2284
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:07,840
they basically integrate showdown with

2285
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,760
what they are getting i don't know maybe

2286
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,800
to reduce false positive or just to

2287
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,760
further enrich uh enrich the cgi that

2288
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,440
they are getting

2289
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:18,239
now

2290
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:21,360
all of these the main goal is to

2291
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,960
actually get something similar like this

2292
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,880
so

2293
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,880
at the uh

2294
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,280
at the bottom here we have the various

2295
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,880
constituencies

2296
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,520
in each constituency

2297
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:39,280
you only deploy one sensor one sensor

2298
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,520
running on a physical hardware which can

2299
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,760
be virtualized

2300
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,000
now in this physical hardware to ensure

2301
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,800
we are maximizing all the resources we

2302
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,360
have because that also translates into

2303
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,880
budget

2304
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:56,239
localizer everything you want to do so

2305
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:59,280
in this particular case i believe

2306
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:02,480
we had one sensor running more than a

2307
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:06,719
five independent honeypots each custom

2308
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:09,040
developed for that particular

2309
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:11,520
constitution constituency

2310
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,760
now given that we are running and the

2311
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:17,760
minimizing cost so the sensor was a very

2312
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,440
basic uh

2313
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,120
machine

2314
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,800
no premium as a specification

2315
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,679
now everything from the sensor was being

2316
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:28,840
shipped to

2317
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:32,800
i was actually being shipped to

2318
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,679
the search endpoint server a dedicated

2319
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:38,880
server where all the heavy lifting was

2320
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,840
being done now from this server all this

2321
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,719
information was being enriched with

2322
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:47,600
additional cti's trauma

2323
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,239
other external partners

2324
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:52,560
necessarily are part of that

2325
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:56,320
constituency now where the constituency

2326
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:59,199
felt the value and benefited from this

2327
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:01,199
was that

2328
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:04,719
each constituency was actually able to

2329
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:06,639
access those feeds

2330
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:09,920
via an access ba a role-based access

2331
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,560
control system so in this case

2332
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:15,120
you ship your logs

2333
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,760
from the honeypot the honeypot reaches

2334
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,199
the

2335
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:22,239
uh the such infrastructure such does any

2336
01:25:22,239 --> 01:25:24,800
analysis enrichment that needs to be

2337
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:25,600
done

2338
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,719
then as a constituency you are able to

2339
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:32,960
actually make use make sense of that

2340
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,639
particular information

2341
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:35,840
that you have

2342
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,280
collected

2343
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,080
