[Music]

57
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,080
computer board uh in mauritius and which

58
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,480
is a

59
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,640
statutory body

technology communication and and

62
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,519
innovation so

63
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,360
many of you may know that

64
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,040
russian third is the second oldest

65
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,640
certain in

66
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,280
africa now we were set up uh in 2008 and

67
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,040
just let's say uh

68
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,959
after uh donation

69
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,640
to uh tonset

70
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,200
uh is the first certain in in africa and

71
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,720
normally what we do is that we being the

72
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,000
national institute

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,840
we are driving the

74
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,280
national uh cyber security initiatives

75
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,560
in the country

76
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,640
and in particular i talked about if

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,480
let's say capacity building so

78
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,480
mauritians is also driving and operating

79
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,920
the itu center of excellence since 2020

80
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,440
and under that

81
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,080
unless the center we have been doing uh

82
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,239
different types of car training programs

83
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,000
for mauritius as well as

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,200
for the countries in the uh uh region

85
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,760
especially uh in southern africa and

86
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,280
eastern africa

87
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,440
as well as uh there are participants who

88
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,720
are joining from

89
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,879
all parts of the world into those

90
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,720
training programs which have been

91
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,040
organized so far

92
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,720
and also being an actions

93
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,120
we assist the ministry of information

94
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,720
technology

95
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,640
in the development of

96
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,040
different uh cyber security frameworks

97
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,760
including strategies and the policies

98
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,920
uh and this is where uh

99
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,640
we are also uh let's say

100
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,200
uh extensively involving doing that

101
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,319
and uh we are also the first member

102
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,080
since

103
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,599
2010 so uh

104
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,159
this is a little bit about us and that

105
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,680
who we are and what we are doing and uh

106
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,120
we are

107
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,840
let's say with the

108
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,320
first for quite some time and and we are

109
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,639
very much involved into the activities

110
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,720
of first um which are happening uh from

111
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,479
let's say uh since 2010.

112
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,919
so coming back to uh today's uh

113
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,759
exercise and

114
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,400
uh the whole uh training program uh this

115
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,960
is uh like uh national cyber crisis

116
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,040
management uh plan in particular we'll

117
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,320
be talking about

118
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,080
and that's just the structure like if

119
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,000
you look at the structure

120
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,960
so the structure talks about uh three

121
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,199
things in particular uh we want to talk

122
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,000
about

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,080
and and the first one is an introduction

124
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,040
to a national uh cyber crisis management

125
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,919
plan so what is the national cyber

126
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,680
crisis management plan

127
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,320
why it is required what is needed

128
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,840
and and

129
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,720
how it is activated who are the people i

130
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,000
should be activating into this let's say

131
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
uh national crisis management uh

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
framework once we set it up uh how do we

133
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,960
let's say

134
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,800
have those different types of teams

135
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,120
which are set up

136
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,800
uh in any particular uh national cyber

137
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,600
crisis management uh plan how these uh

138
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,880
teams they should be interacting

139
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,759
together

140
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,720
once there is any incident of national

141
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,840
significance so the idea here is

142
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,440
talking around

143
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,400
how

144
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
we will be able to develop that program

145
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,960
we will also be talking let's say from

146
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,320
the

147
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
experience of

148
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,479
plan implementation how we have

149
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,320
implemented this particular plan and

150
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,800
maybe uh what also we will uh would like

151
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,919
to do is that we will try to

152
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,639
keep this uh training of uh very

153
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,000
interactive so

154
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,680
uh we're gonna stop in

155
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,160
uh let's say uh participants they can

156
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,280
always ask that

157
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,280
how can we go about it and and and and

158
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,440
how it is done so we can keep on talking

159
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,440
so rather than because since it's a

160
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,520
four-hour screening

161
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,919
is this is a topic of uh much more than

162
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,160
that we are delivering the screening of

163
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,759
over uh nine hours two hours uh into the

164
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,560
our itu center of excellence but since

165
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,639
uh it's just four hours training program

166
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,520
so we try to be a focus discussion where

167
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,919
we are able to make you understand uh

168
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,080
what this plan is all about how will you

169
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,280
be able to design this plan and then

170
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,639
how you'll be able to implement this

171
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,960
plan and then actually ask how you'll

172
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,759
so that's the part of the introduction

173
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,479
uh second part here is that uh inside

174
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,160
the plan so incident response

175
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,400
so why incident what

176
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,479
is the response

177
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,520
is set up into ixp anything set up in

178
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,319
runs and steam is set up into

179
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,560
let's say any other organization any

180
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,960
team is set up even

181
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,840
a product suits so this this applies and

182
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,960
responses but here at the end of the day

183
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,280
the focus is could be let's say an

184
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,280
actual orientation where

185
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,639
how national cyber crisis management

186
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,960
plans are developed we need to say again

187
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,639
that who could be different stakeholders

188
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,080
here

189
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,960
and and how these stakeholders they are

190
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,199
connecting together in order to execute

191
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,280
that plan so what is the incident

192
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,960
response team in that what is the

193
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,280
communication team into that how these

194
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,400
tips are

195
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,919
connecting together

196
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,120
in order to address if there is any

197
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,319
crisis situation into the country so i

198
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,039
think

199
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,800
that's that's the approach we are

200
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,199
talking about so incident response and

201
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,360
here also because a parallel training

202
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,120
right now is running uh which talks

203
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,319
about incident response and

204
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,719
classification so this also connects

205
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,599
here so some of uh the

206
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,799
participants who are here they might

207
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,958
have seen that when you also but our

208
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,279
focus is to connect incident response

209
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,760
and classification how in devising the

210
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,320
national cyber crisis management plan uh

211
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,480
rather than just focusing what instant

212
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,800
response is and how incidents are

213
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,040
classified because at the end of the day

214
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,279
what also we need to understand is that

215
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,000
incident a classification is very very

216
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,480
important once we are talking about a

217
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,440
national cyber crisis because depending

218
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,760
on to the classification only you'll be

219
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,600
able to address

220
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,000
those incidents so that's where we will

221
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,720
be exclusively talking here about

222
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,519
incident response and the national

223
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,920
approach which should be taken for

224
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,560
incident response and especially dealing

225
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,240
with the situation of cyber crisis

226
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,399
and the last part here is the testing

227
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,800
implementation and maintaining the plan

228
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,120
so how do we test how do we implement

229
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,160
and how do we maintain and and that's

230
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,530
an example

231
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,720
[Music]

232
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,440
i think we can just uh take it and and

233
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,800
and this example uh is is all about the

234
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,080
the implementation so in implementation

235
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,240
uh and testing different uh things we

236
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,959
could do we can do some sort of uh

237
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,480
simulation exercises we can do some tdx

238
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,040
where uh these kind of plans they are

239
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,600
tested to see and another important

240
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,120
point which we are going to discuss in

241
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,560
lsc

242
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,200
this training program is is also about

243
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,720
the governance so

244
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,880
yes this is a national cyber crisis

245
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,880
management plan but how is it has to be

246
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,839
governed because a crisis situation is a

247
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,399
situation where we need to have a proper

248
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,640
governance structure so that at any

249
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,040
point of time if there is such a

250
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,399
situation into your country then there

251
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,600
is a full flooded structure in order to

252
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,079
deal with that and and this means that

253
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,720
that there is a committee there there

254
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,440
there

255
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,320
there is

256
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
let's say a team sitting together so

257
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,240
team sitting together shared by somebody

258
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,760
so it means that if it's a national

259
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,000
responsibility then normally what we

260
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,720
expect that the top person uh cheers

261
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,760
that because then there's more

262
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,839
commitment and then the execution of

263
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,160
things that happens much more easily as

264
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,040
compared to if somebody let's say

265
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,600
is cheering that governance let's say uh

266
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,440
committee uh where

267
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,680
the person is less influential in a way

268
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,680
so this we can discuss so it's not

269
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,920
subjective but that's that's something

270
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,760
what we have been uh let's say uh doing

271
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,200
here and what we have done and this is

272
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,959
what we have been talking to people so

273
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,040
uh this is what uh the test

274
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,360
implementation and and maintaining their

275
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,720
plan

276
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,200
we will be uh touching on here and then

277
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,920
we'll be giving up live examples or or

278
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,440
or uh what we have done uh uh let's say

279
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
uh in mauritius as well as in different

280
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
countries how they have been able to

281
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,640
let's say

282
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,800
test and implement and maintain their

283
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,279
plans so different countries they they

284
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,680
talk and they have uh

285
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,839
the national cyber crisis management

286
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,480
plan in with different names you know so

287
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,200
uh

288
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,320
some of them they are calling it

289
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,680
differently some of them they call

290
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,399
national cyber incidence response plan

291
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,240
uh some of them they call national cyber

292
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
crisis management plan some of them they

293
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,200
call it as national let's say a disaster

294
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,040
uh

295
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,440
cyber disaster uh let's say recruiting

296
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,000
plans so different things um and

297
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,399
different names so uh meaning is same

298
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,880
but it's just that how we put together

299
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,360
and that's what counts and that's what

300
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,399
we will be talking in this particular

301
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,240
uh training program

302
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
okay

303
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,839
so that that's the part of the

304
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,600
introduction so uh

305
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,920
now what i'll do is that because

306
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,800
me and

307
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,519
my colleague janitor uh we are together

308
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,519
so we will be discussing and opening the

309
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,560
floor uh let's say uh time to time uh so

310
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
to start with introduction to national

311
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,680
cyber uh crisis management plan um uh

312
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,160
i'll pass uh let's say the floor to to

313
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,639
likely and then uh again i'll come back

314
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,959
to you and then maybe we can uh discuss

315
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,880
more so uh

316
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,680
maybe uh janitor uh please uh take the

317
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,880
floor and then uh you uh start with uh

318
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,920
discussing the introduction and then i

319
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,839
take over the part of the

320
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,200
let's say

321
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,399
designing the plan thank you

322
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,240
will be sharing your screen

323
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,680
i can navigate

324
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
through good morning everyone

325
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,279
good afternoon

326
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,079
and welcome to this training session

327
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,600
and as kalim uh has already mentioned

328
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,279
like um

329
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,839
we are we are here today to talk about

330
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,920
the national cyber crisis management

331
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,880
plan

332
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,320
and this is a very important plan for

333
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,040
any country or at the level or at the

334
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,639
national level

335
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,079
and before going through uh

336
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,440
let us uh

337
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,240
it's very important that we know um when

338
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,120
we are talking about uh national cyber

339
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,320
uh crisis management so it's very

340
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,360
important that we know what is a cyber

341
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,320
incident so of course when we will be

342
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,240
developing our

343
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,839
national cyber crisis management plan so

344
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,240
of course we'll be addressing uh some of

345
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,199
the

346
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,160
incidents um that have a national

347
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,600
significance

348
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,800
okay that that impacts the the country

349
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,240
or or that have an impact on

350
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,920
at the national level

351
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,600
so uh i'm sure like many of you might

352
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,160
know what is a cyber incident

353
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,519
and just for the sake of of like

354
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,560
repeating it so it is a violation or

355
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,440
imminent threat of violation of computer

356
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,320
security policies acceptable use

357
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,079
policies or standard security practices

358
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:48,959
so

359
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,839
of course this is a definition but it is

360
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,600
not limited to that

361
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,199
okay and

362
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,160
of course it is it like it is an event

363
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,880
that will threaten

364
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,360
that will threaten uh the

365
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,959
uh the security

366
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
it will it it is an event that will

367
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,320
threaten the confidentiality integrity

368
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,519
or availability of information systems

369
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,480
or institutional data okay

370
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,199
so um

371
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,160
any incident it it won't like it it will

372
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,000
not like uh limit to like

373
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,639
whether it is like an attempt to gain

374
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,920
unauthorized access to a system or data

375
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,959
or for example they may there might be

376
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,759
like any like disruption or denial of

377
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,360
service or

378
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,240
it can be like any type of incident but

379
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,759
which of course it will impact on the

380
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,800
confidentiality integrity or

381
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,759
availability of any information systems

382
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,399
which is the core of the of information

383
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,680
security

384
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,560
so

385
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,479
can you move next slide calling

386
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,399
so what is a significant cyber incident

387
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,399
or cyber crisis

388
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,880
when we have to like to

389
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,839
develop a national cyber crisis incident

390
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,519
uh cyber crisis management plan so when

391
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,040
there there is a cyber incident which

392
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,720
impacts on the country or which has like

393
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,560
uh which result in a demonstrable harm

394
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,120
to the national security interests

395
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,839
foreign relations or economy of the

396
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,800
country or to the public confidence

397
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,759
public health and safety of the citizens

398
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,600
of the country so

399
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,480
this is a significant cyber incident or

400
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,120
cyber crisis it is when it is it has

401
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,839
some impact on the public health and

402
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,160
safety or even on the economy of the

403
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,839
country then there is we we can say that

404
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,720
it is a significant cyber incident or

405
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,519
cyber crisis which we need to address

406
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,480
accordingly so that we are able to cope

407
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,599
with it

408
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,959
and it can have like less um

409
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,079
we can limit the the damages it can

410
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,400
cause to to the country or to the

411
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,760
economy

412
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,839
next

413
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,159
slide so

414
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,000
that's why that we have to like when

415
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,679
there is any like us a cyber incident of

416
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,520
national significance

417
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,760
we need like something we we need to

418
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,160
have a plan so that we can go

419
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,200
accordingly so that we can uh be in a

420
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,080
better position to address it and to

421
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,280
handle it properly so that we can limit

422
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,080
whatever damages it can cause to to the

423
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,960
economy of the country so why is that

424
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,760
that need for incident response

425
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,600
today if we we see uh in this uh today's

426
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,400
uh

427
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,960
cyber uh threat landscape

428
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,840
so

429
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,000
the cyber threat landscape has changed

430
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,080
drastically uh

431
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,799
like for the past few years and why is

432
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,200
it because there is an increasing

433
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,559
reliance on technologies that offer many

434
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,520
advantages which have improved our

435
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,000
economy and quality of life

436
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,440
but at the same time it is also like it

437
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,960
makes us also vulnerable because it

438
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,320
these

439
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,080
technologies it can uh it can be used to

440
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,360
attack our digital infrastructure

441
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,640
which can uh impact on our national

442
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,760
security on our economic prosperity and

443
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,600
public safety so why that's why there is

444
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,039
a need for proper incident response

445
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,360
so that we can like uh

446
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,160
address the threat and then limit the

447
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,440
damages it can cause to our public

448
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,200
health or safety of our country

449
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,760
next slide

450
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,240
so the dependence

451
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,080
on well-functioning critical

452
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,880
infrastructures um what is a critical

453
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,000
infrastructure of course um many of you

454
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,679
they might know what is a critical

455
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,200
infrastructure but uh for those who like

456
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,600
who who doesn't know what is a critical

457
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,520
infrastructure it is uh simply like uh

458
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,039
those infrastructures which like uh they

459
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,160
run essential services and if there is

460
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,360
any impact on these infrastructure so it

461
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,559
this can uh it can have an impact on on

462
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,480
the public safety or

463
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,200
the economy of the country so these

464
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,440
critical infrastructures we have for

465
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
example like uh

466
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,200
utility or

467
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,240
health

468
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,600
we have uh like telecommunications so

469
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,480
these are like critical infrastructures

470
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,799
which run essential services in a

471
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,320
country so the dependence on the well

472
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,080
functioning of those critical

473
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,880
infrastructures so they point both at

474
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,000
the opportunities and vulnerabilities

475
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,919
related to the growing use of

476
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,159
information and communication

477
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,039
technologies so

478
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,840
they run important services

479
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,240
and but at the same time they are also

480
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,720
vulnerable uh

481
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
they are also vulnerable given that

482
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,919
there is that growing use of information

483
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,640
and communication technologies

484
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,760
now

485
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,360
many countries they have to ensure that

486
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,480
these critical infrastructures they are

487
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,000
well protected

488
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,640
they are well protected so that they can

489
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,240
deliver their services properly and

490
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,440
also

491
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,080
these services have to be available at

492
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,039
all time so that there is it does not

493
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,440
have any impact on the

494
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,080
economy of the country or on the public

495
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,960
health and safety so that is why we need

496
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,480
to have something

497
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,679
like a

498
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,200
concrete so like a plan so that if in

499
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,480
case there is any uh cyber attack on

500
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,600
those critical infrastructures we we can

501
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,159
have like a plan to follow where

502
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,039
everything is in place and then we have

503
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,000
all the uh setup is is here so that we

504
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,440
can address the threat uh accordingly

505
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,840
and then we can take all the necessary

506
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,880
measures

507
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,320
it is just like uh we uh like us when

508
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,039
that when whenever there is a cyclone so

509
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,840
there is a plan which is in place so

510
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,480
that the country can implement those

511
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,919
measures so that uh the the country and

512
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,679
and the uh public safety is is um like

513
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,640
and the country is uh is he's able to

514
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,200
cope with that and also uh

515
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,799
uh the public is safe and and the uh the

516
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,919
also the cyclone goes by uh smoothly so

517
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,640
it is really similar uh like that when

518
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,360
there is a cyber attack we need to have

519
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,080
a a crisis management plan so that we

520
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,039
can uh like treat it we can

521
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,840
handle it properly and limit the damages

522
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,639
it can cause

523
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,120
so um

524
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,000
next slide kalim

525
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,320
so the national capabilities for

526
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,480
incident response so national

527
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,280
capabilities or readiness this is very

528
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,799
important because

529
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,480
it it establishes how a country will

530
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,520
prevent will protect against those

531
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,880
threats will mitigate will respond to

532
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,000
and we and will recover from those uh

533
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
cyber threats so

534
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,880
that like at the country as uh they

535
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,120
should be able to to have those

536
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,760
capabilities they should be able to cope

537
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,520
with those

538
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,679
to cope whenever there is like a

539
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,240
significant cyber incident uh the

540
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,640
country should be able to have

541
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,120
all the necessary uh like

542
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,000
uh

543
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,559
not equipment as such but

544
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,440
it should be in a better position to

545
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,200
address those uh this type of incident

546
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,360
accordingly and

547
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,400
some of the uh national capabilities

548
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,440
which will uh help the country uh for

549
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,559
example it should be in a in a position

550
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,080
to have like legal and regulatory

551
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,760
measures in place

552
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,799
for example uh national laws affecting

553
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,200
cyber security or international

554
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,640
obligations for example if for uh

555
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,600
there is a need to uh to to seek the

556
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,919
help of international um counterparts so

557
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,679
there is uh to have like an agreement or

558
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,760
like uh s um

559
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,559
mousse and all so that they can be they

560
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,360
can

561
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,559
like help they can help other country to

562
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,360
to

563
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,279
address the threat

564
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,159
and

565
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,720
for example in terms of organizational

566
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,600
measures the country should be able to

567
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,400
have

568
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,720
organizational measures such as a

569
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,360
national cyber incident response plan or

570
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,240
national cyber crisis management plan it

571
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,799
should be it should have like a national

572
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,000
search for the coordination of cyber

573
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,240
security activities at the national

574
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,679
level

575
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,240
in terms of technical measures the

576
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,960
country should have like forensic

577
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,400
capabilities

578
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,159
it should have like

579
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,360
incident response tools for example to

580
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,880
to be able to uh to analyze the threats

581
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,520
to be able to to see where it is coming

582
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,919
so these types of of measures the

583
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,360
country should be able to have a lab or

584
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,679
uh these kind of tools

585
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,520
critical inform information

586
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,760
infrastructure protection this is what

587
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,240
we've been uh talking before like it

588
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,480
should be able to to be in a better

589
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,200
position to protect its critical

590
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,840
information infrastructures

591
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,400
now financial considerations

592
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,840
for example

593
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,480
the country should be able to to have

594
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,080
adequate budget uh for cyber security uh

595
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,720
this is also very important because uh

596
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,799
to implement cyber security measures in

597
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,240
the country it should be able to finance

598
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,320
those uh uh

599
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,320
should be able to have adequate budget

600
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,400
to finance those initiatives

601
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,880
in terms of implementation measures so

602
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,080
what we are talking about is that

603
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,360
responsibilities and coordination like

604
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,799
human resources or finance and and

605
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,320
should be able to have like uh uh

606
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,679
adequate human resource in place so that

607
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,400
if there is any cyber threat they can be

608
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,880
able to to deal with it

609
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,360
awareness raising measures and education

610
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,840
this is also important because

611
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,320
the population the public in general

612
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,200
should be able to to have adequate

613
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,640
knowledge that

614
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,520
we should like uh create an information

615
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,240
security culture and and educate the

616
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,880
population at large so that they know at

617
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,200
least what are the threats and how they

618
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,640
can protect themselves

619
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,760
okay

620
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,039
so in order to be prepared for a cyber

621
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,200
security incident of national

622
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,559
significance

623
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,640
so it is very important like to

624
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,039
understand the level of threat to the

625
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,240
nation and and this can be done in like

626
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,279
uh in different ways of course so i'm

627
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,559
sure um you you you might be knowing

628
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,120
like uh in order to to

629
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,480
to know what is the to assess the cyber

630
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,679
threat

631
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,320
landscape or to assess the cyber threat

632
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,919
level to any country so we can do it by

633
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:02,880
either

634
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,600
um like um

635
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,919
uh assessing the national cyber security

636
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,840
landscape so uh we have to to analyze uh

637
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,240
the country's cyber security strength

638
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,880
and weaknesses so what what are the

639
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,360
countries strength and and where it is

640
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,640
lacking in terms of measures in terms of

641
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,159
of resources so uh this is this can be

642
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,760
done in that way

643
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,559
and also like um

644
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,960
some of the important elements to be

645
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,080
considered when we are assessing the

646
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,440
national cyber security uh landscape

647
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,440
is for example

648
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,039
what types what different types of cyber

649
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,840
security threats that the country is

650
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,440
concerned because

651
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,679
not every country is uh like uh

652
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,960
they they are like uh they have

653
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,520
the different threat uh cyber threat

654
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,760
level is not like the same for every

655
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,000
country for example if

656
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,600
if in one country you have like uh let's

657
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,120
say run somewhere is like very common so

658
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,360
for another country it mean it may not

659
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,919
it might not be the case so there are

660
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,760
different types of cyber security

661
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,399
threats that each and every particular

662
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,640
country is concerned with

663
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,080
so uh the sources of these threats for

664
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,440
example whether it is like the country

665
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,880
faces uh organized crimes or

666
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,159
state-sponsored organizations or there

667
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,559
are like extremist groups like these

668
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,799
types of threats whether the country

669
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,600
is facing or not okay

670
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,960
or any like vulnerabilities that may

671
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,480
attack critical infrastructure so uh

672
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,520
these all like we we need to to to

673
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,080
assess all these elements all these

674
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,640
features so that we can be in a better

675
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,679
position to to know where the country is

676
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,640
at the level of the cybersec other at

677
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,080
the cyber security uh like uh to assess

678
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,240
the cyber security landscape so it's

679
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,240
very important that we know where the

680
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,720
country stands in terms of its cyber

681
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,760
threats and and and that is

682
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,440
where it will allow us to to to um to

683
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,159
take the measures to to have initiatives

684
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,360
so that we can improve that and and and

685
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,320
develop in our cyber crisis management

686
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,639
plan

687
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,279
so um

688
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,440
we've been talking since the beginning

689
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,279
about the national cyber crisis

690
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,080
management plan so

691
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,240
in fact what it is about so we've been

692
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,360
able we've been discussing uh so far

693
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,799
about that so why we need uh to have a

694
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,600
national cyber crisis management plan

695
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,679
and let me tell you that

696
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,720
national cyber crisis management plan

697
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,600
is

698
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,120
this is the name for that plan but uh

699
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,760
in many countries uh we have uh like

700
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,279
different names for that types of plan

701
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,840
in in some of the countries it is called

702
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,200
as the national cyber incident response

703
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,520
plan so some

704
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,399
there are certain countries which uh

705
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,039
refer it a cyber crisis management plan

706
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,120
but uh

707
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,399
it is like

708
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,159
this is a plan which is which deals with

709
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,240
addressing like a cyber incident of uh

710
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,600
national significance so the aim is the

711
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,480
same but the name can be different so

712
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,679
in general so what it is an

713
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:47,120
organizational measure it is an

714
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,559
organizational measure and and it is uh

715
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,720
like a plan which

716
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,760
which elaborates on the actions on the

717
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,760
responsibilities like uh to have a

718
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,559
coordinated and

719
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,679
multi-disciplinary approach

720
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,919
to respond to and to recover from a

721
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,399
cyber security incident of national

722
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,679
significance which can impact on the

723
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,000
critical systems of any country so

724
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,120
through that plan we we have the roles

725
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,000
we have the responsibilities of the

726
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,720
different bodies that will allow that

727
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,240
will help the country to respond and to

728
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,519
recover from any type of significant

729
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,000
cyber incident when it occurs so this is

730
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,440
that's it so

731
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,279
it is just a plan to to uh to

732
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,480
allow the country to to handle that

733
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,559
crisis and to if i like to handle it

734
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,200
properly and then to recover it in an

735
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,519
effective way

736
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,840
next

737
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,519
so why we need to uh to develop that

738
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,159
cyber national cyber crisis management

739
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,720
plan so uh

740
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,919
of course it is very important to to

741
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,480
to to have that plan uh

742
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,120
at the national level but the rationale

743
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,399
for develop developing that plan is to

744
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,360
to have like the roles and

745
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,039
responsibilities of the stakeholders

746
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,679
well established uh during a crisis

747
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,679
situation because if not then uh if in

748
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,240
case there is any crisis so we don't

749
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,840
know uh uh what organization or which

750
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,880
stakeholder will will uh look uh will

751
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,480
will be uh looking after uh which like

752
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,559
aspect so

753
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,000
in order to to avoid that confusion that

754
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,320
uh that cause so

755
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,720
it's very important that we have a plan

756
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,679
which already defines like a which

757
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,720
stakeholder will do what in in time in a

758
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,200
time of crisis so then

759
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,760
at that particular time that we we

760
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,760
already have that plan in place when we

761
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,480
can just implement the plan with in

762
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,679
order to reduce the limit which uh that

763
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,120
damage that incident can cause okay so

764
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,519
it is the plan um

765
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,000
the the rationale for developing it is

766
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,440
to we have already the rules and

767
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,440
responsibilities of the stakeholders

768
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,039
well established

769
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,640
okay and also to devise the ways for

770
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,480
incident resolution

771
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,679
okay to to already have like uh

772
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:36,720
so that

773
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,399
we already have in place uh the the way

774
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,600
for uh uh the way forward uh to to

775
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,600
resolve an incident

776
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,519
okay and and it will also like uh this

777
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,320
plan will also be used to ensure that

778
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,960
information is properly shared

779
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,200
between the stakeholders

780
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
it is very important that the proper

781
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,559
information is passed uh

782
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,960
to the stakeholders at in a moment of

783
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,000
crisis the right information accurate

784
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,918
information is posted to the

785
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,800
stakeholders and in the plan we this

786
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,359
will allow that proper information

787
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,399
sharing to take place

788
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,159
and it will also like up it will also

789
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,679
like uh serve as a basis to improve and

790
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,879
coordinate any cyber incident at the at

791
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,879
the institutional level

792
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,159
and also uh to set up the communication

793
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,960
channel for message passing related to

794
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,359
that incident for example in case we

795
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,599
need to communicate that incident to the

796
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,159
press or we need to communicate that

797
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,520
incident to international counterpart so

798
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,239
what are the ways what are the methods

799
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,280
that we have to use uh to go through in

800
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,960
order to have that uh message passed so

801
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,440
it's very important that we define all

802
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,200
these procedures in the national cyber

803
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,640
crisis management plan

804
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:11,839
so as i i was telling you uh before

805
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:12,800
uh

806
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,040
different countries they have

807
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,079
their national cyber crisis management

808
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,320
plan and and it is uh uh

809
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,880
of course they they can have different

810
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,640
name for for that and for example uh in

811
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,680
mauritius we we have we we call it as

812
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,920
the national cyber incident response

813
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,800
plan

814
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,000
even if you look at the u.s so it is

815
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,560
called as national cyber incident

816
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,920
response plan

817
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,359
and

818
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,560
for canada it is like another name and

819
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,560
even for other countries such as

820
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,680
australia we call it as a cyber incident

821
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,240
management arrangement so

822
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,839
basically it it is the same plan but

823
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,320
with different name so some of the

824
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,280
countries which have been able to set up

825
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,480
this plan at the national level

826
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,400
are like mauritius us australia uk

827
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,680
canada and of course there are

828
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,920
many others

829
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,480
which have been able to to to to set up

830
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,040
this plan

831
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,280
so the objectives of of this plan is

832
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,079
uh

833
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,359
of course to to minimize the disruption

834
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,839
of services or loss of information

835
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,520
caused by incidents

836
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,720
and this is very important that

837
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,079
in case there is any uh cyber incident

838
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,480
of national significance so the

839
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,680
operations should continue so we should

840
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,839
not be in a position to stop other

841
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:56,160
activities at the national level and

842
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,560
that's why it is very important that we

843
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,040
have a cyber crisis management plan that

844
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,599
will allow the country to

845
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,800
uh to

846
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,880
keep on

847
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,560
its operation despite there is a a

848
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,640
national cyber incident

849
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,359
uh of of of like

850
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,359
a cyber incident of national

851
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,040
significance

852
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,800
and also uh

853
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,119
like we were discussing before like to

854
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,880
elaborate on the actions and

855
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,480
responsibilities

856
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,760
of different stakeholders like what uh

857
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,800
which stakeholders uh we will do what in

858
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,440
that time of crisis so it's very

859
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,280
important that to

860
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,800
we elaborate those uh roles and

861
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,480
responsibilities in that plan

862
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,720
and of course to use the information

863
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,200
gained for better preparation or for

864
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,800
future handling of incident so this um

865
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,320
the plan will also allow uh the country

866
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,000
to to have their lessons learned so

867
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,640
if there is an incident so we learn

868
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,880
by that incident and then we can take

869
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,079
the measures so that this incident does

870
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,520
not repeat

871
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,560
and and we don't face as such situations

872
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,960
again

873
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,160
now uh applicability of a national cyber

874
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,240
crisis management plan

875
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,760
so uh how this uh plan as a whole will

876
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,119
be uh will

877
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,839
how how it will be applicable to the

878
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,720
country so uh

879
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,760
as we were discussing like it uh any

880
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,119
cyber uh

881
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,680
crisis management plan or any national

882
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,079
cyber incident response plan it will

883
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,880
depend on country to country and it can

884
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,680
take any form so it will depend on the

885
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,000
country's objective it will depend on

886
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,320
the country's preparedness it will

887
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,200
depend on many other factors

888
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,920
and uh of course on the objectives and

889
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,640
level of preparedness or cyber readiness

890
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,480
so it it it will depend on that so

891
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,119
it it will what it will do is that it

892
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,119
will uh

893
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,359
this plan will be applicable to the

894
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,720
public and private sector of any country

895
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,680
so it is not limited to public sector

896
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,480
but as well as the private sector

897
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,839
can also

898
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,520
use uh this plan and they can also uh

899
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,560
use this plan as a basis and they can

900
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,599
devise their own uh plan at the at the

901
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,520
organizational level

902
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,720
but the applicability of this plan is

903
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,359
is uh

904
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,359
that it will it

905
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,280
it it it is an approach that will will

906
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,800
uh will

907
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,440
mitigate and respond it will help to

908
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,320
mitigate it will help to respond and it

909
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,839
will help to recover from a a cyber

910
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,880
incident of national significance so

911
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,079
this is very important and also what it

912
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,200
will do is that it

913
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,599
it is a connection between the public

914
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,400
and the private sector to address major

915
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,520
cyber security risk so through this plan

916
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,079
the private and the public sector they

917
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,640
work together they collaborate together

918
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,079
so that they can

919
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,920
be able to to help the country to

920
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,400
overcome that incident and to take

921
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,839
those measures in due time so that it is

922
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,079
it does not impact the operations of a

923
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,560
country

924
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,880
so

925
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,280
how many of you have have have come

926
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,200
across a national cyber crisis

927
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,720
management plan

928
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,680
is there any like

929
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,000
some of you have have been able to go

930
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,839
through a national crisis management

931
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,839
plan

932
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,119
like do you have a cyber crisis

933
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,640
management plan uh at at the level of

934
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,799
the country

935
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,440

any questions

939

have you gone through a national cyber

940
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,640
crisis management plan or any

941
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,879
national cyber incident response plan

942
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,160
no

943
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,240

we have mustafa

948
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,800
he's saying

949
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
they don't have any cyber crisis

950
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,440
management plan from

951
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,480
his country okay

952
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,000
messi mustafa uh

953
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:18,319
okay okay

954
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:21,830
so

955
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,240
[Music]

956
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,359
all right

957
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,960
um so what

958
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,200
in a national cyber crisis management

959
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,960
plan so

960
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,960
we need to have certain elements in

961
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,079
place and uh there we there is to have

962
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,440
like uh

963
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,160
uh we need to to focus on certain

964
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,520
elements so that it becomes like a very

965
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,240
coordinated approach to respond to the

966
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,680
to the incident so it should be a formal

967
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,800
focused and coordinated approach to

968
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,520
respond to incidents that provides a

969
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,400
roadmap for implementing the incident

970
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,599
response capability so what it does is

971
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,800
is that it it is like a formal document

972
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,680
that we need to develop and then we need

973
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,839
to that will also um it will it will uh

974
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:16,079
like uh act as a roadmap for the country

975
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,040
so that they can uh they can follow that

976
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,079
plan whenever there is uh any cyber

977
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,920
crisis uh

978
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,720
in the country so what are the some

979
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,599
elements of the plan that we should have

980
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,079
like uh what are the main elements of

981
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,119
the plan

982
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,880
that we need to

983
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,880
to to know about is that we need to have

984
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,760
like

985
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,480
any any other plan we need to have a

986
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,800
vision and mission statement

987
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,680
um

988
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,920
like what are our vision and what are

989
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,560
our mission through this plan

990
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,720
we need to have our purpose and

991
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,440
objectives of this plan so what

992
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,119
objectives like this plan will achieve

993
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,079
the scope of the policy that is uh to

994
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,880
whom and what it applies and under what

995
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,200
circumstances

996
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,760
definition of cyber incident and related

997
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,480
terms because it's very important that

998
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,920
we the cyber incident is defined and

999
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,560
this also it depends on the country to

1000
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,839
country so

1001
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,680
what um

1002
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,079
cyber incident of of national

1003
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,520
significant

1004
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,520
uh it may

1005
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,680
be different for from countries to

1006
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,800
countries

1007
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,079
what uh if an incident is critical for

1008
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,560
one country it may not be critical for

1009
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,200
another country so this depends on

1010
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,040
countries to countries

1011
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,079
okay

1012
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,160
the roles and responsibilities of

1013
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,560
stakeholders so it's very important that

1014
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,839
in the plan

1015
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,560
we we should be able to

1016
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,160
to uh to identify to elaborate on the

1017
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,720
roles of of of stakeholders on their

1018
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,720
responsibilities

1019
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,839
also we need also to prioritize uh

1020
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:06,000
or uh like address the severity ratings

1021
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,480
of incidents it's very important that we

1022
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,720
know which incident or which type of

1023
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,680
incident

1024
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,560
we categorize as high or which which

1025
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,359
type of incident uh will be categorized

1026
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,119
as medium or lo and and uh which

1027
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,400
incident will be uh uh which will be

1028
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,680
addressed and and uh first uh so that

1029
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,040
it's very important that we we

1030
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,800
prioritize those types of incidents

1031
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,880
information sharing and communication

1032
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,760
methods so there is it's very important

1033
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,720
that we also know when we have to share

1034
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,880
information so what are the channels we

1035
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,200
need we need to use and who will be

1036
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,839
sharing those information so it's very

1037
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,560
important to address that also

1038
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,720
metrics for measuring the incident

1039
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,480
response capability and its

1040
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,520
effectiveness so how we measure our

1041
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,720
incident response capability and

1042
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,440
this is also very important to to

1043
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,119
address in the plan

1044
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:05,920
so

1045
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,640
these are like some of the main elements

1046
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,640
we need to to have in the plan

1047
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,400
so if we go like very quickly uh so what

1048
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,000
we mean by vision and mission so

1049
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,520
uh in

1050
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,560
uh in any plan or in even in the

1051
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,920
national cyber crisis management plan so

1052
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,520
to to to make it successful we need to

1053
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,960
have a vision

1054
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,319
uh so that all stakeholders associated

1055
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:41,200
with that plan they understand they know

1056
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,000
what

1057
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,280
this plan is all about and how it can be

1058
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,640
uh how it can be accomplished and and

1059
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,920
also uh the plan will impact whom

1060
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,400
so it's very important that it is

1061
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,560
already clear at the beginning

1062
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,760
uh so that uh all the stakeholders all

1063
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,839
the relevant person connected to the

1064
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:05,359
plan they know what it is about and what

1065
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,760
what it will do and

1066
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,800
when it will be applicable uh

1067
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,720
so amongst others

1068
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,680
so the clearer the vision the easier it

1069
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,640
will be for leaders and key stakeholders

1070
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,640
to ensure that

1071
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,920
any incident is is addressed in a

1072
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,119
consistent and coherent approach so it's

1073
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,200
very important that we

1074
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,839
at the beginning itself we have a clear

1075
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,760
mission a clear vision

1076
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,400
and also to have a clear

1077
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,880
mission because this mission will uh

1078
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,000
will uh determine the purpose and the

1079
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,640
objectives of the plan so that's why

1080
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,079
it's very important that at the

1081
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,119
beginning itself we have a clear vision

1082
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,240
and mission statement

1083
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,000
now

1084
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,040
purpose and objectives so of course like

1085
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,440
any other plan we need to have a purpose

1086
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,680
and objective of the plan and this

1087
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,559
should be clearly stated so

1088
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,480
as you can see on the screen so

1089
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,599
different countries they have their own

1090
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,240
different purpose and objectives so it

1091
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,400
depends on country to country the

1092
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,079
purpose of one country and the

1093
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,319
objectives it may not be the same for

1094
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:25,359
every country for example if you look at

1095
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:30,960
this so we have like uh usa have one uh

1096
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,480
different uh objectives and canada for

1097
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,640
canada we have other uh different

1098
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,319
objectives so this is uh it

1099
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,079
for example uh

1100
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:44,960
if we look at here like the object one

1101
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,640
of the objective of the cyber canada

1102
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,839
cyber security event management plan is

1103
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:52,800
to

1104
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,000
improve cyber event coordination and

1105
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,839
management uh also to mitigate threats

1106
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,000
and vulnerabilities before a compromise

1107
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,920
can occur okay so this is uh different

1108
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,520
and uh

1109
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,599
whereas for u.s

1110
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,599
they say that it

1111
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,760
the purpose of this plan is to

1112
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,400
illustrate a national commitment to

1113
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,880
strengthening their security and

1114
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,160
resilience of network technologies of

1115
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,280
infrastructure so this is like the

1116
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,880
difference between countries to

1117
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,880
countries so

1118
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,920
the purpose and objectives might differ

1119
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,359
okay

1120
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,680
next

1121
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,359
but the scope for the national cyber

1122
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,800
crisis management plan this is also uh

1123
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,480
it can differ from countries to

1124
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,240
countries but you can refer to uh to

1125
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,240
existing national cyber crisis

1126
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,800
management plan to see how they have

1127
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,920
defined their scope okay so the scope

1128
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,040
for one country it may not be the same

1129
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,280
for other countries for example

1130
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,079
like the scope of a national cyber

1131
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:09,119
crisis management plan is to

1132
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,400
provide a consolidated approach

1133
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,880
national approach to the management and

1134
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,319
coordination of potential cyber threats

1135
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:21,839
or incident so it sets out the roles and

1136
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:25,040
responsibilities of all stakeholders

1137
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,319
critical sectors and other public and

1138
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,359
private sector in managing incidents of

1139
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,000
critical in nature so

1140
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,119
it the scope is like it it will

1141
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,880
eventually uh create it will eventually

1142
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,200
provide that national approach for

1143
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,319
addressing

1144
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,760
any incident of national significance

1145
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,720
okay

1146
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,118
next

1147
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:53,119
so

1148
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,079
the need to define a cyber incident so

1149
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:59,200
uh this is i've already mentioned like

1150
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,000
uh it should be clear why we need to

1151
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,640
define a cyber incident because

1152
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,599
it also this also depends on the country

1153
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,079
to country because if

1154
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,000
and a cyber incident

1155
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,599
is like

1156
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:14,559
uh

1157
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,119
not all cyber incident will be of

1158
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,400
national significance okay as a cyber

1159
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,599
incident

1160
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,520
it it may

1161
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,079
like differ from country to country so

1162
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,119
in that is why it's very important in

1163
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,520
the when developing the national cyber

1164
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,599
crisis management plan

1165
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:34,839
we have that

1166
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:37,920
definition that term of incident it

1167
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,559
should be clear it should be clear and

1168
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:41,839
it should

1169
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:45,839
it should also help to uh to clarify the

1170
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:49,760
roles and and structures of the incident

1171
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,400
response team so it's very important

1172
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,359
that we define uh the cyber incident

1173
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:59,119
beforehand so that it can help to

1174
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,960
to clarify the roles and

1175
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,760
responsibilities of other stakeholders

1176
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,000
associated with that plan okay

1177
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,760
so um

1178
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,839
stakeholder management

1179
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,960
of course this is very important because

1180
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,839
in in any situation where there is a

1181
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:20,800
cyber crisis in the country so the

1182
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,160
collaboration of all stakeholders is

1183
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,520
crucial

1184
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,720
so that the country is able to uh

1185
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,680
to mitigate the threat and you know able

1186
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,960
to recover from the threat if uh like in

1187
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,319
uh in a systematic manner so it's very

1188
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,559
important that all stakeholders the

1189
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,960
joints hand together to address the

1190
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,400
threat so that the damage can be limited

1191
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,800
so that it does not impact the economy

1192
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,000
and public health and safety so that is

1193
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,880
why we have to address that

1194
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,800
we have to focus on stakeholder

1195
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,839
management

1196
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:01,760
uh we have to to know

1197
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,960
uh which stakeholders will be involved

1198
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:10,800
in that uh in that cyber crisis and uh

1199
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,920
that is why we need to to already like

1200
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,480
put it in in that plan and

1201
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,760
it will help to identify an initial

1202
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,359
stake a set of stakeholders so when we

1203
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:27,920
are at the stage of developing that plan

1204
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,520
itself we will be able to identify which

1205
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,000
stakeholders will do what

1206
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,839
okay so this is very important so

1207
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,800
examples of stakeholders which will be

1208
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,559
no which normally uh gets involved when

1209
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,599
there is any cyber crisis uh in the

1210
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:48,800
country

1211
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,520
they will include government bodies such

1212
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,280
as

1213
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,480
the police or the search or

1214
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,760
any other government agencies critical

1215
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,920
infrastructure operators

1216
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,880
uh

1217
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,119
it depends on the sector which is

1218
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,559
impacted and also private bodies

1219
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:11,359
such as we have the telcos we have uh

1220
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,240
any other private bodies that will help

1221
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,119
in

1222
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,760
in the uh result

1223
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,880
in the resolution of the incident

1224
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,160
and uh in the in the drafting of the

1225
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,760
plan uh

1226
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,400
we should bear in mind that the rules

1227
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,760
should be clarified and outlined how

1228
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,400
they will collaborate in order to manage

1229
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,920
expectations throughout the process in

1230
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,400
order to achieve success so it's very

1231
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,000
important that we clearly have the roles

1232
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,880
of the stakeholders uh which will be

1233
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,040
involved in the resolution of the

1234
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,400
incident properly defined so this will

1235
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,799
help in in the

1236
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:59,359
in the faster resolution of the incident

1237
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:04,559
so examples of stakeholders which are

1238
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,400
normally involved in a cyber crisis

1239
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,040
include law enforcement like the police

1240
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,000
we have private sectors such as uh

1241
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,799
critical sectors we have internet

1242
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:19,280
service providers we have telcos we have

1243
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,559
vendors

1244
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:21,839
and

1245
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,880
other stakeholders this is like

1246
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,480
insiders but we have other stakeholders

1247
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,920
which can be international counterparts

1248
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,200
such as foreign law enforcement agencies

1249
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,599
or international other international

1250
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:41,119
assets that will help in the resolution

1251
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,160
of the incident so if you look at the

1252
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,240
screen you can have an example which

1253
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:50,079
have been taken from the uh canada cyber

1254
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:53,359
security event management plan so that

1255
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:54,000
it

1256
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,680
it is clearly listed like the what are

1257
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,640
the stakeholders which will be involved

1258
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,720
which which play a key role in in

1259
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,000
if there is any uh cyber crisis uh at

1260
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,079
the level of the country so it is

1261
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,000
clearly mentioned who are the

1262
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,640
stakeholders which will form part of

1263
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,760
that

1264
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,160
of that of the resolution of that

1265
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,720
incident

1266
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,000
now uh if we talk about the governance

1267
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,040
so

1268
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,559
for any uh cyber crisis uh we need to

1269
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:34,160
have like a body which takes the

1270
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,520
decisions the timely decisions and and

1271
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,280
and when there is a cyber crisis uh at

1272
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,160
the level of the country so there is to

1273
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,760
have like a a body responsible to take

1274
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,559
timely decisions so that the ins so that

1275
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:54,000
the incident can be uh resolved faster

1276
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,280
and and and decisions can be taken so it

1277
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,599
is not that when that

1278
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:02,640
incident happens then they will decide

1279
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,119
who will take the decisions but then it

1280
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,079
it is

1281
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,720
it will take too much of time

1282
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,599
then the damage can be it can create

1283
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:14,960
lots of damage so if we already define

1284
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,200
like who will be the body taking

1285
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,160
decisions at that particular moment when

1286
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,359
there is a cyber crisis so this will

1287
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:26,960
help in uh taking timely decisions at

1288
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,480
the right time so during a cyber

1289
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,839
security event the timely engagement of

1290
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:36,799
appropriate level of governing bodies

1291
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:39,440
will focus on both management and

1292
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,359
operations to prevent detect and respond

1293
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:46,720
to and recover from any cyber security

1294
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,760
event in a prioritized manner so we

1295
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,599
already have that committee oh that

1296
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:55,839
body to take the decisions already set

1297
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:59,760
up in place beforehand and when there is

1298
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,559
any cyber crisis occurring so we know

1299
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,200
that this body will be taking the

1300
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,720
decisions and

1301
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,720
then there will be like a

1302
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,440
speedy decisions to be uh can be take it

1303
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,640
can be taken and then this will also uh

1304
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,599
help to to limit the damage that that

1305
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:22,079
incident can can uh can

1306
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,160
do okay so uh for example in many

1307
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,440
countries uh there are bodies uh there

1308
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,319
are committees that have been set up if

1309
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:35,280
you go through any national cyber crisis

1310
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,480
management plan or any national cyber

1311
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,720
incident response plan so you will see

1312
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,599
in the governance section so there are

1313
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:46,160
bodies which have been set up that will

1314
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:50,160
be responsible for taking up decisions

1315
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,160
at that particular

1316
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,280
crisis moment of crisis so examples of

1317
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,160
governance bodies include

1318
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,760
you can have the cyber security

1319
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,119
committee or executive management team

1320
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,680
national cyber security committee cyber

1321
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,720
security council cyber security advisory

1322
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,160
council or co event coordination team

1323
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,280
just to name a few so this is not limit

1324
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,240
limited so we have other names as well

1325
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,720
but the the purpose is the same their

1326
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,440
objectives are the same and

1327
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,400
is to take timely decisions uh during

1328
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,160
that moment of crisis

1329
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,960
so um

1330
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,400
we also uh need to have an incident

1331
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,119
response coordinating team uh which will

1332
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,119
be responsible for the incident

1333
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,880
resolution so this i think kalim will be

1334
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,839
elaborating much more in detail in the

1335
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:51,440
part too so uh on the incident response

1336
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,640
coordinating team so this is also very

1337
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,799
important that we have it

1338
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,760
uh

1339
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,440
already uh clearly mentioned in the plan

1340
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,640
so who will form part of the incident

1341
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:08,079
response coordinating team to uh to

1342
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:11,680
respond to that incident of of

1343
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,079
national significance and of course

1344
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:17,119
whoever forms part of the team will we

1345
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:19,839
should have specialized knowledge should

1346
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:23,520
have experience in various level of of

1347
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,400
uh cyber security in technical areas

1348
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,359
such as forensics or intrusion detection

1349
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,480
so that they can be able to carry out

1350
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,160
the incident response uh

1351
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,200
like uh

1352
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:41,280
incident resolution uh properly

1353
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,839
next

1354
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:49,599
so uh here also uh we have taken example

1355
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:52,559
of the canada uh security event

1356
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:55,200
management plan so as you can see in

1357
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,400
this on the screen so uh how the

1358
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,960
incident response coordinating team will

1359
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:01,680
be

1360
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,960
uh will be uh like who forms part of

1361
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,559
that and uh how they will be acting so

1362
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,640
there are different levels so this is

1363
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,200
also we'll be discussing in depth in the

1364
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,480
part two so what you need to know is

1365
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,119
that uh the incident uh response

1366
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:22,880
coordinating team can consist of of

1367
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,760
various members from different uh

1368
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,599
agencies such as

1369
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,280
law enforcement cert or isps or public

1370
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,319
safety or the forensic department so

1371
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:37,520
this team can be can consist members

1372
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:41,280
from different other uh uh different

1373
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,480
other agencies so that the team can have

1374
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,599
like a mix of of expertise and knowledge

1375
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,599
and and uh

1376
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,240
special specialties so that they can

1377
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,599
handle that incident properly

1378
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:56,480
and

1379
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,319
other stakeholders as well can be

1380
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,319
involved but this depends on the nature

1381
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:01,680
of the incident

1382
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,000
okay

1383
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:08,240
so uh this is again an example taken

1384
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,520
from the u.s so uh in the u.s the

1385
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,680
incident the response coordinating team

1386
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,160
is known as the cyber unified

1387
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:19,359
coordination group and of course um

1388
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:23,039
there are many um like uh stakeholders

1389
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,599
involved in that in that group which

1390
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:28,400
will be convened whenever there is any

1391
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,799
cyber crisis

1392
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,200
so uh determining the incident severity

1393
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,359
level this is also very important to

1394
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,640
mention like uh how um

1395
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,760
uh like whenever there is a cyber crisis

1396
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,880
so what how the team will determine the

1397
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,839
incident severity level and based on

1398
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:53,680
that uh

1399
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,920
incident severity level

1400
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,039
what type of decisions will be taken so

1401
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:02,799
uh this is very important to to to

1402
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:05,760
determine to to already have it in the

1403
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,720
plan how the incident severity level

1404
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:13,119
will be determined and on which factors

1405
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:15,839
and on which factors and and and how

1406
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:18,720
they will how the team will be able to

1407
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:22,240
know whether it is an incident of high

1408
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,000
severity or

1409
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,960
medium severity or low severity so it's

1410
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,280
very important that it is mentioned in

1411
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:33,599
the plan how the incident response team

1412
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:36,400
will be able to determine the severity

1413
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,799
level

1414
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,680
so this is another example taken from

1415
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,720
the us so this is also we'll be uh

1416
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:50,160
discussing in depth on the part two so

1417
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,079
how to determine the incident severity

1418
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:54,559
level so i think kalim will be

1419
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:56,720
elaborating more on that

1420
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:00,079
in the part too so i just uh this we can

1421
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:02,400
skip it and then you will have it in the

1422
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,520
part two

1423
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,480
of of this training session

1424
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,440
so next slide

1425
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,839
information sharing and communication

1426
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:14,480
methods so

1427
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,039
as i have been telling you it's very

1428
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:20,319
important that we already have it clear

1429
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:22,799
like what will be our communication

1430
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:25,280
methods how we will be able to share

1431
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,599
information whenever there is a cyber

1432
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:28,720
crisis

1433
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,520
and

1434
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,599
who will be sharing that information

1435
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,920
what protocol we will be using to share

1436
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,720
information for example

1437
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,400
in many countries

1438
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,480
we have uh like the traffic light

1439
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,599
protocol which is being used to share

1440
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:49,200
information and and this is created in

1441
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,319
order to facilitate greater information

1442
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:56,640
sharing so and also we use the tlp so

1443
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,119
that we ensure that sensitive

1444
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:01,760
information is shared with the

1445
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,880
appropriate audience so as you you may

1446
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,079
know that

1447
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:10,319
any cyber incident is uh there are many

1448
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:14,160
sensitive details uh there are many uh

1449
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,440
uh it is it involves like uh

1450
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,160
confidential information at times so

1451
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,440
which we won't uh have to share with

1452
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,720
others so how will be able to know which

1453
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:29,280
information to share with which audience

1454
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:32,720
so this we can be uh

1455
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,839
we can use the tlp for doing that and

1456
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:37,599
that is why in

1457
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,520
when developing the national cyber

1458
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:42,000
crisis management plan it is very

1459
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,720
important to have all these

1460
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,119
communication methods and information

1461
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,039
sharing methodologies already uh

1462
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,079
put up already put up in the plan so

1463
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:57,599
that it can allow uh

1464
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:00,400
like a quicker incident

1465
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,760
information to be passed to relevant uh

1466
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,319
parties

1467
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:10,400
next slide so uh some of the um

1468
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,839
like uh parties for sharing uh

1469
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:17,359
information involve uh we can have like

1470
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:20,079
other incident response team like

1471
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:22,720
uh international counterparts we can

1472
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,319
have internet service providers or even

1473
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:28,799
uh software vendors like we can share

1474
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:31,440
information with software vendors or law

1475
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,400
enforcement agencies such as the police

1476
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,799
so these are some of the

1477
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:39,280
parties which we may share information

1478
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,079
whenever there is a cyber crisis

1479
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:46,359
at the level of the country

1480
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:52,160
so um this is the end of the part

1481
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,760
one so

1482
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,119
um the part one is uh just to give you

1483
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:00,720
an introductory uh about the

1484
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,960
what the national cyber crisis

1485
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,599
management plan is all about and what

1486
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,160
are the main elements that we should be

1487
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:12,160
including in the plan so uh the part b

1488
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:14,799
of this training session uh which will

1489
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:16,000
be uh

1490
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,119
uh delivered by kalim will will be like

1491
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:22,559
more in depth on the what's inside the

1492
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:23,839
plan and

1493
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:27,440
what will be uh how you can um

1494
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,079
what what are the main uh like

1495
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,920
how you should go

1496
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,359
about with the plan and and this will uh

1497
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:38,720
gives you an a more in uh inside uh

1498
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,960
knowledge about the

1499
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,799
about developing the national cyber

1500
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:45,920
crisis management plan so then we can

1501
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,119
we'll have a break kalim

1502
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:55,200
yeah okay so uh if there is any question

1503

1521
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,359
what we do

1522
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:26,400

1523
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:33,600
i'll open it and just

1524
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,880

1525
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:38,399

1526
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:40,639
yeah

1527
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:42,960
so

1528
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:45,439
thank you

1529
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:48,879
i think we can we can

1530
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,679
i think you have to close your mic

1531
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:02,679
okay

1532
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,520
no it's good yeah

1533
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,800
so

1534
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,480
we we we can keep it interactive if

1535
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,560
you're having any questions we can uh we

1536
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,080
can take it up

1537
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,400
uh so feel free to ask anything whatever

1538
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,640
you have in mind so

1539
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,920
we can discuss uh much more so that

1540
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,239
we want to uh

1541
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:36,239
make the session in such a way that uh

1542
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,400
is much more uh

1543
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,320
in a way you understand things rather

1544
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,679
than uh

1545
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:44,320
we are talking and and exactly we're

1546
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,560
trying to uh let's see make understand

1547
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,880
as much as possible that how the whole

1548
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,760
plan is is applied but at the same time

1549
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,159
uh if you ask questions then i think

1550
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:56,480
we'll be in a better position to

1551
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,040
explain more outside the box what we're

1552
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,199
talking on the slides

1553
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:03,040
so looks like that there are no

1554
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,199
questions uh if in case there are no

1555
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:08,800
questions so uh is uh exactly

1556
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,760
um

1557
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,960
quarter past noon utc time and then we

1558
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,520
will take a short break of 10 minutes

1559
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,080
and we'll get back to you with the

1560
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,640
second part of the discussion on to

1561
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,560
uh the

1562
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,440
how to design and the the

1563
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:28,480
national cyber crisis management plan so

1564
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,840
but before uh closing janet dimension uh

1565
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,840
two three thing important things uh

1566
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,719
which we need to understand uh whenever

1567
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:39,520
uh let's say we are going for the plan

1568
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,800
implementation

1569
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,480
one important thing is that we need to

1570
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:45,040
have the the governance structure

1571
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:48,239
uh this is important and and and also uh

1572
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:50,960
other other component is that we need to

1573
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,080
identify the stakeholders uh carefully

1574
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,960
and because the better way we identify

1575
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,880
the stakeholders

1576
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,880
the best we will be able to

1577
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,719
implement the plan so it will be

1578
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:05,040
effective it will be efficient and will

1579
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,679
be able to manage uh incidents of

1580
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:10,239
national significance much more let's

1581
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:12,560
say efficiently and effectively

1582
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,640
because ultimately what will happen is

1583
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,199
that most of the stakeholders will be uh

1584
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,760
involved and they will be connected so

1585
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,560
every stakeholder has a rule to play and

1586
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,280
and for doing that this is where

1587
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:26,800
some sort of a

1588
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,520
risk assessment comes into picture that

1589
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,560
once you go for national cyber uh crisis

1590
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,400
management plan then in that case you

1591
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,080
need to carry out the risk assessment to

1592
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,480
see that who are the stakeholders who

1593
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,960
are connected uh or who should be

1594
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,480
connected to

1595
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:45,040
the uh your whole framework of uh

1596
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,440
incident response or cyber crisis let's

1597
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:50,400
say a plan or cyber crisis framework so

1598
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,520
that uh once uh if in case there is uh

1599
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,719
such a situation uh let's say uh is in

1600
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:58,239
the country and then all these

1601
01:12:58,239 --> 01:12:59,920
stakeholders they could play an

1602
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,239
important role so uh

1603
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:04,480
having said this uh i think it's time

1604
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,560
for us to break for for a little while

1605
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,400
you can stretch your legs and uh let's

1606
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,360
say uh take a cup of coffee or tea and

1607
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:14,320
then come back let's see again uh in 10

1608
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,239
minutes

1609
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:20,560
so guys uh welcome back again uh

1610
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,880
i hope everyone is here uh i could see

1611
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:24,159
uh some

1612
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:27,360
uh 17 participants so before uh now once

1613
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:28,239
again

1614
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:32,320
uh before going uh to the next session

1615
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:35,440
where we can talk about how to design

1616
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,880
uh the national cyber crisis management

1617
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,600
plan so if you still i think you have

1618
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,520
any questions

1619
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,600
you can put up

1620
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,600
into the chat or or even you can raise

1621
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,320
your hand and then uh we can talk about

1622
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,040
it so whenever you feel like uh talking

1623
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,840
uh just uh please raise your hand uh and

1624
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,840
then maybe uh we can

1625
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,080
uh let's say uh take your

1626
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,239
questions and then we can talk about it

1627
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:04,640
so so moving moving moving moving uh

1628
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:05,520
ahead

1629
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,960
um

1630
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,080
part two

1631
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,480
uh that's what inside the plan and

1632
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,560
inside a response not the national

1633
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,040
approach now janitor has been uh talking

1634
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,560
that

1635
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,360
how do we go for designing

1636
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:22,080
this whole national cyber crisis

1637
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,000
management plan

1638
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,840
and as right in the beginning i was i

1639
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,560
was talking about and i was saying that

1640
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,640
incident response incident

1641
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,280
classification uh instant incident

1642
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,440
categorization uh incident

1643
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:38,560
prioritization uh is an important factor

1644
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,000
into any national uh let's say a cyber

1645
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,040
crisis

1646
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,840
management plan so that has to be done

1647
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,719
how that has to be done and that also

1648
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:51,040
it was mentioned into the previous

1649
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,120
uh let's say a discussion where janet i

1650
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,719
mentioned that

1651
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:57,199
we have to have a tlp traffic light

1652
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:58,800
protocol that we can use for

1653
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,960
categorization of the uh type of

1654
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,480
information that

1655
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,719
needs to be uh shared

1656
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:06,719
and that's where uh information uh

1657
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:09,120
sharing and information sharing platform

1658
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:12,480
also comes into a picture

1659
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,840
so with

1660
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:14,719
that

1661
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,880
understanding for you people

1662
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,880
we can continue talking

1663
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:22,560
and to see that how we will be able to

1664
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,880
design the plan so we can go slowly for

1665
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,840
you to understand step by step uh so

1666
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,440
that you understand how it happens okay

1667
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,719
uh so the next uh here

1668
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:37,440
uh is developing so this is what i said

1669
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,120
that how

1670
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,679
we can develop a national cyber crisis

1671
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:43,360
management plan

1672
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,480
and the focus of discussion here is the

1673
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,760
incident response life cycle so many of

1674
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:50,480
you

1675
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,400
must be knowing because those who are

1676
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,080
coming here from the

1677
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,560
cert and the caesar community and for

1678
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,000
them

1679
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,400
it is very uh clear that

1680
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,960
what incident uh response cycle means

1681
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,480
that how uh incident uh normally

1682
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:10,320
is is reported is is analyzed and then

1683
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,800
uh it is contained and

1684
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,320
after the containment how is uh incident

1685
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,440
is resolved and then finally uh how the

1686
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:22,239
incident is is closed so

1687
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:24,560
that cycle we are talking about and and

1688
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:28,159
that cycle is one of the let's say uh

1689
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:30,480
integral uh part of

1690
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:34,080
any uh national cyber crisis management

1691
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:38,159
plan okay so uh if you uh see at the

1692
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:40,080
basis of categorization of information

1693
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,640
as i mentioned before is the traffic

1694
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,840
light protocol okay

1695
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,800
so if uh i get back to the

1696
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,719
next slide uh

1697
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:52,080
this is

1698
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:55,120
where uh something uh we can uh talk

1699
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,120
about it different types of incident

1700
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:00,480
handling frameworks are available uh

1701
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,480
nest is already there uh science is

1702
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,600
there uh iso

1703
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:08,480
27005 is there uh ideal uh incident uh

1704
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:11,199
response framework is there uh even uh

1705
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:14,239
let's say uh and the the power of

1706
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:17,199
first uh services uh framework uh is is

1707
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,360
there so there are many more in fact so

1708
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:22,320
all these are a different uh incident

1709
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,640
handing framework and and and depending

1710
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,080
uh upon the uh search and the users uh

1711
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:31,360
what they normally want to let's say a

1712
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:34,560
follow or even any other

1713
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,800
organization wants to follow any

1714
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,440
approach or any framework for uh

1715
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,760
incident handling that could always be

1716
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:42,840
done but

1717
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,840
now our focus sorry

1718
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,280
is here is that how these uh or how this

1719
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,840
incident handing framework can be used

1720
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,040
uh for

1721
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,880
uh our

1722
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:58,239
cyber crisis management uh plan uh

1723
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:00,719
design and that's what we are saying

1724
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:04,640
that these frameworks could be used okay

1725
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:05,600
now

1726
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,800
once

1727
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,239
i got about the

1728
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:10,239
process of incident handling and these

1729
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:12,719
are the steps already i talked about it

1730
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:14,640
but uh now

1731
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,600
if i say uh as per this cycle what we're

1732
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,239
going to follow one is preparation uh

1733
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:22,000
detection and analysis

1734
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,280
containment eradication recovery and and

1735
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,000
oppose uh incident activity so that's

1736
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,440
the normal cycle

1737
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,280
of the incident response

1738
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,159
which

1739
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:35,040
is a kind of a traditional cycle which

1740
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,640
we all know okay

1741
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:40,159
now uh as you may be knowing

1742
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:42,400
uh that that does the cycle looks like

1743
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,760
uh if you see

1744
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,400
so a preparation

1745
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,199
this talks about how you uh prepare for

1746
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:52,000
an incident and and uh preparing for an

1747
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,239
incident there are different things here

1748
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:55,040
so

1749
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,640
preparation means that

1750
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,000
any team

1751
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,560
any team which is let's say handling uh

1752
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:01,600
incidents

1753
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,120
so how

1754
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:07,840
that team should be let's say having the

1755
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:08,960
proper

1756
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,640
policies the tools and then the standard

1757
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,159
operating procedures

1758
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:17,360
already in place in order for that team

1759
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,920
to prepare for that incident handling

1760
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,880
same thing applies here so uh and

1761
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,880
the same thing needs to be reflected

1762
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,560
also into your cyber crisis management

1763
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,159
plan because that that's a kind of a

1764
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:33,199
cycle and ultimately uh what

1765
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:35,600
is the understanding here is

1766
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,800
when we are talking about this plan so

1767
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,440
uh this plan leads to what this then

1768
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:44,719
leads to the resolution of a critical

1769
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:46,560
incident at the end of the day

1770
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:49,600
so if your country uh let's say is hit

1771
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,000
by a kind of a

1772
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,560
critical attack and and that critical

1773
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,360
attack has done a considerable damage to

1774
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,880
let's say your infrastructure of your

1775
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,480
country could be to the critical

1776
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:01,679
infrastructure it could be any other

1777
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:03,120
infrastructure which is considered as

1778
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:06,960
critical then in that case uh this plan

1779
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,600
normally uh let's say is applicable and

1780
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,760
that's what uh janet i mentioned about

1781
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:15,120
it so preparation is this okay

1782
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:18,239
now detection and analysis so again

1783
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:21,360
important uh element in any particular

1784
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,040
uh

1785
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,400
the incident

1786
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,280
plan

1787
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,199
is to have as part of the cycle of

1788
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:30,000
incident handling detection and analysis

1789
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,880
so how an incident is detected so that

1790
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,600
also uh kind of uh

1791
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,760
let's say process you need to to have

1792
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:38,639
and then

1793
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:40,080
secondly you need to have that kind of

1794
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,920
expertise also where your people who are

1795
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,639
managing and handing incidents they have

1796
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:49,679
the know how how to detect and how to

1797
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:52,080
analyze and any incident handler who is

1798
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,800
sitting into any organization handling

1799
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,199
the incident he has to know this and

1800
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:58,960
that's what comes to the part of

1801
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,400
detection and analysis okay so how an

1802
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:06,159
incident is detected next one how is it

1803
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:08,639
analyzed so now we need to analyze it so

1804
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:10,800
analyze it means that that's why

1805
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:11,760
we will

1806
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,920
we were also uh and we have discussed a

1807
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,080
little bit about uh janet i mentioned

1808
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,159
about classification how do you classify

1809
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:19,520
it

1810
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,080
so whether the incident uh is uh highly

1811
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,199
critical where the incident is critical

1812
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:27,199
then the whether let's say

1813
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:31,040
after that whether the incident is is

1814
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,840
another form of let's say a criticality

1815
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,920
so from high to let's say a medium and

1816
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:41,840
to the let's say low criticality so high

1817
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:44,800
criticality medium criticality and low

1818
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,199
criticality so these are just friendly

1819
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:49,840
civilities case which already uh you may

1820
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,920
be knowing and based on to this case

1821
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,600
only we

1822
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,080
do the categorization when we do the

1823
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,920
classification and based on the

1824
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,880
classification which we have then we try

1825
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:03,920
to analyze the incident okay

1826
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,199
now what is next

1827
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:07,440
so after detection and analysis if we

1828
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,760
see then we are talking about how the

1829
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:12,239
incident is contained this is uh

1830
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:13,199
another

1831
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:15,360
part of the cycle and which we need to

1832
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,520
understand and uh

1833
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,719
it has to be because any incident which

1834
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:21,440
uh

1835
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,560
strikes

1836
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,760
or or hits any system that has to be

1837
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,159
contained uh ultimately at the end of

1838
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:30,239
the day so here also we talked about the

1839
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:33,440
containment and then actions taken to

1840
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:37,040
eradicate the incident so eradication is

1841
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,360
also this is a part of the instant

1842
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,800
handing cycle because we need to remove

1843
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,120
it so once it's removed and then that's

1844
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:46,560
where it leads to the recovery of from

1845
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,400
that incident so how do you recover from

1846
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,960
the incident so that's the next step

1847
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,360
and this step uh is into the category of

1848
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:56,480
containment eradication and recovery and

1849
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:59,920
that's where we are saying that

1850
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,719
that's a part of let's say our

1851
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:04,960
another phase of

1852
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,719
incident handling

1853
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:09,440
cycle okay and then uh the next one is

1854
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,440
the post incident activity the actions

1855
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,480
taken after the incident and

1856
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,800
this particular

1857
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,480
let's say flow

1858
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,199
applies in different forms so if we talk

1859
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:23,920
about nist if you think about uh sans if

1860
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,239
you talk about iso if you talk about

1861
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:28,000
let's say itu incident handling

1862
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,080
framework if you talk about let's say uh

1863
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:31,360
even

1864
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,760
to a certain extent uh the flow services

1865
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,040
framework

1866
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,120
it allows you to

1867
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,880
do that but

1868
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,320
maybe the approach is different okay so

1869
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,320
depending on the needs depending on the

1870
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:46,159
situation depending on the type of

1871
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:47,679
organization

1872
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:51,040
you have you can always apply that but

1873
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,199
now our focus here is

1874
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:56,159
in terms of let's say this is a national

1875
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:59,040
uh let's say uh plan where there has to

1876
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,600
be a standard practice which needs to be

1877
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,840
followed by any team who will be

1878
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,960
responsible for handling incident when

1879
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:09,760
there is a crisis situation so that's

1880
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,560
one flow okay now let me elaborate a

1881
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,679
little bit more on to uh this flow so

1882
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:18,320
preparation so preparation

1883
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,639
and so the some key points which i

1884
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:22,560
wanted to to to pick up

1885
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:26,000
from this slide uh is if you see

1886
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,159
we are talking about uh uh sorry uh we

1887
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:32,960
uh i think uh uh here if i can

1888
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:35,760
uh um take some sort of uh

1889
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:36,719
uh

1890
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:37,440
uh

1891
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:40,239
pens so uh here so i mean uh i'm a much

1892
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:45,040
more uh uh interested uh look if

1893
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,679
so we are saying that

1894
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:49,600
what it normally uh

1895
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,440
preparation is based on

1896
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:54,159
policies the tools and the procedures uh

1897
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:55,760
and effective governance and the

1898
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,719
communication so that what we need to

1899
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:01,040
have so uh

1900
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,719
policy means that we need to have

1901
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:04,960
instant handing policy

1902
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,639
that's what policy means here an

1903
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:09,360
incident handing policy uh clearly is

1904
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,360
spells out that

1905
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:13,840
how we will be handling incidents

1906
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:17,360
and same thing we have to have it into

1907
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:20,639
your let's say national cyber crisis

1908
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:22,639
management plan now the tools tools are

1909
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:24,639
again important because

1910
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:26,639
until or unless you do not have the

1911
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:29,600
tools how will you handle the incidents

1912
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,440
right

1913
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,600
so that's what uh tools mean so tools

1914
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,600
means that we are talking about the

1915
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,040
analysis tools we're talking about the

1916
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,880
reporting rules we are talking about the

1917
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,760
forensic tools um we are talking about

1918
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,679
monitoring those so we are talking about

1919
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:46,320
the information sharing uh platform we

1920
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,480
are talking about uh here the security

1921
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,639
operations center from where let's say

1922
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:51,440
uh

1923
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:54,080
they are feeding to our uh information

1924
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,719
sharing platforms so the the these kind

1925
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:57,600
of things we are talking about

1926
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,760
procedures means that um

1927
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:02,480
standard uh operating procedures so if

1928
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,639
it is let's say a ransomware or if it is

1929
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:07,360
a dos attack or if it is a dos attack or

1930
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,679
or if it is a

1931
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:12,400
malware or or it's a road kit or it

1932
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,320
could be a zero day or it could be apt

1933
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:15,760
whatever it is

1934
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,840
okay so for that procedures are

1935
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,440
important so procedures are written and

1936
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,440
and that will be the part of this

1937
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,239
cyber crisis management plan because

1938
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:27,679
here in cyber crisis situation uh we are

1939
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:30,239
talking about systems which are really a

1940
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:33,440
critical for the country and where if

1941
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,440
those kind of systems if they are

1942
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,159
attacked then definitely the country

1943
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:40,719
doesn't work

1944
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:43,280
it means uh i'm talking about let's say

1945
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:46,159
uh electrical grid i'm talking about

1946
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:47,920
water supply i'm talking about

1947
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:50,000
telecommunication assistance i'm talking

1948
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,760
about let's say

1949
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,840
right now we're having a covered all

1950
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,199
around the world so i'm talking about

1951
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:58,000
the health systems

1952
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,679
so these these kind of systems for that

1953
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:03,280
and and this is what

1954
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,760
and why the reason for the countries to

1955
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,520
come up with the national cyber crisis

1956
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,360
management plan is this

1957
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,880
okay

1958
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,800
so the these procedures needs to be

1959
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:13,600
there

1960
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:16,000
effective governance right and why

1961
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,320
effective governance because there is a

1962
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,920
layering and janitor has been talking

1963
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:22,719
about there are different let's say

1964
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:25,280
uh uh

1965
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,600
level of understanding here because

1966
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,600
there are top there's a top management

1967
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:31,199
there are technical people

1968
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:33,040
there is a communication people so it

1969
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:36,639
means that everyone has the role to play

1970
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:38,880
because once there is that kind of a

1971
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,199
situation in the country then a

1972
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:42,960
technical team doesn't have time to

1973
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,120
communicate

1974
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:48,000
technical team cannot take decisions

1975
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,480
it has to come up from up so if it has

1976
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,000
to come from up

1977
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,280
we should be having effective governance

1978
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,760
framework or effective governance in

1979
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,040
place

1980
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,639
and meaning to say that

1981
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:03,440
what this uh let's say governance means

1982
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,840
uh she has been talking she has been

1983
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,360
saying that we can have a national cyber

1984
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,719
security committee you can have a

1985
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:11,120
national security council you can have

1986
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,480
an

1987
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:16,639
any other national uh apex committee uh

1988
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:19,840
which let's say oversees the whole uh

1989
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,280
let's say uh

1990
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:24,239
coordination of that kind of an incident

1991
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:25,600
uh if that

1992
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:29,360
type of incident destructs the country

1993
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:32,000
or attack let's say happens

1994
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,800
okay

1995
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:35,280
so that's what effective governance uh

1996
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:38,400
means uh uh here and and that's uh what

1997
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,159
we are trying to

1998
01:28:40,159 --> 01:28:42,719
talk about okay

1999
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:45,360
now uh if also uh

2000
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:48,400
i move on uh uh and and then it also

2001
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,320
implies that that necessary controls are

2002
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,679
in place to require and continue

2003
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:53,440
operations after an incident is uh

2004
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,679
discovered that's again the part of

2005
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:57,440
let's say preparation this is again

2006
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:58,800
important so if

2007
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,280
if i say a necessary controls what does

2008
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,800
it mean

2009
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,639
necessary controls and and these

2010
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,639
necessary controls what does it mean is

2011
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:08,320
that we we

2012
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:11,760
we have uh uh for example uh kind of a

2013
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,719
tool to do controls so it means that we

2014
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:16,880
we have that control so that if there is

2015
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,480
analysis to be done we have different

2016
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,719
types of let's say

2017
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:22,880
tools available so necessary contours

2018
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,880
are impressive because if you do not

2019
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:27,360
have those contours and and then to

2020
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,600
recover means that we are talking about

2021
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,679
let's say a full fledged procedure

2022
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:34,159
whether we have it or not

2023
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:36,800
okay so that's that that's what

2024
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:39,280
we need to understand out of

2025
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,360
the preparation right so the country is

2026
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:42,960
prepared and have the procedures in

2027
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:43,840
place

2028
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,600
in the event of a cyber incident of

2029
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,440
national significance so

2030
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:50,239
now uh one point to be taken here is

2031
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:51,440
that

2032
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,440
for preparation

2033
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:56,480
what it means is that it is clearly

2034
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,440
spelled out into that particular plan

2035
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:02,400
who does what

2036
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:05,280
so who does what this is one

2037
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,920
i mean if i need person x

2038
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:10,080
where i'm going to get that person

2039
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:13,199
do i have his contact details

2040
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:15,760
uh do i know that whether that person uh

2041
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,520
let's say

2042
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,360
will be available in terms of let's see

2043
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:20,400
if there's a row string kind of

2044
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:21,520
everything done

2045
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:24,080
now there is also a protocol set where

2046
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:26,480
if there is a kind of a national

2047
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:30,400
uh let's say uh incident uh where uh if

2048
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,639
in cases of that kind so the persons

2049
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:35,600
those who are or the part of that team

2050
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,840
they should not be moving out very far

2051
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,600
from their houses for example if listed

2052
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,280
telecommunication lines are down how i'm

2053
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,960
going to go and let's say take that

2054
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,120
person so i need to ensure that that

2055
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,520
person he already understands that he

2056
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,600
will be around his house or his abuse

2057
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:52,080
out so that i can ask somebody to go and

2058
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,920
pick him up and then he comes back let's

2059
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:57,280
see in order to manage that incident so

2060
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:58,880
this kind of preparation we are talking

2061
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,560
about because

2062
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:03,040
you never know that what kind of uh

2063
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,880
let's say uh

2064
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,120
disruption is there and and what kind of

2065
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:10,560
incident that is trucks you can take

2066
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:13,120
so if your uh telecommunication lines

2067
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:14,840
are fully down you can't even

2068
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:16,639
communicate

2069
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:17,760
so this

2070
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:21,280
this sort of uh let's say

2071
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,639
this dimension and this kind of a

2072
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:25,760
magnitude of uh this document is so

2073
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,520
that's what we need to understand here

2074
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,040
at how it works okay

2075
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,920
now let me move on a little bit so if i

2076
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,080
go here

2077
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,719
in the uh preparation and i think uh

2078
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:39,199
this is a very good slide and and

2079
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:42,239
janitor has been uh talking about it and

2080
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:43,199
and

2081
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:46,320
that talking was much more in terms of

2082
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:48,159
the legal and the regulatory majors

2083
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:51,040
right uh legal and regulatory majors and

2084
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,239
uh

2085
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:54,400
we need to have those and that legal and

2086
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,679
regulatory images the nationals

2087
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:56,719
affecting cyber security and

2088
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:59,280
international obligations so

2089
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,280
why you need that even in the legal and

2090
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,040
the regulatory images you can have the

2091
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,480
setup of this apex committee which we

2092
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,120
are talking about

2093
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:08,880
so let's say national cyber security

2094
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:10,000
committee

2095
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,560
so this is already set up into the law

2096
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,560
so then it functions the way it has been

2097
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,719
set it up so not necessarily it has to

2098
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:19,120
be in law but if it is in the law then

2099
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,120
definitely let's say it's much more

2100
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,239
structured

2101
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:24,639
now organizational majors she mentioned

2102
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:26,960
as she mentioned that um setting up a

2103
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:29,520
national certain or any other uh

2104
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:32,000
incident response let's say a team and

2105
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,280
and also the development of the plan and

2106
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,040
that's what we're talking about here

2107
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:38,960
technical images

2108
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:42,239
this i think uh she clearly uh discussed

2109
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:44,480
what are they uh different types of

2110
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,960
tools different uh types of forensic

2111
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:49,199
policy uh

2112
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:52,000
tools and and the forensic hardware

2113
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,960
availability uh the labs and people are

2114
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:58,080
trained a forensic analyst and they they

2115
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,800
they they are there uh plus also we have

2116
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,120
people uh from the cyber security side

2117
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,040
of let's say understanding they

2118
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:07,120
understand inside response very well law

2119
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:09,520
enforcement is also trained so this is

2120
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:10,960
all like kind of a combination and

2121
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:14,000
mixture once they are sitting together

2122
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,120
they'll be able to do it better now also

2123
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:19,440
other thing is awareness raising majors

2124
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:22,639
and education this is again important

2125
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:24,639
why it is important because

2126
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:26,159
we need to understand we need to know

2127
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:28,800
that what we are doing

2128
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,480
and if the person who is going to be

2129
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,000
involved or who is involved he knows

2130
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,520
that what he has to do

2131
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,520
plus also other people those who are

2132
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,840
around they need to understand that what

2133
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,679
will be their role once this kind of

2134
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:40,880
situation

2135
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:42,960
evolves

2136
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,280
so that that's the part of the uh

2137
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:46,480
preparation

2138
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:50,719
okay now the detection and analysis

2139
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:53,600
that's something also

2140
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:54,639
important

2141
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:56,560
because ultimately

2142
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,840
the the

2143
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,360
expertise which we need to have in the

2144
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,560
team

2145
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,400
who will be the incident response team

2146
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,080
and the incident response team is one of

2147
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:05,760
the uh

2148
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:09,199
let's say team or teams uh which form

2149
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:12,560
part of let's say the the the

2150
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:15,520
uh let's say national uh cyber crisis

2151
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:17,280
management plan okay

2152
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,560
so that's just the part which comes into

2153
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:23,679
detection and analysis so we need to

2154
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:26,560
understand how we'll be able to uh

2155
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,960
detect and analyze the incident then

2156
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:32,239
only we'll be able to let's see educate

2157
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:33,520
that so this is one of the most

2158
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:35,280
challenging phase to detect successfully

2159
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:37,760
detect an incident and if so the type

2160
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,760
extent and magnitude of the problem

2161
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:41,119
so it means that

2162
01:34:41,119 --> 01:34:43,440
if we uh talked about

2163
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:44,719
the the

2164
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:47,199
type of malwares which which comes and

2165
01:34:47,199 --> 01:34:48,800
sits into this data system and they

2166
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,960
start let's say slowing down the whole

2167
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,000
uh

2168
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,440
let's say functioning of those kind of

2169
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:56,080
systems and and then they finally crash

2170
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:58,800
so what kind of let's say threat a trade

2171
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,280
what kind of uh let's say

2172
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,840
malware or a virus which is sitting

2173
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,199
inside which is let's just slowing it

2174
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:07,679
down and that's what we need to

2175
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:10,480
let's say analyze and detect okay so

2176
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,560
first of all detect and then analyze

2177
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:15,040
that what kind of uh

2178
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,960
malware is this and what kind of damage

2179
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,239
it is doing

2180
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:19,840
so that that's what comes from the

2181
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:22,320
detection analysis so after an incident

2182
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:25,119
is uh detected an initial analysis

2183
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:27,280
should be performed to determine the

2184
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:29,920
incident scope such as which networks

2185
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:32,960
systems or applications are affected who

2186
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,960
or what

2187
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,639
originated the incident from where it

2188
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:38,239
has come or they see

2189
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:41,440
what has caused this incident to happen

2190
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,199
and how the incident

2191
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:45,520
is is occurring what tools or attack

2192
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,679
methods are being used

2193
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:49,760
if let's say

2194
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,440
any vulnerability that has been

2195
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:52,800
exploited

2196
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:53,920
so

2197
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:57,600
all this is the part of detection and

2198
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,239
analysis okay

2199
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:02,639
so i'll move on uh

2200
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:03,520
here

2201
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:04,400
maybe

2202
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:05,920
i'll be quickly

2203
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,840
uh summing up this

2204
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,199
slide

2205
01:36:09,199 --> 01:36:10,400
which i think

2206
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:12,639
already you understand and have an idea

2207
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:13,600
uh

2208
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,520
sources through which an incident may be

2209
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,400
detected because um we need to have this

2210
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:21,199
tools uh in place or we need to

2211
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:23,679
implement uh different tools uh in in

2212
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:26,400
order to detect the incident

2213
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:30,960
so uh basics of them uh uh ias ips

2214
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,719
uh cm that's the

2215
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:34,000
uh

2216
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,560
security information event management um

2217
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,880
this is much more like a let's say

2218
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:41,119
uh a log analysis tool

2219
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:44,000
um which uh very much let's say forms

2220
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,119
part of the

2221
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:47,119
security operation center because

2222
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:49,360
security operation center they monitor

2223
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:52,159
the threat they capture the threat and

2224
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:54,480
they uh lock that threat they analyze

2225
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,880
the threat and after the analysis they

2226
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:59,360
try to eliminate that threat so that's

2227
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:02,320
that's what detection analysis is so uh

2228
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,080
and uh this is where we have been

2229
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,159
talking about to have the technical

2230
01:37:06,159 --> 01:37:09,040
major and technical major is this okay

2231
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:13,280
so antivirus software uh file integrity

2232
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,199
checking softwares logs third party

2233
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:16,800
monitoring services

2234
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,880
uh information on new vulnerabilities

2235
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,719
and exploits so that's where our

2236
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:23,040
different feats

2237
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,119
are going to help us where we can have

2238
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:27,119
these different feats

2239
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:30,159
let's see subscribe into our system we

2240
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:32,560
are watching onto that and and then

2241
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:35,199
if there is any uh vulnerability which

2242
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:37,280
is critical then that could be addressed

2243
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,040
accordingly using let's say the

2244
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:41,600
workarounds of that vulnerability or the

2245
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:44,320
advisory of that vulnerability once it

2246
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,800
is let's say issued we can take it up

2247
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,199
and then because that also happens uh

2248
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:50,800
frost because if there's any other

2249
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,800
ability which is critical so then when

2250
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:55,119
does they try to find it out its

2251
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:56,960
advisory as soon as possible and release

2252
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:58,960
it so that all the users were using

2253
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:01,520
those systems they will be able to

2254
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:05,440
bash their systems accordingly okay

2255
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,679
people from inside and outside so

2256
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:09,199
these are all

2257
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:12,400
ways of detection analysis okay

2258
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,320
now

2259
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:16,080
attack vectors may be through the web

2260
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:19,199
the email uh removable media so meaning

2261
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:22,000
to say that from where it has come so

2262
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,400
that that also we need to uh

2263
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:27,280
detect and analyze that

2264
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:28,239
through

2265
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:30,719
which let's say uh

2266
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:34,960
way uh our systems were infected either

2267
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:36,320
could be a number of ways because it

2268
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:39,119
could be and let's say uh this is all we

2269
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:40,800
mentioned here okay

2270
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,080
this phase

2271
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,159
also includes the declaration in initial

2272
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:47,199
classification of the incident

2273
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:48,080
and

2274
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:49,760
classification

2275
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:52,080
anyway

2276
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:55,638
sorry guys

2277
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,320
initial classification of the incident

2278
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:01,840
so classification is important that's

2279
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:03,920
what we are saying

2280
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,840
and the incidents have to be classified

2281
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:08,239
and how they'll be classified uh i will

2282
01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:10,639
talk about it let's say uh after some

2283
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:12,320
time and that's the part of the

2284
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:14,400
discussion here itself okay

2285
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,159
now the initial analysis i should

2286
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:17,760
provide enough information for the team

2287
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:21,040
to uh prioritize subsequent activities

2288
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:22,800
right such as containment of the

2289
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,880
incident and deeper analysis of the

2290
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,800
effects of let's say

2291
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,800
the incident which also helps in

2292
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,880
determining whether the incident is of

2293
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:33,199
financial significance or not so

2294
01:39:33,199 --> 01:39:35,119
that's where

2295
01:39:35,119 --> 01:39:37,360
this particular and the crisis

2296
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:40,560
management plan talks about so it means

2297
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:43,440
what we are trying to do here is we have

2298
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:45,440
the classification and we have the

2299
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:47,840
prioritization so the moment we have the

2300
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,800
classification and the prioritization so

2301
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,800
classification means that there is an

2302
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:54,400
incident category

2303
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,639
and a one good example i can give it to

2304
01:39:56,639 --> 01:39:58,080
you if you go and look at the mitral

2305
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:01,040
attack uh tax tsunami so this let's say

2306
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:03,840
talks about the different types of

2307
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:04,800
attacks so already there is a

2308
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,320
classification for

2309
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:07,840
us to take it from that particular

2310
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,840
that's a wonderful document anyway

2311
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:12,960
so if those let's say countries and and

2312
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:15,600
and all of you who are present here and

2313
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,520
and trying to understand that

2314
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:22,000
how how it works then in that case

2315
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,080
we can take that attack tsunami and

2316
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:26,159
after taking that taxonomy it will be

2317
01:40:26,159 --> 01:40:29,600
easier for us to classify uh incidents

2318
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:32,320
and then accordingly let's say go for

2319
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:35,520
their a severity level uh definition

2320
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:37,760
that what is let's say critical what is

2321
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,600
less critical and then accordingly you

2322
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,920
define so that's that's the part what we

2323
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:45,280
need to do into detection and analysis

2324
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:47,360
okay

2325
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:49,280
so uh

2326
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,880
why incident is to be classified i think

2327
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,199
already we have discussed uh um

2328
01:40:53,199 --> 01:40:55,600
why there's a need because accordingly

2329
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,080
uh the whole uh basis of

2330
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,719
handling that type of incident and uh

2331
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:03,040
let's say also

2332
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:04,800
deciding

2333
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,880
whether this incident is of critical

2334
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:09,280
image or not so this is the reason

2335
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:13,679
another reason uh uh i say uh is uh

2336
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:18,960
therefore classifying the incidents okay

2337
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:20,000
so

2338
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,320
these are uh the part of the detection

2339
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,080
and analysis

2340
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:26,239
now if you uh see incident

2341
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:28,400
classification it's just like this is a

2342
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:33,119
plain example uh if you look at the

2343
01:41:33,119 --> 01:41:34,239
microwave

2344
01:41:34,239 --> 01:41:37,119
attack taxonomy that's very bulky so

2345
01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:39,920
virus the rooms and the spyware

2346
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:41,600
in that category i'm having malware

2347
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:44,400
families uh now secret injection root

2348
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:47,199
rose so that's the part of the intrusion

2349
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:49,600
we can classify this way as well

2350
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:52,000
identity theft and the scans so that's

2351
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,080
that's the part of the fraud so we can

2352
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:57,119
we can also

2353
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:02,000
classify uh in these lines uh security

2354
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,480
breaches and otherwise axis so these are

2355
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:06,239
all different uh

2356
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:09,360
examples of incident classification so

2357
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:12,239
that's how we need to and we should be

2358
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:15,440
classifying it and once you classify

2359
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:18,239
then after the classification the next

2360
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:21,280
step i should be defining the let's say

2361
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:25,199
its priorities or a severity okay

2362
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:27,679
so uh that's

2363
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:30,159
what i say the severity level after

2364
01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:32,400
incident analysis that's the next thing

2365
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:34,320
we are going to look at it

2366
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:36,239
the potential danger and urgency for

2367
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:37,760
responding the incident that's that's

2368
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:39,840
the priority uh just say

2369
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:42,159
the functional and information impact of

2370
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:43,920
the incident

2371
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:46,239
so this also we need to that's what

2372
01:42:46,239 --> 01:42:47,920
analysis means so once we need to

2373
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:49,440
analyze

2374
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:51,760
so with analysis what is going to come

2375
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:53,280
out is that

2376
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:56,719
what is the impact like of that incident

2377
01:42:56,719 --> 01:42:57,440
so

2378
01:42:57,440 --> 01:43:00,719
with that impact we will be able to know

2379
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:03,520
that what is its criticality factor and

2380
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:06,560
accordingly let's say we are going to

2381
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:09,600
respond to that incident handing and

2382
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,280
resolution

2383
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:12,880
and also the level of investment or

2384
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:15,040
resources required to respond to

2385
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,880
the incident this is also important

2386
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:18,480
because

2387
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:20,400
why it is important because we need to

2388
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:24,080
be equipped and once we are equipped

2389
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:26,080
with the tools with the let's say

2390
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:27,920
controls and

2391
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:30,320
with the people uh who should be the

2392
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:33,040
right people to handle uh the incidents

2393
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:36,080
example is incident handlers and once

2394
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:37,520
you have these kind of people in the

2395
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:38,480
team

2396
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:40,880
and they're required for let's say doing

2397
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:43,600
the incident handling so

2398
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:47,600
this is also a point to be considered

2399
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:50,960
once we are talking about the analysis

2400
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:53,360
of any particular incident which forms

2401
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:58,239
the part of the incident handling cycle

2402
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:00,400
and uh

2403
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:03,199
here as i said

2404
01:44:03,199 --> 01:44:04,960
some criteria for determining the

2405
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:06,960
security level uh yes

2406
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:09,520
impact functional information

2407
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:11,600
uh recoverability

2408
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:13,199
um so functional means incidents that

2409
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:14,880
may impact the business functionality of

2410
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:16,239
a nation

2411
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:19,440
uh thus a dos attack of a site

2412
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:21,840
defacement

2413
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:24,560
thus into this category not only this

2414
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:26,080
kind of category you can have you can

2415
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:28,639
have your own categories defined so

2416
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:32,320
this is one just let's say format or

2417
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:35,280
template or an example whatever you call

2418
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:38,719
it as but there are different ways of

2419
01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:42,320
let's say uh defining the civility level

2420
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,960
so means you can classify

2421
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:48,480
as per the incident types only or as per

2422
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:51,280
the let's say threats uh and then you

2423
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:54,159
can define its civility levels it means

2424
01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:56,960
uh impact of course for that

2425
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:59,280
threat you have to have its impact and

2426
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:01,199
then as for the impact

2427
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:03,520
then we have to define its severity

2428
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:05,520
level okay

2429
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:07,920
so that that does something how uh let's

2430
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:12,400
say uh it it works uh and and here also

2431
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:14,719
if you see uh information in in that

2432
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:16,480
category instance may affect the

2433
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:18,800
confidentiality uh integrity and

2434
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:20,960
availability of uh nation's information

2435
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:22,320
so

2436
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:25,119
that's also uh because cia

2437
01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:27,840
anyway is the uh let's say basic

2438
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:30,080
principle or principles of cyber

2439
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:32,960
security and at the end of the day

2440
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:34,320
any information

2441
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:37,520
uh is is at stake when it's let's say

2442
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:38,880
confidentiality or integrity and

2443
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:41,360
availability is at stake so that part

2444
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:42,960
also

2445
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:45,360
uh we need to uh talk about and the

2446
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:47,119
example which uh we have given here is

2447
01:45:47,119 --> 01:45:49,040
malicious attack and gathering a

2448
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:52,000
sensitive information it means that uh

2449
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,440
there is an attack and out of that

2450
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:56,320
attack uh the government uh sent uh data

2451
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:58,080
center is attack and then the

2452
01:45:58,080 --> 01:45:59,760
information is pulled out from from

2453
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:02,159
there so that's what

2454
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:05,040
information uh impact here means

2455
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,119
now uh

2456
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:10,400
the require requirability from uh let's

2457
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:11,760
say recovery we are having the

2458
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:13,840
recoverability the size of the incident

2459
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,920
and the type of resources it affects

2460
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:17,520
will determine the amount of time and

2461
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:18,880
resources that must be spent on

2462
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:21,199
recovering from that incident so uh in

2463
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:22,719
some instances it is not possible to

2464
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:24,719
require from an incident because this is

2465
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:27,040
also important because and those who are

2466
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:28,960
into incident handling here and sitting

2467
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:32,080
there they know that for uh incident uh

2468
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:35,040
resolution uh we we have the different

2469
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:38,639
kpis which we need to set so these kpis

2470
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:39,360
are

2471
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,840
are set and and these kpis what they do

2472
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,920
is that they normally

2473
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:45,280
help us to

2474
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:48,000
resolve uh incident uh let's say in a

2475
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,239
short period of time but uh we should

2476
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:53,040
not forget that any incident resolution

2477
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:54,400
or an incident

2478
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:56,960
uh or incident resolution has

2479
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:00,719
or may have number of dependencies so

2480
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:03,119
the more dependencies we have

2481
01:47:03,119 --> 01:47:04,480
the more time it will take the less

2482
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:06,560
dependencies we have the less time it

2483
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:08,639
will take so if i need to reach out to

2484
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:10,480
my isp within my country then the

2485
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:12,560
resolution time will be faster if i need

2486
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:13,840
to reach other

2487
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:16,400
isp outside my country the resolution

2488
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:17,920
time will be longer because i need to go

2489
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:19,760
through diplomatic channel or any other

2490
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:22,320
channel through which i need to reach

2491
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:24,639
out to that isp who is outside my

2492
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:27,119
country in another country and then we

2493
01:47:27,119 --> 01:47:29,600
need to request them and then let's see

2494
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:32,320
the information we get so this all

2495
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,800
depends and and that's why uh we we

2496
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:39,199
talked about the recoverability okay

2497
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:41,360
now also uh here

2498
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:45,040
uh uh thus uh the scale

2499
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:47,199
different types of skills are available

2500
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:49,600
and different types of stability levels

2501
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,199
are also defined

2502
01:47:51,199 --> 01:47:53,679
so low medium high

2503
01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:54,719
critical

2504
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:55,679
then

2505
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:58,239
we can have let's say

2506
01:47:58,239 --> 01:48:00,880
uh could be uh

2507
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:04,159
less critical and then then so on so

2508
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:06,560
that's that's where uh we can define

2509
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:08,960
their factors if you see here level four

2510
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:12,239
is very severe level three uh let's say

2511
01:48:12,239 --> 01:48:15,679
high level uh two is is is the

2512
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:17,760
medium and level one is green level zero

2513
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:20,000
is why uh let's say baseline this is

2514
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,679
white so the the these are the ways how

2515
01:48:23,679 --> 01:48:25,760
uh even if you say level five emergency

2516
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:28,000
that that's the black

2517
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,199
so the black the red the yellow i mean

2518
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:33,199
and the in the light yellow and the

2519
01:48:33,199 --> 01:48:35,679
green and the white

2520
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:36,400
so

2521
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:38,400
that that's like if it's a level five

2522
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,960
that's poses an imminent threat so if

2523
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:42,960
any critical infrastructure is is is

2524
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:45,119
attacked so maybe i think that that's

2525
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:46,800
the category uh or let's say even

2526
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:50,159
ransomware is there which uh in in fact

2527
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:52,719
um how to say

2528
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:56,239
uh obstructs the functioning of uh

2529
01:48:56,239 --> 01:48:59,280
let's say um critical systems then it is

2530
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:01,600
into that category

2531
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:03,679
it is red likely to result in a

2532
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:05,280
significant impact to public health or

2533
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:07,360
safety national security economic

2534
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:09,119
security fund relations or civil

2535
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:10,800
abilities

2536
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,480
so that

2537
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:15,040
this is what level four but now the

2538
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:17,440
point to be taking here is that these

2539
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:20,960
civility levels uh we need to define

2540
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:24,480
uh looking at these aspects and

2541
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:27,119
accordingly the threats we can have into

2542
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:28,400
these categories

2543
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:30,480
okay

2544
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:33,280
now level three high orange likely to

2545
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:35,520
result in a demonstrable impact to

2546
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:36,880
public health or safety national

2547
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:38,719
security economic security foreign

2548
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:40,000
relations so

2549
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,760
that's that's how it goes on so it

2550
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:45,400
drills down to zero and this is

2551
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:48,639
unsubstantiated or inconsequential event

2552
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:50,960
that's level zero baseline white so

2553
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:54,159
maybe it doesn't require

2554
01:49:54,159 --> 01:49:57,119
an immediate action but of course it

2555
01:49:57,119 --> 01:49:59,520
needs to be let's say taken into account

2556
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:02,560
and there is a need for

2557
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:06,159
addressing even the level zero baseline

2558
01:50:06,159 --> 01:50:08,960
uh activity because it means they turn

2559
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:12,159
out to be severe at at a point of time

2560
01:50:12,159 --> 01:50:14,320
okay so that's what uh incident

2561
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:17,440
prioritization uh here we we are talking

2562
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:19,760
about and now here if you see observed

2563
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:22,880
actions uh intended a consequence so

2564
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:25,040
that that's another way of define effect

2565
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:26,880
cause physical consequence

2566
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:28,000
presence

2567
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,639
that's the correct or destroy data

2568
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:33,119
engagement is still sensitive so this is

2569
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:35,040
again how we are

2570
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:37,840
talking in terms of the actions and then

2571
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,040
also its

2572
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:41,199
intended consequence

2573
01:50:41,199 --> 01:50:44,000
so that also comes into

2574
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
the picture and and that kind of let's

2575
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,679
say uh

2576
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:49,840
classification and prioritization we

2577
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:52,159
have to have into your incident plan

2578
01:50:52,159 --> 01:50:53,199
okay

2579
01:50:53,199 --> 01:50:55,119
so uh let me move on

2580
01:50:55,119 --> 01:50:57,280
uh here uh the same thing that's an

2581
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:59,920
example of canada or where we have been

2582
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:02,320
uh talking about level one two three

2583
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:04,560
four so now you know what is in level

2584
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:06,560
one what is in level two what is in

2585
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:09,599
level three level four so that's how

2586
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:11,840
when somebody is going for the

2587
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:14,159
development of this kind of cyber crisis

2588
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:16,480
management plan in their country then

2589
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,080
accordingly they need to move in these

2590
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:20,960
lines so where they're able to have that

2591
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:22,880
risk assessment done and accordingly

2592
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:24,960
they will be able to identify the

2593
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,119
the gaps and and then the issues and

2594
01:51:27,119 --> 01:51:29,920
based on to that they have the

2595
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:31,520
different types of because once you do

2596
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:33,360
the gap assessment or risk assessment

2597
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:35,599
what do you get

2598
01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:37,520
so you you you get that what kind of

2599
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:40,960
threats could uh let's say uh uh

2600
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:43,920
hamper uh your your critical uh

2601
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:45,520
infrastructures or what kind of threats

2602
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:47,679
you're seeing in your country

2603
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:50,400
because in in every country

2604
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:52,480
let's say the cyber threat landscape is

2605
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:54,719
is a little bit different so there are

2606
01:51:54,719 --> 01:51:56,719
certain uh types of

2607
01:51:56,719 --> 01:51:58,719
incidents which are common but there are

2608
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:00,880
certain incidents which are less common

2609
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:03,599
in another country than your country

2610
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:07,040
so that's the reason why we need to have

2611
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:10,320
that level one two three four uh

2612
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:13,520
classification uh to be uh done and and

2613
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:14,239
then

2614
01:52:14,239 --> 01:52:17,920
this is how we need to go on okay

2615
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:19,599
so let me let's move to the next slide

2616
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:21,280
and that's uh

2617
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:24,080
declaring a national cyber instinct

2618
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:27,280
so uh for me to make you understand at

2619
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:29,440
this particular slide

2620
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,599
there is only uh

2621
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:33,760
one uh easy way

2622
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:34,719
is

2623
01:52:34,719 --> 01:52:37,199
now we have reached a stage where we

2624
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:40,239
will be in a position to to to see that

2625
01:52:40,239 --> 01:52:41,840
after a

2626
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:44,560
classification of the incident after a

2627
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,480
prioritization of the incident

2628
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,719
after defining the civility level

2629
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:50,960
impact and the consequence

2630
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:52,719
now you have

2631
01:52:52,719 --> 01:52:54,800
the let's say

2632
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:57,040
a kind of

2633
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:59,760
information availability on the basis of

2634
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:01,520
data availability on the basis of which

2635
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,599
you can say that if this kind of

2636
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:06,719
incident destructs my country then it

2637
01:53:06,719 --> 01:53:10,000
becomes a national cyber incident

2638
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,239
this is the reason of of uh really

2639
01:53:12,239 --> 01:53:13,840
classification otherwise there was no

2640
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:16,719
need for us to do this

2641
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:18,480
and this is what has been saying this is

2642
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:19,840
what has been said

2643
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:22,080
so if there is

2644
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:25,199
an incident of category five

2645
01:53:25,199 --> 01:53:27,599
so it's black if uh let's say

2646
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:30,480
you want to see this uh slide here so

2647
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:33,599
level five emergency black

2648
01:53:33,599 --> 01:53:36,639
so if it is black then normally if i

2649
01:53:36,639 --> 01:53:39,119
come back here so if it is black then it

2650
01:53:39,119 --> 01:53:40,960
you can always declare that it's a

2651
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:43,040
national hybrid incident where we need

2652
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:46,239
to address it immediately

2653
01:53:46,239 --> 01:53:48,239
okay

2654
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:49,760
so this is what it says

2655
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:52,880
so declaring a national cyber instrument

2656
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:54,639
so after the detection and analysis

2657
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:57,280
phase uh whereby the scope impact and

2658
01:53:57,280 --> 01:53:58,480
stability of an incident and its

2659
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:00,800
potential harm has been assessed you

2660
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:03,360
will be in a position to let's say say

2661
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:06,239
that this type of incidence or this type

2662
01:54:06,239 --> 01:54:10,000
of incident will be called as a national

2663
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,360
cyber incident

2664
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:12,080
or

2665
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:15,760
declared as a national cyber incident

2666
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:16,800
okay

2667
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:20,239
now once this is declared then other

2668
01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:21,599
things you need to have

2669
01:54:21,599 --> 01:54:23,599
and what are those things those things

2670
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:26,560
are that now you need to have a sort of

2671
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:29,599
a mechanism in place which

2672
01:54:29,599 --> 01:54:32,480
starts or or which activates

2673
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:35,119
immediately to address this national

2674
01:54:35,119 --> 01:54:37,199
cyber incident and this is where we have

2675
01:54:37,199 --> 01:54:39,199
been talking about the the governance

2676
01:54:39,199 --> 01:54:41,040
and the governance

2677
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:42,159
committee

2678
01:54:42,159 --> 01:54:43,840
this is where we have been talking about

2679
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:45,119
the

2680
01:54:45,119 --> 01:54:47,599
uh incident response teams this is where

2681
01:54:47,599 --> 01:54:48,480
we have been talking about the

2682
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:50,560
communication teams

2683
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:51,679
and and

2684
01:54:51,679 --> 01:54:53,679
this is where we have been uh talking

2685
01:54:53,679 --> 01:54:55,599
about who should be sitting into these

2686
01:54:55,599 --> 01:54:56,800
communication teams who should be

2687
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:59,840
sitting into uh let's say the incident

2688
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:02,960
response team uh how the isps how the

2689
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:05,440
law enforcement how the nationals served

2690
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:07,360
plus other stakeholders we have been

2691
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:09,760
talking about those that how the

2692
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:12,159
stakeholders they should be identified

2693
01:55:12,159 --> 01:55:14,000
and after identification all these

2694
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,480
stakeholders they are the part of it and

2695
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:20,320
they form the part of that team

2696
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:23,920
so that's that's that's how the

2697
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:25,679
declaration of a national cyber incident

2698
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:28,159
will activate the national cyber crisis

2699
01:55:28,159 --> 01:55:31,199
management plan because unless rental

2700
01:55:31,199 --> 01:55:33,040
there is nothing of a national

2701
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:35,199
significance it's not a national level

2702
01:55:35,199 --> 01:55:37,199
cyber incident

2703
01:55:37,199 --> 01:55:38,239
that's what we're trying to make you

2704
01:55:38,239 --> 01:55:39,520
understand

2705
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:41,280
okay

2706
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:44,639
so uh with with this slide maybe uh i'll

2707
01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:46,960
move a little bit uh let's say

2708
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:48,000
more

2709
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:48,960
here

2710
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:51,119
we are saying uh declaring a national

2711
01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:53,280
cyber incident so i think that part is

2712
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:55,520
clear um and and this is much more like

2713
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:57,440
a theoretical part where a national

2714
01:55:57,440 --> 01:55:58,880
service incident is declared if the

2715
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:02,239
security level is high very high orchid

2716
01:56:02,239 --> 01:56:04,960
so if uh if we talk about a scale of 0

2717
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:10,000
to 5 so 5 4 3 is let's say critical very

2718
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,400
high and high

2719
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:15,280
then two one zero uh becomes let's see

2720
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:19,759
medium low and uh let's say very low

2721
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:22,960
so this this is what uh

2722
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:26,159
is the scale which are normally used and

2723
01:56:26,159 --> 01:56:28,880
as i mentioned that many other skills

2724
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:30,960
are available of severity which could be

2725
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:33,119
used by let's say

2726
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:35,360
uh all those teams who wants to come up

2727
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:37,199
with obviously all those countries who

2728
01:56:37,199 --> 01:56:38,800
wants to come up with this kind of a

2729
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:41,040
plan

2730
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:43,440
right

2731
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:46,400
so that that's that's how it works okay

2732
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:49,920
now if i get back to the uh incident

2733
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:53,360
documentation this is also

2734
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:55,440
an important part of it

2735
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:57,599
because ultimately if i talk about

2736
01:56:57,599 --> 01:57:00,080
standard operating procedures

2737
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:02,480
if i talk about the lessons learned

2738
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:03,760
if i talk about the summary of the

2739
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:05,840
incident

2740
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:07,840
if i talk about indicators related to

2741
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:09,119
the incident

2742
01:57:09,119 --> 01:57:10,960
actions taken by all incident handlers

2743
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:13,119
on this incident

2744
01:57:13,119 --> 01:57:15,440
so this is much more like a post

2745
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:17,599
incident activity

2746
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:20,320
and in the post incident activity it

2747
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:22,239
should be documented

2748
01:57:22,239 --> 01:57:26,080
and if it is documented this is or this

2749
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:29,280
becomes kind of a reference document for

2750
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:32,639
us to learn uh from this one and then to

2751
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:34,719
improve upon this one because uh

2752
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:37,599
incident the way uh threat landscape is

2753
01:57:37,599 --> 01:57:38,800
these days

2754
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:41,360
every here and then we see new types of

2755
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:44,000
threats and those new type of threats

2756
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,159
once we start handling them

2757
01:57:46,159 --> 01:57:48,000
at times it happens the team doesn't

2758
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,760
have much idea that how they'll be able

2759
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:52,719
to handle that

2760
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:55,119
so if if this is the case

2761
01:57:55,119 --> 01:57:58,080
then definitely uh what is required here

2762
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:01,119
is the incident documentation and that

2763
01:58:01,119 --> 01:58:03,760
incident documentation uh let's say

2764
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:06,400
consists of these let's say points

2765
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:08,480
the current status of the incident a

2766
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:10,960
summary already i have said also here in

2767
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:12,400
this chain of custody if i have the

2768
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:15,280
cable impact assessment uh related to

2769
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:16,560
the incident

2770
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:18,320
all sorts of evidence gathered during

2771
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:20,159
investigation comments from incident

2772
01:58:20,159 --> 01:58:21,840
coordination team

2773
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:24,719
so the these are all important let's say

2774
01:58:24,719 --> 01:58:27,679
factors which should be documented about

2775
01:58:27,679 --> 01:58:29,360
an incident

2776
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:32,000
and this helps

2777
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,880
so that's also forms part of the let's

2778
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:36,800
say incident

2779
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:40,000
handling cycle okay

2780
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:44,000
uh if if you uh i move on further

2781
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,199
now information sharing and

2782
01:58:45,199 --> 01:58:47,599
communication so this information

2783
01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:50,239
sharing and communication uh this is

2784
01:58:50,239 --> 01:58:51,199
also

2785
01:58:51,199 --> 01:58:52,880
very very important

2786
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:55,679
because uh information sharing so uh

2787
01:58:55,679 --> 01:58:57,040
information sharing and communication

2788
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:59,760
here we are talking much more in terms

2789
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:00,480
of

2790
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:01,280
the

2791
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:04,400
crisis situation so in crisis situation

2792
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:06,960
how information needs to be

2793
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:08,960
shared and communicated to different

2794
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:12,880
teams and also at different levels

2795
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:14,320
so one information sharing and

2796
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:15,760
communication at the level of the core

2797
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:17,199
team who is working in devising the

2798
01:59:17,199 --> 01:59:18,159
incident

2799
01:59:18,159 --> 01:59:19,520
and another aspect of information

2800
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:21,520
sharing and communication is

2801
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:24,719
to the public uh through the let's say

2802
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:25,599
uh

2803
01:59:25,599 --> 01:59:27,280
the the

2804
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:28,560
responsible

2805
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:32,080
institution or ministry or department or

2806
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:33,199
let's say

2807
01:59:33,199 --> 01:59:35,440
national level institution

2808
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:37,199
to pass on the message

2809
01:59:37,199 --> 01:59:38,320
to people

2810
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:40,239
that what is happening

2811
01:59:40,239 --> 01:59:42,960
but here we are much more focused on to

2812
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:44,560
how the information sharing and

2813
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:46,400
communication will be taking place

2814
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:48,639
within the team if you see incident of

2815
01:59:48,639 --> 01:59:50,880
national significance may be shared uh

2816
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:53,360
to the following parties so if i let's

2817
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:55,040
say uh uh

2818
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:57,199
take this

2819
01:59:57,199 --> 01:59:58,400
uh um

2820
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:02,559
here so if you look at here

2821
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:04,800
here we are

2822
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:06,639
so we are talking about the incident of

2823
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:08,080
national significance may be shared to

2824
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:10,000
the following parties so

2825
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,480
one is like government bodies

2826
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:13,920
law enforcement

2827
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:17,119
isps also because and they they help you

2828
02:00:17,119 --> 02:00:19,679
to provide let's say uh

2829
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:22,480
evidence in terms of locks media uh

2830
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:24,000
external parties like international

2831
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,040
service and

2832
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:27,040
citizens customers or constituency

2833
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:27,920
members

2834
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:30,159
so that's why i mean uh from here to

2835
02:00:30,159 --> 02:00:32,719
here that's one level of community one

2836
02:00:32,719 --> 02:00:35,280
type of communication and for this let's

2837
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:38,320
say uh for this particular

2838
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:39,679
audience citizens customers or

2839
02:00:39,679 --> 02:00:41,760
constituency members that's the another

2840
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:43,520
level of communication

2841
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:46,159
so here the communication for them is

2842
02:00:46,159 --> 02:00:46,960
that

2843
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:49,599
uh how you have to

2844
02:00:49,599 --> 02:00:52,639
make them uh comfortable or or you have

2845
02:00:52,639 --> 02:00:54,159
to give them the assurance kind of a

2846
02:00:54,159 --> 02:00:56,080
thing that the country or let's say the

2847
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:58,880
teams are working in order to let's say

2848
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:00,960
uh stop that attack or let's say resolve

2849
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,239
that incident

2850
02:01:02,239 --> 02:01:05,199
that's one but here we are talking much

2851
02:01:05,199 --> 02:01:06,239
more

2852
02:01:06,239 --> 02:01:09,199
listen internally between these teams

2853
02:01:09,199 --> 02:01:11,760
uh i think from here to here uh uh i

2854
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:13,679
think uh that's just the

2855
02:01:13,679 --> 02:01:17,199
block which i wanted to take it

2856
02:01:18,159 --> 02:01:20,800
and and this is between that that's the

2857
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:22,880
incident handling team if you see how

2858
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:24,320
they're doing it

2859
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:25,440
okay

2860
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:27,360
that's that's how it goes on

2861
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:28,159
now

2862
02:01:28,159 --> 02:01:31,440
if uh i go further a little bit uh

2863
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:33,119
that's the information sharing and

2864
02:01:33,119 --> 02:01:34,840
communication that's

2865
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:37,920
already we have discussed uh deliver a

2866
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:40,000
coordinated prompt reliable and

2867
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,280
actionable information to the whole

2868
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:43,360
community and the public as appropriate

2869
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:45,119
through the use of clear consistent

2870
02:01:45,119 --> 02:01:47,360
accessible and culturally and

2871
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:48,880
linguistically appropriate methods to

2872
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:50,159
effectively

2873
02:01:50,159 --> 02:01:51,920
relay information regarding significant

2874
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:53,920
threat and that's why i said that we

2875
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:55,440
have to have a communication team so

2876
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:57,280
communication teams role is to

2877
02:01:57,280 --> 02:02:00,000
communicate with let's say different

2878
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
target audiences

2879
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,760
because technical people may not be

2880
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:05,679
having enough time in order to do so

2881
02:02:05,679 --> 02:02:07,199
because they are busy with the

2882
02:02:07,199 --> 02:02:09,599
resolution of the incident

2883
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:12,000
and mostly technical guys they they they

2884
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:15,040
do not know how to write well

2885
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:17,840
meaning to say that their focus is the

2886
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:19,840
resolution and they are technically they

2887
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:22,159
are good may not be linguistically they

2888
02:02:22,159 --> 02:02:23,840
may be good that's why communication

2889
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:26,639
people they have to unless they capture

2890
02:02:26,639 --> 02:02:29,199
the linguistic part and then

2891
02:02:29,199 --> 02:02:32,400
let's say a draft a kind of a communique

2892
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:35,520
or information or advisory uh in such a

2893
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:38,080
way that it's easy to understand

2894
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:40,400
for a people

2895
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:43,119
let's say for general public and then

2896
02:02:43,119 --> 02:02:45,760
they are able to understand that what is

2897
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:48,000
the line of action they need to take or

2898
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,679
let's say what is happening

2899
02:02:49,679 --> 02:02:52,719
uh on this incident um at this point of

2900
02:02:52,719 --> 02:02:53,920
time

2901
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:56,320
so that's that's what uh information

2902
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:57,679
sharing and communication means here

2903
02:02:57,679 --> 02:03:00,639
okay

2904
02:03:00,639 --> 02:03:03,199
i'll i'll move on uh uh information

2905
02:03:03,199 --> 02:03:05,040
you're sharing using a traffic light

2906
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:06,639
protocol we discussed i think we

2907
02:03:06,639 --> 02:03:08,639
mentioned a number of times uh since we

2908
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:10,239
have started uh let's say this this

2909
02:03:10,239 --> 02:03:12,159
training program um

2910
02:03:12,159 --> 02:03:14,159
and and now already you know that what

2911
02:03:14,159 --> 02:03:15,520
is the importance of the traffic light

2912
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:18,239
protocol and and traffic light protocol

2913
02:03:18,239 --> 02:03:20,159
is one of the standard protocols used

2914
02:03:20,159 --> 02:03:23,760
and um recognized protocol

2915
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:25,119
by uh

2916
02:03:25,119 --> 02:03:27,520
first and many uh other

2917
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:28,880
let's say

2918
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:30,320
institutions

2919
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:33,520
where this standard protocol is used in

2920
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:34,639
order to

2921
02:03:34,639 --> 02:03:35,920
correctly

2922
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:39,280
represent the classification information

2923
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:41,599
that could be a shared let's say with

2924
02:03:41,599 --> 02:03:44,000
different target audiences right that

2925
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,639
that's the uh important

2926
02:03:46,639 --> 02:03:49,199
role this protocol plays and that's why

2927
02:03:49,199 --> 02:03:52,000
we are using uh or we need to use or we

2928
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,360
should be using traffic light protocol

2929
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:55,280
in order to do so okay

2930
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:57,599
so uh i think coloring uh i think you

2931
02:03:57,599 --> 02:04:01,440
all know uh it talks about let's say

2932
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:02,400
the the

2933
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:05,440
uh the the the red the amber

2934
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:08,239
the and the green and the white so uh

2935
02:04:08,239 --> 02:04:10,320
these are the four colors which you

2936
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:13,119
already know and and those colors can be

2937
02:04:13,119 --> 02:04:15,119
used for uh different uh let's see if

2938
02:04:15,119 --> 02:04:16,639
it's red confidential highly

2939
02:04:16,639 --> 02:04:19,360
confidential if it is amber it could be

2940
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:20,560
shared between people and the

2941
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:22,480
organization within organizations if it

2942
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:24,800
is green then it could be shaped by many

2943
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:27,199
more uh on different target audiences if

2944
02:04:27,199 --> 02:04:28,960
it's white then it becomes kind of a

2945
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:30,320
public

2946
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:33,440
information where you can always use it

2947
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:34,400
okay

2948
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:37,599
so uh that's again there

2949
02:04:37,599 --> 02:04:40,000
uh this is where i think already uh i

2950
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,440
have discussed in a way

2951
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:42,960
much information because anyway we will

2952
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:45,520
be uh sharing these slides to all the

2953
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:47,760
participants here so this is a tlp white

2954
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:48,880
slide

2955
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:51,760
which you can always go through and then

2956
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:53,440
you can have a more idea

2957
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:55,119
about red and amber and the green and

2958
02:04:55,119 --> 02:04:56,800
the white and accordingly you can put

2959
02:04:56,800 --> 02:04:59,199
into your let's say national cyber

2960
02:04:59,199 --> 02:05:02,000
crisis management plan uh in order to

2961
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,679
classify information accordingly okay

2962
02:05:05,679 --> 02:05:09,679
so uh that's that's uh other thing and

2963
02:05:09,679 --> 02:05:13,280
now um phase three uh talks about the uh

2964
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:14,800
containment

2965
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:17,280
eradication and recovery

2966
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:20,320
this is also an important phase of this

2967
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:24,159
splitter cycle and and and this cycle

2968
02:05:24,159 --> 02:05:25,440
uh

2969
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:26,639
is

2970
02:05:26,639 --> 02:05:27,599
where

2971
02:05:27,599 --> 02:05:29,840
this phase i should say is the phase

2972
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:32,639
where we try to uh let's say get hold of

2973
02:05:32,639 --> 02:05:35,040
the incident and we are able to

2974
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:36,570
stop that incident

2975
02:05:36,570 --> 02:05:38,320
[Music]

2976
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:40,480
from doing a further

2977
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:41,679
damage to

2978
02:05:41,679 --> 02:05:44,400
your data or information or your systems

2979
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:47,760
okay that's what containment means so if

2980
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:49,280
attack is coming

2981
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:52,320
if you can be able to stop that attack

2982
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:54,560
that's what containment means here

2983
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:56,880
and now eradication means that if there

2984
02:05:56,880 --> 02:06:01,119
was a virus which was let's say

2985
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:04,000
allowing that um

2986
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,320
let's say uh damaging of that

2987
02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:07,360
information

2988
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:09,599
then we have removed that virus so that

2989
02:06:09,599 --> 02:06:12,000
our systems are functioning uh properly

2990
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,760
and they start and they stop

2991
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:16,159
malfunctioning so and recovery means

2992
02:06:16,159 --> 02:06:17,920
that we have been able to recover from

2993
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:19,840
the incident and that's what a cyber

2994
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:22,480
crisis management means so in cyber

2995
02:06:22,480 --> 02:06:25,599
crisis management means recovery a lot

2996
02:06:25,599 --> 02:06:29,199
why because in this particular uh

2997
02:06:29,199 --> 02:06:32,800
a recovery here we are saying recovery

2998
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:36,079
uh to a certain let's say extent so we

2999
02:06:36,079 --> 02:06:38,000
cannot have a hundred percent recovery

3000
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,560
at one go it means that critical let's

3001
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:42,800
say services the critical let's say

3002
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:45,440
functions of the system they are stored

3003
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:47,119
they are working and then slowly and

3004
02:06:47,119 --> 02:06:50,079
slowly let's say we get back to the full

3005
02:06:50,079 --> 02:06:52,320
recovery of the whole system working

3006
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:54,719
normally as it was working before the

3007
02:06:54,719 --> 02:06:56,560
attack was launched onto that particular

3008
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:59,280
system so this makes this here

3009
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:00,800
so the purpose

3010
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:02,960
of this case is to contain and mitigate

3011
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:05,280
the effects of incidents when they occur

3012
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:06,159
so

3013
02:07:06,159 --> 02:07:07,679
that's that's what

3014
02:07:07,679 --> 02:07:09,920
this

3015
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,400
phase talks about so i'll move

3016
02:07:12,400 --> 02:07:15,599
um because we're nearly uh two and a

3017
02:07:15,599 --> 02:07:18,480
half hours discussing this

3018
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:20,079
[Music]

3019
02:07:20,079 --> 02:07:22,719
this particular let's say

3020
02:07:22,719 --> 02:07:24,480
topic

3021
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:26,320
and and here also containment

3022
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:28,560
eradication recovery

3023
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:30,079
uh it talks about the continuity

3024
02:07:30,079 --> 02:07:32,320
strategies now vary based on the type of

3025
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:34,079
incident and may depend on the following

3026
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:36,639
potential damage the need to preserve

3027
02:07:36,639 --> 02:07:37,760
evidence

3028
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:40,159
uh service availability time and

3029
02:07:40,159 --> 02:07:42,719
resources required uh effectiveness of

3030
02:07:42,719 --> 02:07:44,480
the strategy

3031
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:46,560
and duration of the solution and i think

3032
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:49,119
i discussed all on the previous slide so

3033
02:07:49,119 --> 02:07:51,119
uh duration of the solution also as i

3034
02:07:51,119 --> 02:07:54,560
said that it let's say doesn't happen at

3035
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:57,520
one go and it takes time so step by step

3036
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:00,159
and then slowly and slowly uh it is

3037
02:08:00,159 --> 02:08:02,800
respondfully okay

3038
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:05,920
now here also uh

3039
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:08,560
after incident has been contained um

3040
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:10,560
eradication may be unnecessary to

3041
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:12,719
eliminate uh competence of the incident

3042
02:08:12,719 --> 02:08:14,639
such as removal of malicious components

3043
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:16,800
so that's what eradication is so

3044
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:19,599
containment happened and education

3045
02:08:19,599 --> 02:08:22,560
is let's say done in order to remove

3046
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:25,199
those malicious stresses uh from the

3047
02:08:25,199 --> 02:08:27,440
files or the malicious

3048
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:28,400
file

3049
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:31,119
itself and then once that is done then

3050
02:08:31,119 --> 02:08:33,199
the let's say incident has been now

3051
02:08:33,199 --> 02:08:36,719
fully you know eradicated

3052
02:08:36,719 --> 02:08:37,520
and

3053
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:38,960
eradication degrees should be done in

3054
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:40,320
the phase approach so that the

3055
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:42,880
remediation steps are prioritized so and

3056
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:45,360
that's something already we discussed

3057
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:47,920
guys okay

3058
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:49,840
and and that that was the post incident

3059
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:52,320
activity and uh i mentioned um in the

3060
02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:55,599
part of the documentation um that uh in

3061
02:08:55,599 --> 02:08:58,960
the uh documentation is important so now

3062
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:01,920
incident happened it was very critical

3063
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:04,400
we have been able to let's say contain

3064
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:06,079
that incident we have been able to

3065
02:09:06,079 --> 02:09:09,199
educate that incident we have been able

3066
02:09:09,199 --> 02:09:10,880
to recover

3067
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:14,159
fully then after that it is important

3068
02:09:14,159 --> 02:09:17,119
that we document that incident

3069
02:09:17,119 --> 02:09:19,360
and documentation of that incident it

3070
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:23,040
means that that's the lessons learned

3071
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:25,840
so we we we have learned this lesson

3072
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:27,679
from this let's say

3073
02:09:27,679 --> 02:09:28,800
incident

3074
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:30,960
what was done and and

3075
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:32,560
we analyzed that what was done whether

3076
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:34,880
it was uh let's say uh

3077
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:36,079
uh

3078
02:09:36,079 --> 02:09:39,599
good or or or or uh not satisfactory

3079
02:09:39,599 --> 02:09:41,199
and and then

3080
02:09:41,199 --> 02:09:43,760
we try to improve on to that that's what

3081
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:45,760
post instant activity means and i think

3082
02:09:45,760 --> 02:09:48,800
we all know here so but meaning to say

3083
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:51,040
that this also should be forming the

3084
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:54,239
part of the uh your crisis management

3085
02:09:54,239 --> 02:09:56,719
plan so the post event activity phase

3086
02:09:56,719 --> 02:09:58,719
leverages knowledge gained from each

3087
02:09:58,719 --> 02:10:00,800
cyber security event to ensure the

3088
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:02,320
continuous improvement of the cyber

3089
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:04,800
security incident response

3090
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:07,360
and by extension the security posture of

3091
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:09,119
the nation as a whole so the purpose of

3092
02:10:09,119 --> 02:10:10,960
this phase is to formally close

3093
02:10:10,960 --> 02:10:13,119
out the cyber incident by conducting a

3094
02:10:13,119 --> 02:10:16,079
post event analysis so i think that's

3095
02:10:16,079 --> 02:10:19,040
what uh we have written here for you to

3096
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:21,199
understand identifying lessons learned

3097
02:10:21,199 --> 02:10:23,520
so uh i said that when applicable and

3098
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:25,920
driving changes to the security policy

3099
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:28,159
because this also uh gives you an

3100
02:10:28,159 --> 02:10:32,159
opportunity where you could see that uh

3101
02:10:32,159 --> 02:10:33,599
what

3102
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:36,400
went wrong and what went wrong

3103
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:38,239
is something what you need to improve on

3104
02:10:38,239 --> 02:10:40,159
and once you need to improve on then you

3105
02:10:40,159 --> 02:10:42,400
can analyze and review your security

3106
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:45,119
policy and then fine tune it accordingly

3107
02:10:45,119 --> 02:10:47,840
okay so that's uh

3108
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:49,520
what it says here or enterprise security

3109
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:51,920
architecture improvements as required um

3110
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:54,320
so number of things you can let's say

3111
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:56,480
take into consideration into this

3112
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:59,759
particular phase as well

3113
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:03,520
so i'll move on

3114
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:05,440
that's the

3115
02:11:05,440 --> 02:11:07,520
post incident activity that does an

3116
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:09,199
example of the canadian

3117
02:11:09,199 --> 02:11:11,840
cyber security event management plan

3118
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:13,040
so uh

3119
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:14,740
just to give you um

3120
02:11:14,740 --> 02:11:15,920
[Music]

3121
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:16,880
some

3122
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:17,920
uh

3123
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:19,280
sort of uh

3124
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:21,199
idea what does it mean affected

3125
02:11:21,199 --> 02:11:23,440
departments and agencies

3126
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:25,760
so i will produce their own departmental

3127
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:28,239
lessons learned report and action plan

3128
02:11:28,239 --> 02:11:30,960
and contribute to government of canada

3129
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:33,599
wide post event activities as required

3130
02:11:33,599 --> 02:11:35,760
now government of canada and computer

3131
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:37,360
instant response will collate all

3132
02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:39,440
departmental findings and produce a

3133
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:41,199
post-event report so it means that

3134
02:11:41,199 --> 02:11:44,960
different stakeholders they have the

3135
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:46,400
different responsibility of let's

3136
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:48,480
suppose incident activity and

3137
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:51,199
accordingly they will do that

3138
02:11:51,199 --> 02:11:53,679
uh treasury board of canada a secretary

3139
02:11:53,679 --> 02:11:55,840
art and that's uh something chief

3140
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:57,760
information officer brand will produce a

3141
02:11:57,760 --> 02:12:00,480
lesson report in action on behalf of the

3142
02:12:00,480 --> 02:12:02,560
government of canada and monetary

3143
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:04,400
implementation of the recommendations if

3144
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:06,480
you see now the government operation

3145
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:08,079
center

3146
02:12:08,079 --> 02:12:10,239
and this the government operations

3147
02:12:10,239 --> 02:12:11,840
center will produce a lesson learned

3148
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:13,599
report and so all these different

3149
02:12:13,599 --> 02:12:16,480
stakeholders they uh have been entrusted

3150
02:12:16,480 --> 02:12:18,719
with the responsibility where they will

3151
02:12:18,719 --> 02:12:21,280
be coming up with the let's say lessons

3152
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:23,840
learned and accordingly they will be

3153
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:26,560
let's say uh submitting it to uh

3154
02:12:26,560 --> 02:12:29,440
where they need to submit that okay

3155
02:12:29,440 --> 02:12:31,840
now if i take an example so if we are

3156
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:33,599
having the national cyber security

3157
02:12:33,599 --> 02:12:35,920
committee so the lessons learned should

3158
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:37,679
also be sent to that national cyber

3159
02:12:37,679 --> 02:12:40,239
security committee to see that

3160
02:12:40,239 --> 02:12:42,639
what was the

3161
02:12:42,639 --> 02:12:45,920
cause of the incident and then

3162
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:47,679
how it has happened so everything is

3163
02:12:47,679 --> 02:12:50,000
stipulated now based on to that they

3164
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,239
could also sit and see that what kind of

3165
02:12:52,239 --> 02:12:54,320
improvement so recommendations also

3166
02:12:54,320 --> 02:12:56,000
could get into the post incident

3167
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,480
activity after discussing it with that

3168
02:12:58,480 --> 02:13:00,159
kind of a committee and this is where

3169
02:13:00,159 --> 02:13:02,800
you start improving onto your different

3170
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:05,280
policies or security let's say policies

3171
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:08,400
you have in place okay

3172
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:10,000
so uh

3173
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,320
let me move on

3174
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:15,599
uh that's something

3175
02:13:15,599 --> 02:13:19,199
finishes the part of how uh do we uh

3176
02:13:19,199 --> 02:13:23,920
design uh the the the uh plan

3177
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:24,719
uh

3178
02:13:24,719 --> 02:13:27,520
so what i'll do is here is that maybe um

3179
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:29,280
i will uh

3180
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:30,719
anyway

3181
02:13:30,719 --> 02:13:32,639
open it up because we have been talking

3182
02:13:32,639 --> 02:13:35,119
for nearly uh

3183
02:13:35,119 --> 02:13:36,960
more than an hour or so

3184
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:38,159
uh

3185
02:13:38,159 --> 02:13:41,199
so if if there are let me open the floor

3186
02:13:41,199 --> 02:13:43,440
uh can i see the

3187
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:46,719
uh questions

3188
02:13:49,280 --> 02:13:50,719
okay

3189
02:13:50,719 --> 02:13:51,840
so

3190
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:54,159
i can stop sharing i can see some

3191
02:13:54,159 --> 02:13:56,079
questions there are two questions like

3192
02:13:56,079 --> 02:13:57,280
here

3193
02:13:57,280 --> 02:13:59,840
uh yeah they were the same same two

3194
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:01,280
questions

3195
02:14:01,280 --> 02:14:04,239
so any anyone wants to to

3196
02:14:04,239 --> 02:14:06,400
ask questions now because

3197
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:08,239
we can open the floor

3198
02:14:08,239 --> 02:14:11,799
any anybody

3199
02:14:24,400 --> 02:14:28,480
anyone has uh any questions

3200
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:31,280
so maybe maybe we can keep it uh

3201
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:32,719
interactive we can

3202
02:14:32,719 --> 02:14:34,000
talk to

3203
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:35,920
each other because

3204
02:14:35,920 --> 02:14:36,800
uh

3205
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:37,679
uh

3206
02:14:37,679 --> 02:14:39,679
we understand and we hope that you are

3207
02:14:39,679 --> 02:14:42,079
understanding what we are talking about

3208
02:14:42,079 --> 02:14:44,480
uh but i think it is good if you have

3209
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:45,760
any questions

3210
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:47,840
uh please raise your hands

3211
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:50,320
and then maybe we can discuss so if you

3212
02:14:50,320 --> 02:14:52,400
ask questions then maybe i can

3213
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:56,239
explain you uh much more uh

3214
02:14:56,239 --> 02:14:58,800
beyond the slides uh how it happened but

3215
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:01,920
anyway uh i'm going to talk about

3216
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:02,960
that

3217
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:05,360
one a good example

3218
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:06,840
that how it has been

3219
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:08,960
implemented and and then how it takes a

3220
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:10,480
ship

3221
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:12,718
okay

3222
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:20,400
so any any any any

3223
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:21,520
questions

3224
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:22,960
uh but i don't see any questions

3225
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:24,560
referral

3226
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:27,920
anyone wants to ask anything

3227
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:32,159
okay

3228
02:15:33,679 --> 02:15:34,480
so

3229
02:15:34,480 --> 02:15:36,560
if if there are no questions

3230
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:39,040
so then maybe in that case what we can

3231
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:40,400
do is that we can break quickly for

3232
02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:42,239
another five minutes

3233
02:15:42,239 --> 02:15:43,199
uh

3234
02:15:43,199 --> 02:15:44,239
and then

3235
02:15:44,239 --> 02:15:46,000
we can take up the last part of let's

3236
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:47,360
say discussion

3237
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:50,000
of let's say testing implementation and

3238
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
monitoring of the plan so and that could

3239
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,079
be a discussion of another half an hour

3240
02:15:54,079 --> 02:15:55,119
or so

3241
02:15:55,119 --> 02:15:56,639
and then

3242
02:15:56,639 --> 02:15:59,520
we can discuss that and give an example

3243
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:02,400
and we can take up the questions and

3244
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:05,840
after that maybe we can uh close um the

3245
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:08,560
session for for for this training

3246
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:10,800
okay

3247
02:16:15,920 --> 02:16:16,960
all right

3248
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:20,239
so if there are no questions

3249
02:16:20,239 --> 02:16:23,040
uh we take a break so it's nearly

3250
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:25,280
um

3251
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:27,679
around uh

3252
02:16:27,679 --> 02:16:29,679
if if i

3253
02:16:29,679 --> 02:16:31,119
uh

3254
02:16:31,119 --> 02:16:33,200
something like emiratius

3255
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:34,398
uh

3256
02:16:34,398 --> 02:16:35,920
uh 5

3257
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:38,318
35

3258
02:16:38,318 --> 02:16:40,879
so in five minutes from now uh will be

3259
02:16:40,879 --> 02:16:43,598
will will be back

3260
02:16:45,679 --> 02:16:49,478
so see you in five minutes

3261
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:54,960
so then guys

3262
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:56,080
welcome back

3263
02:22:56,080 --> 02:22:57,520
uh

3264
02:22:57,520 --> 02:22:59,920
i hope you had some time to just let's

3265
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:00,720
say

3266
02:23:00,720 --> 02:23:03,200
uh stretch your legs a little bit

3267
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:05,200
and and then and grab some at your

3268
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:07,600
coffee

3269
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:09,600
so now i think that this is the last

3270
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:10,560
part of

3271
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:11,840
the discussion

3272
02:23:11,840 --> 02:23:14,160
of this training program

3273
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:17,120
where we will be uh talking about

3274
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:19,280
the testing implementation

3275
02:23:19,280 --> 02:23:21,040
and and monitoring of let's say the

3276
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:24,080
national cyber crisis management plan so

3277
02:23:24,080 --> 02:23:26,960
but before uh we go again uh i'd like to

3278
02:23:26,960 --> 02:23:29,760
open the four ones again if you have any

3279
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:33,200
questions somebody in mind where

3280
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:35,200
you have been

3281
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:36,800
had some reflection

3282
02:23:36,800 --> 02:23:38,479
to ask

3283
02:23:38,479 --> 02:23:40,319
then we can take it up

3284
02:23:40,319 --> 02:23:41,120
now

3285
02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:42,960
or even at the end of the session that's

3286
02:23:42,960 --> 02:23:46,279
also a possibility

3287
02:23:49,359 --> 02:23:50,160
okay

3288
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:52,240
so it looks like again that and there

3289
02:23:52,240 --> 02:23:54,240
are no questions

3290
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:56,560
so if there are no questions so i can i

3291
02:23:56,560 --> 02:23:58,000
can

3292
02:23:58,000 --> 02:23:59,120
start with

3293
02:23:59,120 --> 02:24:01,200
this discussion

3294
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:03,520
where

3295
02:24:04,240 --> 02:24:06,320
we can talk about

3296
02:24:06,320 --> 02:24:07,520
[Music]

3297
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:10,240
the implementation part of it

3298
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:11,840
okay implementation testing and

3299
02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:13,760
maintaining the plan

3300
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:17,200
so now it's a very clear thing

3301
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:19,680
you know you know

3302
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:21,040
that any

3303
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:24,720
national cyber crisis management plan

3304
02:24:24,720 --> 02:24:27,040
how

3305
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:28,640
it is written

3306
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:30,399
this is one

3307
02:24:30,399 --> 02:24:32,240
secondly also

3308
02:24:32,240 --> 02:24:33,760
how

3309
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:36,800
what contains uh what elements

3310
02:24:36,800 --> 02:24:38,720
you should have

3311
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:39,600
okay

3312
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:42,880
uh that's that's the second thing

3313
02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:44,560
and the third thing is the

3314
02:24:44,560 --> 02:24:46,800
implementation okay

3315
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:50,640
so for for the implementation

3316
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:52,640
uh

3317
02:24:52,640 --> 02:24:55,200
what is normally required here is if i

3318
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:57,280
show you this later slide

3319
02:24:57,280 --> 02:24:59,120
so a setting of up of the governance

3320
02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:01,359
committee so after the national cyber

3321
02:25:01,359 --> 02:25:03,040
crisis management plan has been

3322
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:04,080
developed

3323
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:06,560
and approved by the government uh its

3324
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:08,640
implementation and execution starts so

3325
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:10,000
that's the part and that's one thing

3326
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:11,520
what we're trying to say

3327
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:13,920
it consists of the following steps

3328
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:14,640
and

3329
02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:16,399
most of it

3330
02:25:16,399 --> 02:25:18,560
we

3331
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:21,200
have discussed initially but i think uh

3332
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:24,800
here we'll be elaborating much more so

3333
02:25:24,800 --> 02:25:26,000
that you

3334
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:27,600
understand

3335
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:30,399
how it can be done so first of all

3336
02:25:30,399 --> 02:25:32,880
now already we know that what governance

3337
02:25:32,880 --> 02:25:35,200
committee does

3338
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:37,439
so for the implementation

3339
02:25:37,439 --> 02:25:39,359
there are two things

3340
02:25:39,359 --> 02:25:42,560
the first thing is that if you

3341
02:25:42,560 --> 02:25:43,840
do not

3342
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:46,399
have that governance committee

3343
02:25:46,399 --> 02:25:49,280
so and if it forms a part of your

3344
02:25:49,280 --> 02:25:52,399
national cyber crisis management plan

3345
02:25:52,399 --> 02:25:55,280
then you need to set it up

3346
02:25:55,280 --> 02:25:56,319
or

3347
02:25:56,319 --> 02:25:58,399
if there is already a national level

3348
02:25:58,399 --> 02:26:00,880
governance committee which looks after

3349
02:26:00,880 --> 02:26:02,319
the issues of

3350
02:26:02,319 --> 02:26:04,080
cyber securities have a crime or

3351
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:05,359
coordination

3352
02:26:05,359 --> 02:26:06,560
then

3353
02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:08,720
maybe that committee itself

3354
02:26:08,720 --> 02:26:10,640
can assume the role

3355
02:26:10,640 --> 02:26:13,760
of let's say coordinating the national

3356
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:16,560
cyber crisis management plan so it's

3357
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:18,800
either way

3358
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:21,200
it can be done

3359
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:23,439
so that's that's the first thing

3360
02:26:23,439 --> 02:26:26,000
and that committee what will be their

3361
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:29,439
role is to overseeing the execution of

3362
02:26:29,439 --> 02:26:33,120
that national cyber crisis management

3363
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:35,840
plan and facilitating monitoring control

3364
02:26:35,840 --> 02:26:38,080
and transmission of decisions so that

3365
02:26:38,080 --> 02:26:40,240
does

3366
02:26:40,240 --> 02:26:41,439
what basically

3367
02:26:41,439 --> 02:26:44,560
this committee i should do facilitation

3368
02:26:44,560 --> 02:26:47,520
of facility uh facilitation control and

3369
02:26:47,520 --> 02:26:48,720
transmission

3370
02:26:48,720 --> 02:26:50,479
of decisions

3371
02:26:50,479 --> 02:26:52,720
now second thing what

3372
02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:54,880
has to be done

3373
02:26:54,880 --> 02:26:56,399
is the formation of incident

3374
02:26:56,399 --> 02:26:59,519
coordination and communication

3375
02:27:00,160 --> 02:27:03,920
you need to say that all stakeholders

3376
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:06,880
who are form part of this this is one

3377
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:09,359
but again at the same time now we need

3378
02:27:09,359 --> 02:27:11,840
to uh look at that

3379
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:13,359
in the incident coordination it means

3380
02:27:13,359 --> 02:27:15,439
the incident response

3381
02:27:15,439 --> 02:27:17,359
so you can also call it as instant

3382
02:27:17,359 --> 02:27:19,840
response

3383
02:27:20,479 --> 02:27:22,319
so that that needs to be set up from

3384
02:27:22,319 --> 02:27:24,800
different stakeholders so now

3385
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:26,319
it's good for you to know that who

3386
02:27:26,319 --> 02:27:28,000
should be part of it

3387
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:29,920
there can be a person from the national

3388
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:32,640
sir there can be a person from the uh

3389
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:35,120
incident uh sorry internet service

3390
02:27:35,120 --> 02:27:37,840
providers isps they can be a person from

3391
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:40,160
law enforcement

3392
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:41,359
so because

3393
02:27:41,359 --> 02:27:44,399
that this triangle is always required

3394
02:27:44,399 --> 02:27:46,880
for any incident resolution

3395
02:27:46,880 --> 02:27:48,319
at the country level

3396
02:27:48,319 --> 02:27:50,240
or even let's say at the

3397
02:27:50,240 --> 02:27:53,120
let's say if country wants to escalate

3398
02:27:53,120 --> 02:27:56,319
that incident to any other level

3399
02:27:56,800 --> 02:27:58,560
and communication team

3400
02:27:58,560 --> 02:28:01,120
so i previously i mean i have been

3401
02:28:01,120 --> 02:28:04,240
talking about the designing of let's say

3402
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:06,960
that uh plan so we discuss about a

3403
02:28:06,960 --> 02:28:08,720
little bit of communication team so

3404
02:28:08,720 --> 02:28:11,359
communication teams role here is of to

3405
02:28:11,359 --> 02:28:12,560
fully

3406
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:14,080
address

3407
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:16,240
and pass on the information to different

3408
02:28:16,240 --> 02:28:17,600
people

3409
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:19,359
and not different people but let's say

3410
02:28:19,359 --> 02:28:21,600
to people in

3411
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:24,160
to the public or to the citizens

3412
02:28:24,160 --> 02:28:25,600
that

3413
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:27,760
what is the situation like

3414
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:29,920
so communication team one communication

3415
02:28:29,920 --> 02:28:32,399
team within the uh let's say a

3416
02:28:32,399 --> 02:28:34,399
coordination team and one communication

3417
02:28:34,399 --> 02:28:36,800
team especially that's more like a pr

3418
02:28:36,800 --> 02:28:38,399
team

3419
02:28:38,399 --> 02:28:40,880
which uh let's say deals with the issues

3420
02:28:40,880 --> 02:28:43,760
uh which is the issues with the public

3421
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:46,000
okay

3422
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:47,760
that's that's the second thing

3423
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:50,000
now the the third thing uh third thing

3424
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,800
here is that a venue for holding

3425
02:28:52,800 --> 02:28:56,160
meetings during a cyber crisis

3426
02:28:56,160 --> 02:28:57,359
okay

3427
02:28:57,359 --> 02:29:00,560
so venue for holding meetings during a

3428
02:29:00,560 --> 02:29:04,000
cyber crisis so this also should be a

3429
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,640
clearly

3430
02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:07,840
mentioned

3431
02:29:07,840 --> 02:29:11,920
into let's say the the plan that where

3432
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:13,920
you are going to hold meetings

3433
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:16,640
everything is set

3434
02:29:16,720 --> 02:29:18,399
nothing is like

3435
02:29:18,399 --> 02:29:20,800
when something

3436
02:29:20,800 --> 02:29:23,200
strikes or strucks then we see a where

3437
02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:25,600
we are going to meet no

3438
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:28,319
so that's why this is a structured

3439
02:29:28,319 --> 02:29:31,040
approach of incident resolution that's

3440
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:32,319
why we need this plan otherwise that's

3441
02:29:32,319 --> 02:29:33,920
not required

3442
02:29:33,920 --> 02:29:36,319
so once emergency is there nobody has

3443
02:29:36,319 --> 02:29:38,880
time to think

3444
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:41,760
so once you do not have time to think

3445
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:43,600
then you will not be able to coordinate

3446
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:45,760
in that situation

3447
02:29:45,760 --> 02:29:48,080
so in order to coordinate properly what

3448
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:52,240
is required is that you have

3449
02:29:52,479 --> 02:29:53,439
the

3450
02:29:53,439 --> 02:29:54,720
procedures

3451
02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:57,040
and the plans and the teams

3452
02:29:57,040 --> 02:29:59,520
and the governance committee all set

3453
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:02,560
defined structured

3454
02:30:02,560 --> 02:30:05,840
documented so that we know that uh where

3455
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:08,160
to go home to call and when to call and

3456
02:30:08,160 --> 02:30:10,000
from where to go

3457
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,640
and then also the regular review of the

3458
02:30:12,640 --> 02:30:13,920
plan so i'll be talking a little bit

3459
02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:16,560
later that how can you review that okay

3460
02:30:16,560 --> 02:30:19,520
so that's what

3461
02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:22,560
the implementation uh and execution

3462
02:30:22,560 --> 02:30:24,160
let's say starts

3463
02:30:24,160 --> 02:30:25,680
this way okay

3464
02:30:25,680 --> 02:30:27,760
and these are the steps for the

3465
02:30:27,760 --> 02:30:30,160
implementation and execution of let's

3466
02:30:30,160 --> 02:30:32,160
say this plan whatever we are talking

3467
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:34,399
about

3468
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:38,800
and uh now the uh testing the national

3469
02:30:38,800 --> 02:30:41,359
cyber crisis management plan this is

3470
02:30:41,359 --> 02:30:44,000
another good step which i think we all

3471
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:45,439
should be understanding

3472
02:30:45,439 --> 02:30:47,439
after the implementation process the

3473
02:30:47,439 --> 02:30:50,080
next step is to test the plan how do you

3474
02:30:50,080 --> 02:30:52,080
test

3475
02:30:52,080 --> 02:30:54,800
how effective is your plan

3476
02:30:54,800 --> 02:30:57,840
this is what we need to see

3477
02:30:58,640 --> 02:31:00,720
and and then for testing there are

3478
02:31:00,720 --> 02:31:03,600
different things for testing you need to

3479
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:05,680
have some sort of a

3480
02:31:05,680 --> 02:31:07,760
simulation exercise you can have some

3481
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:10,399
sort of let's say uh

3482
02:31:10,399 --> 02:31:12,479
the the

3483
02:31:12,479 --> 02:31:13,439
drills

3484
02:31:13,439 --> 02:31:15,520
uh which we can

3485
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:17,359
have with the

3486
02:31:17,359 --> 02:31:20,800
stakeholders and then the community

3487
02:31:20,800 --> 02:31:23,439
so that you know that how effective your

3488
02:31:23,439 --> 02:31:26,080
plan is working

3489
02:31:26,080 --> 02:31:27,439
so

3490
02:31:27,439 --> 02:31:28,399
for example

3491
02:31:28,399 --> 02:31:32,000
uh in in mauritius uh when we have been

3492
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:35,280
testing so we we have tested with the

3493
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:38,080
let's say the government sector

3494
02:31:38,080 --> 02:31:39,760
so even um

3495
02:31:39,760 --> 02:31:42,240
according to the scenarios we can always

3496
02:31:42,240 --> 02:31:43,439
do that

3497
02:31:43,439 --> 02:31:46,160
and that scenario was like

3498
02:31:46,160 --> 02:31:47,600
everybody's

3499
02:31:47,600 --> 02:31:49,760
salary payday so it was much more like

3500
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:52,319
scenario like that so most of the people

3501
02:31:52,319 --> 02:31:54,960
they get their salaries around 26 27

3502
02:31:54,960 --> 02:31:58,080
27th of the month and between 27 to

3503
02:31:58,080 --> 02:32:00,479
let's say 30th of the month and and then

3504
02:32:00,479 --> 02:32:02,479
what happens that if during this time

3505
02:32:02,479 --> 02:32:04,080
and there's an attack on to all the

3506
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:06,000
commercial banks so let's say

3507
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:07,600
major

3508
02:32:07,600 --> 02:32:08,960
system of the

3509
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:10,640
commercial bank

3510
02:32:10,640 --> 02:32:13,840
which serves let's say most of the uh

3511
02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:16,560
people in the country and then um

3512
02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:19,600
how to manage that

3513
02:32:20,160 --> 02:32:22,720
plus um maybe we can have uh some sort

3514
02:32:22,720 --> 02:32:25,200
of uh um

3515
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:28,000
simulation for our critical systems like

3516
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,640
scada systems of uh

3517
02:32:30,640 --> 02:32:31,920
different uh

3518
02:32:31,920 --> 02:32:33,200
sectors

3519
02:32:33,200 --> 02:32:36,720
especially for electrical um grids and

3520
02:32:36,720 --> 02:32:38,399
and

3521
02:32:38,399 --> 02:32:42,160
scale assistant for water supply

3522
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:44,800
so this testing the plan ill two

3523
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:47,120
important results if you see a clear

3524
02:32:47,120 --> 02:32:48,720
understanding of whether your plan is

3525
02:32:48,720 --> 02:32:50,880
likely to work and identification of the

3526
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:52,319
gaps in the plan and address them

3527
02:32:52,319 --> 02:32:53,760
accordingly so

3528
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:56,240
like cyber rules which which are done

3529
02:32:56,240 --> 02:32:58,479
similar kind of thing or any any plane

3530
02:32:58,479 --> 02:33:00,720
rule which we carry out for fire drill

3531
02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:02,640
uh if you see firewall is carried out we

3532
02:33:02,640 --> 02:33:04,640
know why to straight out just to look at

3533
02:33:04,640 --> 02:33:05,359
the

3534
02:33:05,359 --> 02:33:06,640
how

3535
02:33:06,640 --> 02:33:10,399
effectively our processes are working

3536
02:33:10,399 --> 02:33:11,280
when

3537
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:13,920
we are conducting that rule so if in

3538
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:16,880
case a fire erupts then we know that yes

3539
02:33:16,880 --> 02:33:18,240
it is working

3540
02:33:18,240 --> 02:33:19,120
so

3541
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:21,280
same same uh concept i think you all

3542
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:23,600
know um maybe i don't have celebrate

3543
02:33:23,600 --> 02:33:26,160
more than that uh you have an idea of

3544
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:28,240
what i'm talking about now

3545
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:29,040
uh

3546
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:31,200
it's it's like uh that's another

3547
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:33,359
rational for testing a national cyber

3548
02:33:33,359 --> 02:33:36,720
crisis management plan so i think it's a

3549
02:33:36,720 --> 02:33:39,280
typo for twice a hour in the cyber sorry

3550
02:33:39,280 --> 02:33:42,319
for that uh to assess the ability of

3551
02:33:42,319 --> 02:33:44,640
nations to coordinate response to cyber

3552
02:33:44,640 --> 02:33:46,319
emergency situations i think i've

3553
02:33:46,319 --> 02:33:49,439
already said this so uh this slide uh

3554
02:33:49,439 --> 02:33:51,600
gives you more

3555
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:54,160
let's say understanding

3556
02:33:54,160 --> 02:33:56,560
uh what happens uh into testing to

3557
02:33:56,560 --> 02:33:58,399
assess the ability of the governing body

3558
02:33:58,399 --> 02:34:00,319
committee responsible for national

3559
02:34:00,319 --> 02:34:02,479
incident response as a leading authority

3560
02:34:02,479 --> 02:34:03,760
that's also

3561
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:05,840
we can do that to assess the impact of a

3562
02:34:05,840 --> 02:34:08,000
serious cyber or critical

3563
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,319
situation affecting a country so i gave

3564
02:34:10,319 --> 02:34:13,040
the example of fiscal systems to test a

3565
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:15,359
tasking and guidance needed to resolve a

3566
02:34:15,359 --> 02:34:17,280
cyber incidence

3567
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:19,040
okay

3568
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:21,120
and and then also to assist strategic

3569
02:34:21,120 --> 02:34:22,880
information sharing and and

3570
02:34:22,880 --> 02:34:25,280
communication with internal and and

3571
02:34:25,280 --> 02:34:27,760
external stakeholders uh partners and

3572
02:34:27,760 --> 02:34:29,840
and and other

3573
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:31,680
and finding gaps in the plan and improve

3574
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:33,200
incident resolution so

3575
02:34:33,200 --> 02:34:36,479
i think uh we discussed uh we uh you

3576
02:34:36,479 --> 02:34:39,200
have understanding now uh but let's say

3577
02:34:39,200 --> 02:34:40,080
uh

3578
02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:41,920
if you see

3579
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:44,399
the rationale for testing

3580
02:34:44,399 --> 02:34:45,200
of

3581
02:34:45,200 --> 02:34:47,760
this particular plan is in these lines

3582
02:34:47,760 --> 02:34:49,920
okay

3583
02:34:49,920 --> 02:34:53,200
so if i need to move on um

3584
02:34:53,200 --> 02:34:54,880
this i think already

3585
02:34:54,880 --> 02:34:56,319
we discussed how to test the national

3586
02:34:56,319 --> 02:34:58,800
cyber crisis and plan i said that

3587
02:34:58,800 --> 02:35:01,280
through services exercises uh could be

3588
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:02,960
of let's say table top exercises for the

3589
02:35:02,960 --> 02:35:04,399
top management

3590
02:35:04,399 --> 02:35:06,319
and top management means here we can

3591
02:35:06,319 --> 02:35:07,840
have the category of the

3592
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:10,399
national cyber security committee

3593
02:35:10,399 --> 02:35:13,680
plus that committee could invite

3594
02:35:13,680 --> 02:35:16,319
other uh extended members and those

3595
02:35:16,319 --> 02:35:18,319
extended members and they could let's

3596
02:35:18,319 --> 02:35:20,880
say a form part of it and once they uh

3597
02:35:20,880 --> 02:35:23,359
form part of it um then that kind of

3598
02:35:23,359 --> 02:35:24,560
exercise could happen with them to

3599
02:35:24,560 --> 02:35:26,319
understand that

3600
02:35:26,319 --> 02:35:27,520
because

3601
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:29,120
why for the top management because they

3602
02:35:29,120 --> 02:35:31,760
they make decisions and

3603
02:35:31,760 --> 02:35:34,319
in this situation

3604
02:35:34,319 --> 02:35:36,960
decision is important and once decision

3605
02:35:36,960 --> 02:35:39,040
decision is important

3606
02:35:39,040 --> 02:35:42,479
they should be uh let's say knowing

3607
02:35:42,479 --> 02:35:43,920
for different let's say types of

3608
02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:47,520
incident what decisions to make

3609
02:35:48,479 --> 02:35:49,680
that's just

3610
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:50,399
one

3611
02:35:50,399 --> 02:35:53,040
good example like even we all know that

3612
02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:55,520
in this covet uh let's say

3613
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:57,439
era

3614
02:35:57,439 --> 02:36:00,720
every country has a a let's say

3615
02:36:00,720 --> 02:36:02,399
a top-level committee

3616
02:36:02,399 --> 02:36:03,280
which

3617
02:36:03,280 --> 02:36:06,800
deals with the uh whole coordination of

3618
02:36:06,800 --> 02:36:10,800
uh the situation uh uh evolves um for uh

3619
02:36:10,800 --> 02:36:13,680
let's say uh covered uh cases go with

3620
02:36:13,680 --> 02:36:16,160
vaccination so all everything is done

3621
02:36:16,160 --> 02:36:18,080
through so i mean it's a top level um

3622
02:36:18,080 --> 02:36:20,160
top notch committee in every country

3623
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:21,840
every country has that so similar kind

3624
02:36:21,840 --> 02:36:24,160
of a thing

3625
02:36:24,160 --> 02:36:25,920
now even in covet

3626
02:36:25,920 --> 02:36:27,359
that's not connecting with the subject

3627
02:36:27,359 --> 02:36:30,880
here but i think you all know in covet

3628
02:36:30,880 --> 02:36:32,240
since

3629
02:36:32,240 --> 02:36:34,960
people are working remotely

3630
02:36:34,960 --> 02:36:37,840
now though even uh threats they have

3631
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:40,319
increased to few folds

3632
02:36:40,319 --> 02:36:43,119
in every country

3633
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:44,399
so

3634
02:36:44,399 --> 02:36:46,960
this is one of the

3635
02:36:46,960 --> 02:36:48,240
let's say

3636
02:36:48,240 --> 02:36:52,080
in a way scenario i could say uh fits in

3637
02:36:52,080 --> 02:36:53,600
uh for our

3638
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:55,439
testing technical exercise is also

3639
02:36:55,439 --> 02:36:57,439
important because this is important for

3640
02:36:57,439 --> 02:36:59,359
the technical team uh incident response

3641
02:36:59,359 --> 02:37:01,280
or coordination team which is working on

3642
02:37:01,280 --> 02:37:03,280
to that so another effective way to test

3643
02:37:03,280 --> 02:37:05,200
the incident response plan is to

3644
02:37:05,200 --> 02:37:07,520
simulate a real attack to see how

3645
02:37:07,520 --> 02:37:08,880
stakeholders

3646
02:37:08,880 --> 02:37:11,760
of the plan will be will will respond

3647
02:37:11,760 --> 02:37:13,600
and these tests not only

3648
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:15,760
evaluate what incident coordination team

3649
02:37:15,760 --> 02:37:16,800
would do

3650
02:37:16,800 --> 02:37:18,800
when faced up against a major incident

3651
02:37:18,800 --> 02:37:20,080
but how they

3652
02:37:20,080 --> 02:37:22,000
could do it so

3653
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:22,800
that's

3654
02:37:22,800 --> 02:37:25,120
uh you understand what i'm trying to say

3655
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:26,560
and that what

3656
02:37:26,560 --> 02:37:28,560
technical exercises normally do

3657
02:37:28,560 --> 02:37:30,640
different things they also

3658
02:37:30,640 --> 02:37:33,520
let's say test your preparedness how

3659
02:37:33,520 --> 02:37:35,359
let's say the best

3660
02:37:35,359 --> 02:37:38,000
team is prepared to respond to an

3661
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:39,840
incident

3662
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:42,399
so that's another

3663
02:37:42,399 --> 02:37:45,359
capacity you'll be able to test with the

3664
02:37:45,359 --> 02:37:47,680
technical exercises and which very much

3665
02:37:47,680 --> 02:37:50,640
forms the part of the

3666
02:37:50,640 --> 02:37:53,600
testing of national cyber crisis

3667
02:37:53,600 --> 02:37:56,000
management plan okay

3668
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:59,120
so i move on uh to the

3669
02:37:59,120 --> 02:38:02,080
uh execution again i think this is we're

3670
02:38:02,080 --> 02:38:04,800
continuing here uh so execution of a

3671
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:08,240
national cyber crisis management plan uh

3672
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:10,240
consists of the steps the nation will

3673
02:38:10,240 --> 02:38:13,040
take when an incident so i think uh

3674
02:38:13,040 --> 02:38:14,880
we have already said this national

3675
02:38:14,880 --> 02:38:17,040
significance has been detected

3676
02:38:17,040 --> 02:38:19,280
this phase activates the

3677
02:38:19,280 --> 02:38:21,200
national

3678
02:38:21,200 --> 02:38:24,240
cyber uh incident response plan uh and

3679
02:38:24,240 --> 02:38:26,479
involves uh invoking all the majors

3680
02:38:26,479 --> 02:38:27,920
listed

3681
02:38:27,920 --> 02:38:29,520
in the plan so

3682
02:38:29,520 --> 02:38:31,600
that happens

3683
02:38:31,600 --> 02:38:33,200
so

3684
02:38:33,200 --> 02:38:34,640
i move on

3685
02:38:34,640 --> 02:38:37,120
uh here if you see the execution of the

3686
02:38:37,120 --> 02:38:39,359
national cyber incident response plan

3687
02:38:39,359 --> 02:38:41,520
the same way as i said so we defined

3688
02:38:41,520 --> 02:38:43,040
there so if you look at the previous

3689
02:38:43,040 --> 02:38:43,920
document

3690
02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:45,920
so this is the execution of national

3691
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:47,600
cyber incident response plan during a

3692
02:38:47,600 --> 02:38:49,840
subject crisis so level one level two

3693
02:38:49,840 --> 02:38:52,080
level three and level four so these are

3694
02:38:52,080 --> 02:38:56,080
all escalation and response levels

3695
02:38:56,080 --> 02:38:58,640
so in level one uh we talked about are

3696
02:38:58,640 --> 02:39:00,960
the following conditions met uh threats

3697
02:39:00,960 --> 02:39:04,960
and vulnerabilities uh incidents

3698
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:08,840
and and then indicators uh or broader

3699
02:39:08,840 --> 02:39:10,720
propagation

3700
02:39:10,720 --> 02:39:12,960
so there are uh

3701
02:39:12,960 --> 02:39:15,439
assessments and that's where we need to

3702
02:39:15,439 --> 02:39:17,120
do the analysis

3703
02:39:17,120 --> 02:39:20,640
so once we analyze and we see that

3704
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:22,479
this is a threat and that's a critical

3705
02:39:22,479 --> 02:39:25,840
threat and it needs to be mitigated

3706
02:39:25,840 --> 02:39:27,600
now

3707
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:30,000
if let's say

3708
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,319
we need to move further

3709
02:39:32,319 --> 02:39:34,319
and and that requires

3710
02:39:34,319 --> 02:39:36,000
further let's say

3711
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:37,520
involvement of different teams and

3712
02:39:37,520 --> 02:39:39,359
different

3713
02:39:39,359 --> 02:39:42,399
other people from the committee then it

3714
02:39:42,399 --> 02:39:44,479
goes to the next level are the following

3715
02:39:44,479 --> 02:39:45,760
conditions met threats and

3716
02:39:45,760 --> 02:39:47,840
vulnerabilities uh imminent threat of

3717
02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:49,600
high plus impact to one or more

3718
02:39:49,600 --> 02:39:52,080
departments high exposure so this is

3719
02:39:52,080 --> 02:39:53,600
where once we have been doing the

3720
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:56,240
classification so and the uh let's say

3721
02:39:56,240 --> 02:39:59,280
as uh priority and the severity so we're

3722
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:00,960
analyzing

3723
02:40:00,960 --> 02:40:03,359
so after the analysis the more critical

3724
02:40:03,359 --> 02:40:06,000
it is we just keep on moving unless or

3725
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,560
until we are not able to let's say

3726
02:40:08,560 --> 02:40:11,280
resolve or contain it contain and

3727
02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:13,840
resolve it

3728
02:40:14,479 --> 02:40:16,080
so are the following now if you look at

3729
02:40:16,080 --> 02:40:17,760
the level three are the following

3730
02:40:17,760 --> 02:40:19,200
conditions met

3731
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:21,520
so threats uh not applicable compromise

3732
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:23,520
affecting delivery of many mission

3733
02:40:23,520 --> 02:40:25,279
critical program services resulting in

3734
02:40:25,279 --> 02:40:28,880
severe injury wide spread propagation so

3735
02:40:28,880 --> 02:40:31,200
now here again so yes escalator level

3736
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:33,600
four so federal emergency response plan

3737
02:40:33,600 --> 02:40:35,600
so that's uh

3738
02:40:35,600 --> 02:40:37,520
government of canada dm and cabinet

3739
02:40:37,520 --> 02:40:39,359
committee so i think these are different

3740
02:40:39,359 --> 02:40:40,720
committees where

3741
02:40:40,720 --> 02:40:42,399
let's say uh

3742
02:40:42,399 --> 02:40:43,680
which is connected to the federal

3743
02:40:43,680 --> 02:40:45,600
emergency response plan

3744
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:48,080
and they they look at that and it's much

3745
02:40:48,080 --> 02:40:49,600
more like a national cyber security

3746
02:40:49,600 --> 02:40:50,720
committee what we have been talking

3747
02:40:50,720 --> 02:40:52,880
about

3748
02:40:53,920 --> 02:40:56,720
so uh that that's that's that's how

3749
02:40:56,720 --> 02:41:01,439
uh it it it goes on uh and and and

3750
02:41:01,439 --> 02:41:04,800
that's how it moves okay

3751
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:08,800
so uh that that's the example uh here uh

3752
02:41:08,800 --> 02:41:10,080
and and

3753
02:41:10,080 --> 02:41:12,240
uh i i move on

3754
02:41:12,240 --> 02:41:15,439
uh to the next uh slide here review and

3755
02:41:15,439 --> 02:41:18,080
maintenance of a national cyber

3756
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:20,479
crisis management plan so

3757
02:41:20,479 --> 02:41:22,160
this one is much more like for effective

3758
02:41:22,160 --> 02:41:23,680
incident response

3759
02:41:23,680 --> 02:41:26,399
at national level

3760
02:41:26,399 --> 02:41:27,279
uh

3761
02:41:27,279 --> 02:41:29,120
national cyber crisis management plan

3762
02:41:29,120 --> 02:41:30,640
should be reviewed and updated clearly

3763
02:41:30,640 --> 02:41:31,760
so

3764
02:41:31,760 --> 02:41:35,279
that's something we discussed before

3765
02:41:35,279 --> 02:41:37,359
and you understand it now

3766
02:41:37,359 --> 02:41:39,040
uh the revision process includes

3767
02:41:39,040 --> 02:41:40,560
developing or updating any process

3768
02:41:40,560 --> 02:41:41,920
pertaining to the incident response

3769
02:41:41,920 --> 02:41:43,680
capabilities which can affect the plan

3770
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:44,800
okay

3771
02:41:44,800 --> 02:41:46,479
uh any significant upgrade should be

3772
02:41:46,479 --> 02:41:48,240
vetted by stakeholders for the governing

3773
02:41:48,240 --> 02:41:50,880
body or committees responsible for uh

3774
02:41:50,880 --> 02:41:52,399
ncmp so

3775
02:41:52,399 --> 02:41:55,200
national uh cyber crisis management plan

3776
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:56,560
so

3777
02:41:56,560 --> 02:41:59,040
that's the uh

3778
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:01,439
normally is done in every

3779
02:42:01,439 --> 02:42:02,160
uh

3780
02:42:02,160 --> 02:42:04,160
how to say plan because if there is a

3781
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:07,520
change um that change is uh has to be

3782
02:42:07,520 --> 02:42:11,520
wetted and once let's say it is fully

3783
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:12,479
agreed

3784
02:42:12,479 --> 02:42:16,000
then it is integrated so

3785
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,240
that's how it works the review process

3786
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:20,000
so

3787
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:21,120
something

3788
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:22,880
which is uh

3789
02:42:22,880 --> 02:42:24,800
important for us to do but it's good

3790
02:42:24,800 --> 02:42:26,399
that once we do

3791
02:42:26,399 --> 02:42:28,640
then normally we'll be able to learn

3792
02:42:28,640 --> 02:42:30,960
better

3793
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:32,080
um

3794
02:42:32,080 --> 02:42:32,960
so

3795
02:42:32,960 --> 02:42:35,359
why we have to review and maintain of

3796
02:42:35,359 --> 02:42:37,600
the national subway uh crisis management

3797
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:39,600
plan of course it's a long list but the

3798
02:42:39,600 --> 02:42:41,200
gist here is

3799
02:42:41,200 --> 02:42:43,680
we need to review and maintain so that

3800
02:42:43,680 --> 02:42:45,439
it is always

3801
02:42:45,439 --> 02:42:47,120
effective and efficient

3802
02:42:47,120 --> 02:42:48,880
and it is up to date

3803
02:42:48,880 --> 02:42:51,680
so up to date here means that we saw an

3804
02:42:51,680 --> 02:42:52,800
incident

3805
02:42:52,800 --> 02:42:54,560
struck the country

3806
02:42:54,560 --> 02:42:56,640
we have been able to contain and

3807
02:42:56,640 --> 02:42:58,560
eliminate and educate

3808
02:42:58,560 --> 02:43:00,960
and then we learn from that and once we

3809
02:43:00,960 --> 02:43:03,439
have learned from that then that goes as

3810
02:43:03,439 --> 02:43:05,760
part of the let's say a review process

3811
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:08,080
as a post please say incident activity

3812
02:43:08,080 --> 02:43:09,840
and then if there is a need to be

3813
02:43:09,840 --> 02:43:11,439
changed into that plan in terms of the

3814
02:43:11,439 --> 02:43:13,520
actions or let's say the stakeholders

3815
02:43:13,520 --> 02:43:15,439
actions or

3816
02:43:15,439 --> 02:43:18,000
uh other people who are involved and if

3817
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,080
a new um

3818
02:43:20,080 --> 02:43:22,960
let's say uh some uh new functions needs

3819
02:43:22,960 --> 02:43:25,040
to be brought uh for instance into the

3820
02:43:25,040 --> 02:43:26,800
incident response team or let's say the

3821
02:43:26,800 --> 02:43:30,000
communication team or in uh national

3822
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,160
let's say cyber security committee where

3823
02:43:32,160 --> 02:43:34,319
we have to have let's say some more

3824
02:43:34,319 --> 02:43:36,000
people of different area to understand

3825
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,960
that then uh we normally uh look at it

3826
02:43:38,960 --> 02:43:39,920
so

3827
02:43:39,920 --> 02:43:41,760
that's that that's how

3828
02:43:41,760 --> 02:43:45,120
uh what and is the reason we should be

3829
02:43:45,120 --> 02:43:46,720
reviewing and maintaining our uh

3830
02:43:46,720 --> 02:43:49,600
national cyber uh crisis management plan

3831
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:51,840
okay so and if you see assess and update

3832
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:53,040
information on the capabilities in

3833
02:43:53,040 --> 02:43:55,200
support of cyber incident response goals

3834
02:43:55,200 --> 02:43:56,880
and objectives assimilation exercise

3835
02:43:56,880 --> 02:43:59,040
will help for um the capability

3836
02:43:59,040 --> 02:44:01,680
assessment so uh that's clearly said i

3837
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:03,840
think you understand that part update

3838
02:44:03,840 --> 02:44:05,920
processes based on changes in the

3839
02:44:05,920 --> 02:44:07,760
national cyber threat or hazard

3840
02:44:07,760 --> 02:44:10,880
environment i say that again

3841
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:12,960
because cyber threat landscape changes

3842
02:44:12,960 --> 02:44:15,600
with time and if it changes with time

3843
02:44:15,600 --> 02:44:17,920
that also needs to be reflected because

3844
02:44:17,920 --> 02:44:21,120
these are live documents

3845
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:23,600
so or they are let's say i mean living

3846
02:44:23,600 --> 02:44:25,920
documents and and these living documents

3847
02:44:25,920 --> 02:44:28,880
they needs to or they need to be

3848
02:44:28,880 --> 02:44:31,600
reviewed uh on a regular basis or

3849
02:44:31,600 --> 02:44:35,279
periodically so that they are effective

3850
02:44:35,279 --> 02:44:38,560
once let's say we have to deal with the

3851
02:44:38,560 --> 02:44:41,760
incident of national significance okay

3852
02:44:41,760 --> 02:44:43,520
now

3853
02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:45,200
uh incorporate lessons learned and

3854
02:44:45,200 --> 02:44:47,200
effective practices from day to day

3855
02:44:47,200 --> 02:44:48,880
operations exercises and actual

3856
02:44:48,880 --> 02:44:50,479
incidents and alerts

3857
02:44:50,479 --> 02:44:52,800
uh that's that's also uh something

3858
02:44:52,800 --> 02:44:55,040
already uh we have been

3859
02:44:55,040 --> 02:44:56,880
talking about it

3860
02:44:56,880 --> 02:44:57,920
here

3861
02:44:57,920 --> 02:44:59,520
and adapt to opportunities and

3862
02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:01,520
challenges that arise as technology

3863
02:45:01,520 --> 02:45:03,520
evolves and changes

3864
02:45:03,520 --> 02:45:04,640
okay

3865
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:06,240
you reflect progress in nations cyber

3866
02:45:06,240 --> 02:45:08,000
instant response mission activities the

3867
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,319
need to execute the new laws and

3868
02:45:10,319 --> 02:45:12,479
strategic changes to national priorities

3869
02:45:12,479 --> 02:45:14,800
or national capabilities

3870
02:45:14,800 --> 02:45:16,319
and and lessons learned from some

3871
02:45:16,319 --> 02:45:18,560
exercises or real world incidents so

3872
02:45:18,560 --> 02:45:19,920
these are

3873
02:45:19,920 --> 02:45:22,560
the elements as i said before should be

3874
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:26,240
in here okay i'll move on

3875
02:45:26,319 --> 02:45:28,319
and and and this one much more like i

3876
02:45:28,319 --> 02:45:31,600
wanted to share uh some part of uh

3877
02:45:31,600 --> 02:45:34,000
an example uh so

3878
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,720
uh with the martian experience or or

3879
02:45:36,720 --> 02:45:39,040
this could let's say be uh

3880
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:42,240
mapped to or or model

3881
02:45:42,240 --> 02:45:44,880
for any other unless a similar country

3882
02:45:44,880 --> 02:45:46,800
of let's say this type so mauritius is a

3883
02:45:46,800 --> 02:45:48,479
small country

3884
02:45:48,479 --> 02:45:50,160
and

3885
02:45:50,160 --> 02:45:52,399
very very small in fact

3886
02:45:52,399 --> 02:45:53,120
and

3887
02:45:53,120 --> 02:45:55,439
here we are having this national cyber

3888
02:45:55,439 --> 02:45:57,040
incident response plan we do we do not

3889
02:45:57,040 --> 02:45:58,160
call it as

3890
02:45:58,160 --> 02:46:00,560
a cyber crisis management plan we

3891
02:46:00,560 --> 02:46:01,920
call it as a national cyber instrument

3892
02:46:01,920 --> 02:46:03,200
response plan

3893
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:04,080
and

3894
02:46:04,080 --> 02:46:06,560
in terms of a governance committee

3895
02:46:06,560 --> 02:46:07,920
we're having the

3896
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:09,920
national disaster cyber security and

3897
02:46:09,920 --> 02:46:11,439
cyber crime committee

3898
02:46:11,439 --> 02:46:13,600
uh which is an apex committee and his

3899
02:46:13,600 --> 02:46:15,840
role is to coordinate and monitor the

3900
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:19,040
cyber crisis situation that this one so

3901
02:46:19,040 --> 02:46:20,080
when we were talking about the

3902
02:46:20,080 --> 02:46:21,359
governance so for the governance

3903
02:46:21,359 --> 02:46:22,840
committee we are having

3904
02:46:22,840 --> 02:46:24,880
ndccc okay

3905
02:46:24,880 --> 02:46:27,279
uh it comprises of different members

3906
02:46:27,279 --> 02:46:29,040
from the public in the private sector so

3907
02:46:29,040 --> 02:46:31,439
there are nine permanent and 21 extended

3908
02:46:31,439 --> 02:46:34,640
members so it's like a

3909
02:46:35,200 --> 02:46:36,240
committee

3910
02:46:36,240 --> 02:46:38,560
which have uh which has

3911
02:46:38,560 --> 02:46:40,800
many extended members uh and they will

3912
02:46:40,800 --> 02:46:44,240
be opted uh in depending on the nature

3913
02:46:44,240 --> 02:46:46,800
of the incident so if let's say uh it it

3914
02:46:46,800 --> 02:46:50,319
connects to a hospitality um sector so

3915
02:46:50,319 --> 02:46:52,720
maybe a representative of hospitality

3916
02:46:52,720 --> 02:46:55,040
sector could be called in that

3917
02:46:55,040 --> 02:46:56,640
particular let's say

3918
02:46:56,640 --> 02:46:59,279
uh crisis meeting uh with the nine

3919
02:46:59,279 --> 02:47:02,240
command members uh to discuss on to the

3920
02:47:02,240 --> 02:47:04,720
issue of that sector that's what uh we

3921
02:47:04,720 --> 02:47:07,840
mean to say here okay

3922
02:47:07,840 --> 02:47:10,080
now uh and dcc is uh chaired by the

3923
02:47:10,080 --> 02:47:11,760
minister of iit or coming in secretary

3924
02:47:11,760 --> 02:47:13,680
depending on the stability of incidents

3925
02:47:13,680 --> 02:47:15,439
so we we are having a scale of one to

3926
02:47:15,439 --> 02:47:18,000
five here not let's say five to zero to

3927
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,640
five so our scale is one to five

3928
02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:22,479
one is the least critical five is the

3929
02:47:22,479 --> 02:47:23,920
most critical

3930
02:47:23,920 --> 02:47:26,800
so if there is an incident of magnitude

3931
02:47:26,800 --> 02:47:29,519
five four

3932
02:47:29,760 --> 02:47:32,640
that's that's uh something

3933
02:47:32,640 --> 02:47:35,600
uh uh addressed by the uh chaired by the

3934
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:37,520
minister if there is let's say three to

3935
02:47:37,520 --> 02:47:40,880
one then um normally uh not one in fact

3936
02:47:40,880 --> 02:47:44,960
uh three uh or or or two even so if it's

3937
02:47:44,960 --> 02:47:47,120
three uh then it is going to be chaired

3938
02:47:47,120 --> 02:47:49,359
by the permanent secretary if it's one

3939
02:47:49,359 --> 02:47:51,840
it doesn't go anywhere it is managed by

3940
02:47:51,840 --> 02:47:53,760
the national insert and the other

3941
02:47:53,760 --> 02:47:55,760
stakeholders who are the part of let's

3942
02:47:55,760 --> 02:47:58,000
say the whole resolution

3943
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,560
incident resolution uh let's say team or

3944
02:48:00,560 --> 02:48:02,479
incident response scheme so these people

3945
02:48:02,479 --> 02:48:04,560
they sit together they try to resolve

3946
02:48:04,560 --> 02:48:07,920
that incident so that's one a very

3947
02:48:07,920 --> 02:48:09,920
uh good example for you to understand

3948
02:48:09,920 --> 02:48:13,680
how uh it looks okay

3949
02:48:13,680 --> 02:48:16,000
uh now if i uh

3950
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:17,520
get back to uh

3951
02:48:17,520 --> 02:48:18,880
the other slide

3952
02:48:18,880 --> 02:48:21,200
so the the the plan defines the incident

3953
02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:24,080
response and public relations

3954
02:48:24,080 --> 02:48:26,399
and we have been talking about this

3955
02:48:26,399 --> 02:48:28,880
and and the incident response team you

3956
02:48:28,880 --> 02:48:30,800
know now what it is a regulation stream

3957
02:48:30,800 --> 02:48:32,640
again now you know what it is

3958
02:48:32,640 --> 02:48:34,960
and uh incident response team comprised

3959
02:48:34,960 --> 02:48:37,920
of national cert iit uh security unit of

3960
02:48:37,920 --> 02:48:39,760
the ministry of iit and mauritius froze

3961
02:48:39,760 --> 02:48:41,600
and internet service providers so that's

3962
02:48:41,600 --> 02:48:43,840
how the composition of the team looks

3963
02:48:43,840 --> 02:48:46,240
like okay

3964
02:48:46,240 --> 02:48:48,560
now uh public relations team consists of

3965
02:48:48,560 --> 02:48:49,840
communication persons from the

3966
02:48:49,840 --> 02:48:51,359
minister's office

3967
02:48:51,359 --> 02:48:53,760
the government information system unit

3968
02:48:53,760 --> 02:48:56,479
a representative of the

3969
02:48:56,479 --> 02:49:00,000
pmo and also a representative from

3970
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
incident response team

3971
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:03,920
thus

3972
02:49:03,920 --> 02:49:06,000
public relations teams why we have

3973
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,800
technical people also in that to guide

3974
02:49:08,800 --> 02:49:11,040
the legislative communications team how

3975
02:49:11,040 --> 02:49:14,560
to let's say uh translate

3976
02:49:14,560 --> 02:49:17,200
the technical terms into a simple form

3977
02:49:17,200 --> 02:49:20,000
so that people outside could understand

3978
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:21,279
location to hold meetings during the

3979
02:49:21,279 --> 02:49:23,600
cyber crisis is officer the ministry of

3980
02:49:23,600 --> 02:49:26,640
iit so this also is fixed if it happens

3981
02:49:26,640 --> 02:49:29,760
it happens here okay

3982
02:49:29,760 --> 02:49:32,000
now few let's say more things i wanted

3983
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:33,840
to a share

3984
02:49:33,840 --> 02:49:36,399
now we have also

3985
02:49:36,399 --> 02:49:39,439
been using the tlp tlp is used for the

3986
02:49:39,439 --> 02:49:41,279
information exchange so this is already

3987
02:49:41,279 --> 02:49:44,960
clearly defined uh what tlp

3988
02:49:44,960 --> 02:49:45,760
and

3989
02:49:45,760 --> 02:49:47,040
classification

3990
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:48,720
uh five level of severity is defined

3991
02:49:48,720 --> 02:49:50,880
that already have site uh level two

3992
02:49:50,880 --> 02:49:52,880
civility incidents will be

3993
02:49:52,880 --> 02:49:54,319
coordinated under the championship of

3994
02:49:54,319 --> 02:49:57,439
the ps so two three ps three five uh

3995
02:49:57,439 --> 02:49:58,800
let's say uh

3996
02:49:58,800 --> 02:49:59,760
uh

3997
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:03,279
is is is uh will be coordinated under

3998
02:50:03,279 --> 02:50:05,279
the chairmanship of the minister

3999
02:50:05,279 --> 02:50:09,560
okay so i think

4000
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:11,520
three five

4001
02:50:11,520 --> 02:50:13,920
data

4002
02:50:18,720 --> 02:50:22,039
so three

4003
02:50:28,160 --> 02:50:30,479
okay uh sorry about that uh

4004
02:50:30,479 --> 02:50:31,840
just let's say some technical

4005
02:50:31,840 --> 02:50:33,840
difficulties we got

4006
02:50:33,840 --> 02:50:36,000
so level three five civility incidents

4007
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:37,279
will be coordinated under the

4008
02:50:37,279 --> 02:50:39,920
championship of the minister so uh three

4009
02:50:39,920 --> 02:50:42,479
five is for the minister and and then

4010
02:50:42,479 --> 02:50:45,200
two is for the ps so uh that's something

4011
02:50:45,200 --> 02:50:46,640
on the previous slide i said four five

4012
02:50:46,640 --> 02:50:48,960
no it's not four five is three five so

4013
02:50:48,960 --> 02:50:51,680
three to five is where the minister

4014
02:50:51,680 --> 02:50:54,560
chase the committee

4015
02:50:54,560 --> 02:50:57,120
and then the testing of the plan um

4016
02:50:57,120 --> 02:50:59,120
let's say uh

4017
02:50:59,120 --> 02:51:01,120
is done on a regular basis

4018
02:51:01,120 --> 02:51:03,439
uh and have this provision has been made

4019
02:51:03,439 --> 02:51:05,359
at the level of the national cert

4020
02:51:05,359 --> 02:51:08,960
and and uh execution uh let's say of the

4021
02:51:08,960 --> 02:51:10,080
plan

4022
02:51:10,080 --> 02:51:12,080
is done on a regular basis so this is

4023
02:51:12,080 --> 02:51:13,920
like a periodical

4024
02:51:13,920 --> 02:51:17,600
execution we are talking about okay

4025
02:51:17,600 --> 02:51:18,720
uh

4026
02:51:18,720 --> 02:51:21,120
in in the next uh let's say uh

4027
02:51:21,120 --> 02:51:23,120
uh here also uh

4028
02:51:23,120 --> 02:51:24,640
important considerations to set up a

4029
02:51:24,640 --> 02:51:26,080
national level committee which members

4030
02:51:26,080 --> 02:51:27,120
who have the experience and

4031
02:51:27,120 --> 02:51:28,240
understanding of

4032
02:51:28,240 --> 02:51:31,279
cyber threat handling and resolution

4033
02:51:31,279 --> 02:51:32,880
to assess the capacity of the team which

4034
02:51:32,880 --> 02:51:34,319
we're dealing with during the cyber

4035
02:51:34,319 --> 02:51:36,000
crisis so

4036
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,319
these are a few things

4037
02:51:38,319 --> 02:51:39,600
which uh

4038
02:51:39,600 --> 02:51:41,279
uh let's say could be considered once

4039
02:51:41,279 --> 02:51:44,319
let's say we are talking about

4040
02:51:44,319 --> 02:51:47,040
the incident response plan to assess the

4041
02:51:47,040 --> 02:51:48,479
information sharing and communication

4042
02:51:48,479 --> 02:51:50,160
efficiency of the public relations team

4043
02:51:50,160 --> 02:51:53,040
so this is what we have done

4044
02:51:53,040 --> 02:51:54,399
and and then

4045
02:51:54,399 --> 02:51:55,279
uh

4046
02:51:55,279 --> 02:51:56,560
here

4047
02:51:56,560 --> 02:51:58,560
we are let's say

4048
02:51:58,560 --> 02:52:00,640
uh in a way

4049
02:52:00,640 --> 02:52:02,960
uh end of let's say at this discussion

4050
02:52:02,960 --> 02:52:05,520
of uh implementation

4051
02:52:05,520 --> 02:52:08,560
uh and testing and and monitoring

4052
02:52:08,560 --> 02:52:11,520
so uh yeah in in a way uh

4053
02:52:11,520 --> 02:52:14,319
we have been able to

4054
02:52:14,319 --> 02:52:15,640
discuss

4055
02:52:15,640 --> 02:52:16,880
[Music]

4056
02:52:16,880 --> 02:52:19,039
the

4057
02:52:19,120 --> 02:52:21,520
a whole understanding

4058
02:52:21,520 --> 02:52:23,439
of how

4059
02:52:23,439 --> 02:52:26,960
a national cyber crisis management plan

4060
02:52:26,960 --> 02:52:29,200
normally

4061
02:52:29,200 --> 02:52:30,720
what it is

4062
02:52:30,720 --> 02:52:31,760
uh

4063
02:52:31,760 --> 02:52:34,160
how it should be designed

4064
02:52:34,160 --> 02:52:37,120
how it should be implemented tested and

4065
02:52:37,120 --> 02:52:38,319
monitored

4066
02:52:38,319 --> 02:52:39,359
plus

4067
02:52:39,359 --> 02:52:42,560
we have given you an example

4068
02:52:42,560 --> 02:52:44,160
of mauritius

4069
02:52:44,160 --> 02:52:45,120
how

4070
02:52:45,120 --> 02:52:46,640
that plan

4071
02:52:46,640 --> 02:52:48,399
has been implemented

4072
02:52:48,399 --> 02:52:49,520
so

4073
02:52:49,520 --> 02:52:51,439
i believe

4074
02:52:51,439 --> 02:52:52,960
that with this

4075
02:52:52,960 --> 02:52:55,359
you have a clear idea

4076
02:52:55,359 --> 02:52:57,359
at least the basic understanding

4077
02:52:57,359 --> 02:52:59,439
uh what national

4078
02:52:59,439 --> 02:53:03,439
cyber crisis management plan looks like

4079
02:53:03,439 --> 02:53:05,520
and and uh

4080
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:07,120
how it is

4081
02:53:07,120 --> 02:53:08,160
written

4082
02:53:08,160 --> 02:53:09,040
so

4083
02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:13,439
with this uh maybe uh again uh

4084
02:53:13,439 --> 02:53:15,040
we have reached to

4085
02:53:15,040 --> 02:53:17,279
uh an end of let's say the training but

4086
02:53:17,279 --> 02:53:18,080
uh

4087
02:53:18,080 --> 02:53:22,880
uh still we have some 45 minutes

4088
02:53:23,120 --> 02:53:25,520
and and we are very much open to any

4089
02:53:25,520 --> 02:53:27,840
discussion anyone wants to

4090
02:53:27,840 --> 02:53:28,640
have

4091
02:53:28,640 --> 02:53:30,399
from the participants

4092
02:53:30,399 --> 02:53:32,479
and

4093
02:53:32,479 --> 02:53:35,279
we'll be happy to take any questions uh

4094
02:53:35,279 --> 02:53:37,359
we'll be happy to happy to discuss more

4095
02:53:37,359 --> 02:53:38,640
around this

4096
02:53:38,640 --> 02:53:40,319
uh

4097
02:53:40,319 --> 02:53:41,040
and

4098
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:42,720
um

4099
02:53:42,720 --> 02:53:44,080
we we

4100
02:53:44,080 --> 02:53:45,680
we're available

4101
02:53:45,680 --> 02:53:48,319
so let me open the flow now uh and and

4102
02:53:48,319 --> 02:53:53,080
if there are any questions please do ask

4103
02:53:58,399 --> 02:54:00,640
so i think there were some questions

4104
02:54:00,640 --> 02:54:03,760
by mustafa

4105
02:54:05,520 --> 02:54:07,439
i think we have answered those questions

4106
02:54:07,439 --> 02:54:09,920
while discussing the second part of

4107
02:54:09,920 --> 02:54:11,359
um the

4108
02:54:11,359 --> 02:54:12,640
uh

4109
02:54:12,640 --> 02:54:13,760
training program where we have been

4110
02:54:13,760 --> 02:54:16,880
talking about the design uh how the

4111
02:54:16,880 --> 02:54:19,600
national cyber crisis management plan is

4112
02:54:19,600 --> 02:54:21,600
normally designed how can we uh what are

4113
02:54:21,600 --> 02:54:23,680
the elements

4114
02:54:23,680 --> 02:54:25,200
and and

4115
02:54:25,200 --> 02:54:29,040
how the classification how the priority

4116
02:54:29,040 --> 02:54:30,479
how the

4117
02:54:30,479 --> 02:54:35,760
severity level is is defined okay

4118
02:54:35,760 --> 02:54:40,560
so if if there are any more questions

4119
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:44,880
we'll be happy to

4120
02:54:45,439 --> 02:54:47,439
assist

4121
02:54:47,439 --> 02:54:49,840
an answer

4122
02:54:52,880 --> 02:54:55,880
okay

4123
02:55:06,640 --> 02:55:08,960
so looks looks like there are no

4124
02:55:08,960 --> 02:55:10,399
questions

4125
02:55:10,399 --> 02:55:11,520
and

4126
02:55:11,520 --> 02:55:13,920
if if there are no questions then maybe

4127
02:55:13,920 --> 02:55:16,800
you know we have reached to the end of

4128
02:55:16,800 --> 02:55:19,840
let's say this uh training uh program

4129
02:55:19,840 --> 02:55:21,279
and

4130
02:55:21,279 --> 02:55:22,240

02:55:27,920 --> 02:55:31,359
uh as well as the interpreters who have

4134
02:55:31,359 --> 02:55:32,720
been with us

4135

nearly

4137
02:55:36,319 --> 02:55:38,000
uh in a way or let's say three hours

4138
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,240
