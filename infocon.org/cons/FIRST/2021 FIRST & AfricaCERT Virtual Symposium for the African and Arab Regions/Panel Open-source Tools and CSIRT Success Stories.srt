are using in establishment of national

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,599
caesar

105
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,279
here just as a brief

106
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,478
idea and about the itu certa program

107
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,400
so the itu is working with member states

108
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,880
to build capacity at national and also

109
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,520
at regional level to deploy capabilities

110
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,280
and assist in establishment and

111
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,440
enhancing the national computer incident

112
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,919
response team third or this year to

113
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,880
search

114
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,080
so far itu uh uh has conducted around

115
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,720
the

116
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,120
or more maybe because the last week we

117
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,199
already finished finalizing mongolia's

118
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,000
third assessment we did more than a plus

119
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,479
80 search readiness assessment

120
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,919
also we conducted a 173rd project

121
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,120
implementation in more than 14 countries

122
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,040
and in 2021 and 2022 uh we have seven

123
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,960
ongoing third project

124
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,240
like bahamas malawi barbados botswana

125
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,080
which already in the closing process

126
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,960
gambia burundi and and kenya

127
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,720
so

128
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,039
it was working mainly in in assisting

129
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,240
countries in developing their

130
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,479
capabilities and capacity at national

131
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,440
level

132
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,080
in order to implement the national cert

133
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,240
we have the itu search framework and

134
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,919
this framework

135
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,800
is based in four phases

136
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,560
so the first phase we start by the

137
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,360
assessment design establishment and

138
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,039
enhancement phase

139
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,960
the first phase which is the assessment

140
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,440
where the primary objective is to assist

141
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,560
the country

142
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
in the assessment of its readiness to

143
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,479
implement a national search

144
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,880
and as a deliverable of this

145
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,520
of this phase we provide the country

146
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,440
with an assessment report that present

147
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,000
the way forward to launch requirements

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,759
for national assert for example we

149
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,520
assess the countries if there is a law

150
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,919
needed to be reviewed or any

151
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,319
policy that should be established before

152
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,000
implementing the national assert we

153
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,080
advise the countries based in

154
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,039
international good good practices

155
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,280
the second phase which is uh come after

156
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,199
the assessment which is the design where

157
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,440
we prepare and detail detailed design

158
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,440
document for the national scissors or

159
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,000
the government scissors as we are mainly

160
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,720
focusing in these two aspects only

161
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,800
where as the delivery boards we develop

162
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,639
a blueprint document of the national

163
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,479
search project with related

164
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,120
implementation process tools services

165
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,800
and also the capacity building and

166
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,280
trainings needed for for the team

167
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,120
as soon as we finish this phase we move

168
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,639
to the next one which is the

169
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,120
establishment phase where we execute the

170
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,880
project as agreed with the with the

171
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,520
member states and based in the outcome

172
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,960
and the design

173
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,720
services deliverables

174
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,720
the last phase which is an enhancement

175
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,280
phase where we uh we establish a new

176
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
additional services or we improve the

177
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,000
existing services delivery for this

178
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,639
national search so our uh certain

179
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,720
framework is aligned with the first

180
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,520
services sincere services framework

181
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,440
where we focus mainly on uncited

182
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,680
response capabilities with national

183
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,120
responsibility

184
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,599
also we are working right now in

185
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,000
in the review of this framework where we

186
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,720
also will include this the symmetry

187
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,120
maturity level to be also included as a

188
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,319
part of

189
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,319
one of the phases and it will be the

190
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,160
assessment of the maturity and it will

191
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,039
be

192
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,800
fifth phase and we are working here with

193
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,479
the colleagues from scissors foundation

194
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,560
in the development and review of this

195
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,599
phase which maybe we expect by 2022 will

196
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,280
be published

197
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,160
so here in general the list of uh phases

198
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,639
that where we we work on it to establish

199
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,080
research

200
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,960
here

201
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,039
in the next two slides we i will try to

202
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,199
share with you simple tools simple tools

203
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,440
that we are using uh to implement the

204
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,400
national cert so sometimes in our most

205
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,599
of the cases our work and our projects

206
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,759
are based in least developing countries

207
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,319
or developing countries so this country

208
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,120
they have some specificity so we need to

209
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,240
and also sometimes they don't have them

210
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,879
enough financial resources

211
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,199
to purchase some commercial tools so we

212
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,960
try first to help them in the beginning

213
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,759
of this third project to start with

214
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,240
using the open source tools and here

215
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,960
these open source tools it can be

216
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,879
as a big advantage for these countries

217
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,520
to develop first their national national

218
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
expertise and to develop the capacity of

219
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
their national teams so they need to

220
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,520
invest more in the capacity and

221
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,440
capability development of the teams

222
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,039
rather than investing in in the

223
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,120
commercial tools which can be maybe in

224
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,039
the next phase as soon as they became

225
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,719
more and more mature but in the

226
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,000
beginning

227
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,679
they need also to work in the in

228
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,760
developing of the capabilities and

229
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,080
expertise of the national team so here

230
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,959
is

231
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:49,839
some

232
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,839
list which is not exhaustive so just

233
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,880
here i i use some simple tools for you

234
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,680
so for example for the third website or

235
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,519
the portal where the country they need

236
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,279
to report incident or they need to

237
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,800
advisory to read advisory from the

238
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,959
national search so we can use here

239
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,200
different tools such as the open source

240
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,080
tools the opencms like

241
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,160
the wordpress or drupal

242
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,640
also as a newsletter management system

243
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,120
we can we suggest also to use the php

244
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,279
list which is a very powerful list that

245
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,600
we use to send advisories to the country

246
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,480
to the where the certified advisors uh

247
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,720
to his uh constituency

248
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
also as a threat and vulnerability

249
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,680
tracking or monitoring tools uh here we

250
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,360
we suggest to you the tyrannies which is

251
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,920
developed by the netherlands cert and it

252
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,680
is an open source tools and also it is

253
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,760
very very powerful

254
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,880
also

255
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,360
as a part of the uh vulnerability

256
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,080
assessment and testing services

257
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,680
we can use

258
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,040
different tools

259
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,560
such as kali linux metasploit nessus and

260
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,680
map and so on and so on so here is you

261
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,040
can check in the internet there are

262
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,519
plenty of of of

263
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,440
of tools which are open source and also

264
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,120
are very very powerful tools that can be

265
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,000
used by machine concept

266
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,160
also another benchmark of tools that can

267
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,480
be used as an example here the security

268
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,959
asset response platform

269
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,760
like here we can use the hyper project

270
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,920
or the hive tools which is a so far is

271
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,480
an open source also we are using a in

272
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
other projects the rtir

273
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,480
also another important tool that can be

274
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,560
used for tracking the incident

275
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,000
management

276
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,760
as a threat intelligence and sharing

277
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,079
platform uh here we're using the miss

278
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,680
which is developed by uh by the

279
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,360
luxembourg cert and then maintain it by

280
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,519
them which i think is one of the most

281
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,600
powerful tools not the national

282
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,839
should use it and we use also the

283
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,920
different component including in this

284
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,800
platform like cortex tool and many other

285
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,760
tools

286
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,680
also we use the hornet platform which we

287
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,760
called as a services of honeypot we're

288
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,760
using here the teapot which is developed

289
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,839
by dutch telecom also is another

290
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,200
important tool

291
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,680
then we have also as a cyber threat

292
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,959
intelligence we use the open cti which

293
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,519
is also uh

294
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,920
very good important uh

295
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,920
open source for flight intelligence also

296
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,079
there is dental cue also another tool

297
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,560
that we are using regardless of

298
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,519
forensics there are many many many tools

299
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,079
that can be used by national cert

300
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,880
like and and here uh uh i just as i

301
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,399
mentioned one which is one of the

302
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,640
lattice lattice tool published by the us

303
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,800
government which is the

304
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,519
guidra so for for malware analysis and

305
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,680
you can find in the internet

306
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
many of tools that uh to assist you in

307
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
building yourself so

308
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,440
we advise countries especially the

309
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,720
developing and these developing

310
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,040
countries in the beginning in the first

311
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,120
two or three years in their operations

312
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,160
to use

313
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,920
these open source tools and then they

314
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,000
can decide which commercial tools they

315
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,360
can switch their

316
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,480
needs

317
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,639
so yeah this is in general uh

318
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,600
for the third project also as a part of

319
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,800
of our cyber drills and also capacity

320
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,320
building activity that itu are

321
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,880
conducting which is here uh the national

322
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,200
regional and global cyber drills

323
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,880
and uh

324
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,959
also we we try to train countries to

325
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,519
using different this uh these different

326
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,519
open source tools so we try to build

327
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,680
the search using uh

328
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,720
the open source tools also we try to to

329
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
build the capacity and to do the

330
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,880
continuous learning using these open

331
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,000
source tools

332
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,839
uh honestly we don't use only these open

333
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,760
source also we use commercial so we

334
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,120
encourage countries

335
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,440
based on their needs and also based

336
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,320
in

337
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,399
on the needs and also the capabilities

338
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,639
available entire countries

339
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,600
to use these these tools so far we can

340
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,959
see here just as last

341
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,519
numbers we conducted over 32 cyber

342
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,720
exercise

343
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,680

360
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,160
since he have uh

361
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,839
very urgent

362
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,519
familial things

363
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,040
so if

364
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,360
there is a question or

365
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,030
we can go through to

366
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,189
[Music]

367
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,880
okay maybe

368
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,680
is

369
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,519
mr almo is

370
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,839
yes i am

371
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,760
so now i have a great pleasure to

372
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,160
introduce

373
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,240
the chief strategy official warcraft

374
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,800
he was the peer pioneer cto of the

375
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,440
national research and education network

376
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,120
and continued to work on the technical

377
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,959
development of high capacity network

378
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,560
complexes

379
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,519
for research and education

380
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,079
showcase what's happening with african

381
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,480
area and and link with open initiative

382
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,920
that would be

383
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,519
beneficial

384
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,519
and as you imagine open source tools

385
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,760
feature quite high

386
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,720
in the

387
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,279
agenda

388
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,639
thank you very much nabil um

389
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,160
so i just want to confirm that you can

390
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,399
see my slides

391
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,000
so if

392
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,399
somebody can confirm i will proceed yep

393
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,440
excellent

394
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,199
so i'm going to be talking about an

395
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,279
initiative that's come out of the

396
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,320
african research network space we've

397
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,959
called it trust broker africa

398
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,120
and it's essentially a

399
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,320
corporation framework and infrastructure

400
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,839
to support the corporation

401
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,160
oops yeah

402
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,440
so

403
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,120
i just talked about the first line i'm

404
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,880
going to try and go through this as

405
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,800
quick as possible because i'd like the

406
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,440
questions and uh nabila said the less

407
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,040
time i spend the more questions i get

408
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,759
it is a cooperation framework

409
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,880
uh

410
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,040
you know focused on african-american

411
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,079
sets

412
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:48,880
but

413
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,199
uh such infrastructure does not really

414
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,920
exist in africa so we're hoping that you

415
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,639
know uh it will be used by all kinds of

416
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,880
security teams

417
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,199
so for those who are

418
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,519
familiar with um

419
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,240
trusted introducer from in europe i

420
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,399
think some african teams are actually

421
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,800
listed on that platform

422
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,279
it is uh it is very similar

423
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,560
we um

424
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,959
we are working as you will find out with

425
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,120
the open system foundation

426
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,199
which is which is responsible for that

427
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,160
platform to stop and show some

428
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,720
complementarity between what we do and

429
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,120
our european partners

430
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,160
so it's on the slide it does for those

431
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,560
that do not know it lists

432
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,399
security teams the platform released

433
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,360
security teams accredited accredit them

434
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,480
with uh

435
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,399
based on principles of the community

436
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,920
that support it

437
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,720
and then provides member services

438
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,560
so alongside alongside the

439
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,160
infrastructure we also have a plan

440
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,680
for training

441
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,279
and infrastructure development

442
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,440
so at this point in time

443
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,759
those are the partners in trust broker

444
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,720
africa

445
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,799
the free regional rents

446
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,280
uh open system foundation

447
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,760
uh the africa connect free project

448
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,000
and uh the european commission through

449
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,720
its funding

450
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,400
so i was i talked about the africa

451
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,839
connect three project which is really

452
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,480
driving uh the funding of this

453
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,760
initiative

454
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,520
so i thought i'll just um share a bit

455
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,679
with you know the folks who are not

456
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,520
familiar with what the research networks

457
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,440
are doing in africa and this particular

458
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,480
project

459
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,360
so this is a project co-funded by

460
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,880
the european union and african

461
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,720
engineering partners

462
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,960
so we have been this particular

463
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,240
iteration started in 2019 but the

464
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
project is 10 years old

465
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,480
so in the 10 years we've managed to

466
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,600
connect

467
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,200
22 out of the 38 enrons in africa so

468
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,520
basically creating interconnection of

469
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,919
these national networks across the

470
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,280
continent

471
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,080
and in this particular iteration africa

472
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,280
connect three

473
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,840
we are focused on certain initiatives

474
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,080
crossbroke africa is one of them and

475
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,720
human capacity building

476
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,880
so although this is new

477
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,520
this is uh this is a this is an idea

478
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,039
that has that is

479
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,480
at least

480
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,799
six to seven years old there have been

481
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,600
several unsuccessful attempts to

482
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,679
get this going some

483
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,520
in partnership with africa set and

484
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,960
others

485
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,200
but we finally got some funding in 2019.

486
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,640
[Music]

487
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,039
so what we really plan to do is make

488
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,760
sure that you know end rents are

489
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,919
can be catered for with security teams

490
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,840
and these security teams have a path to

491
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,520
maturity

492
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,360
we also want to provide a platform for

493
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,799
cooperative processing of threat

494
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,720
intelligence and data

495
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,320
we see these networks in as

496
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,320
the african research education networks

497
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,440
and universities as uh a vital part of

498
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,520
that whole ecosystem that we should all

499
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,039
work with

500
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,039
and then we do have a

501
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,120
capacity building plan under something

502
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,400
we call the africa training initiative

503
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,720
which is essentially inverting

504
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,360
the cost profile of training so instead

505
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,200
of taking people to

506
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,760
uh training we bring the trainers to the

507
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,960
people

508
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,360
so under that we're having like

509
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,400
sunscreen

510
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,200
transits to get people started

511
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,039
we have three regions like i mentioned

512
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,440
uh for the regional research networks i

513
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,120
work for wakaran

514
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,520
wakaran is a western central african

515
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,679
region but it's also the abundant

516
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,559
alliance in the south and east and asran

517
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,400
which covers you know north africa and

518
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
the arab regions

519
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,880
so we we will start with you know

520
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,440
training to get the enren's sister

521
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,080
started and uh training to support them

522
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,120
as they as they go

523
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,200
so that's the first we've we've kicked

524
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,039
this off in in uh

525
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,400
october uh in togo in loma togo

526
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,120
now this is uh it was hosted by the

527
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,280
enren and the national set set.tg

528
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,960
now this is a model that we would like

529
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,240
to promote

530
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,039
so in every every time we we sort of

531
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,200
establish an entrance set

532
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,640
we have some way to connect it to the

533
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,000
local ecosystem uh within the country

534
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and beyond

535
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,240
so they say pictures um

536
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,039
uh speaking thousand words so we have

537
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,039
classrooms and we had a good actually

538
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,280
had a visit from awkwasi

539
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,480
awkwas is a regional project um

540
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,880
collaboration between echoes

541
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,880
and uh the eu

542
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,679
so

543
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,880
they came and joined us in togo um those

544
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,039
are the sort of relationships we're

545
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,200
looking to build one of the reasons why

546
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,679
i'm here talking to you is also to to

547
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,320
sort of encourage more uh more contact

548
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,600
so this is my last slide so um i've left

549
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,080
it pretty empty so you could ask me

550
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,120
questions

551
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,480
but um it's really i'm here to call uh

552
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,720
for collaboration i've been listening to

553
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,120
quite a few of the presentations

554
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,000
i can see that you know uh there's the

555
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,480
we can fill a gap here we can fill it up

556
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,840
here

557
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,600
there's much more that we can do within

558
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,679
academia and the research and the

559
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,440
research networks and i

560
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,760
and it'd be really interesting for those

561
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,720
who find these interesting to connect to

562
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,440
us

563
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,200
but what we would like to do is uh to

564
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,120
find some concrete ways in which can we

565
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,640
can work together

566
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,559
we definitely want to link in the model

567
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,760
i described first on a national level

568
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,039
then on the regional level and

569
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,880
continental as the case may be we're

570
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,360
working very closely with africa cert

571
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,240
but we also want to work with others

572
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,600
like you know i mentioned that this

573
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,600
infrastructure does not really exist in

574
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,679
africa at the moment so we want to share

575
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:56,880
it

576
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,000
and we are open to how that's developed

577
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,799
we we see this as being governed by the

578
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,520
community so we want to sort of grow

579
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,360
that community

580
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,880
and then in terms of the service

581
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,960
infrastructure that we we talked about

582
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,120
we want to extend that as well we

583
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,360
haven't actually started developing the

584
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,440
threat intelligence platform

585
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,360
we i can see that obviously more

586
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,799
competence in the

587
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,000
in the uh

588
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
community there's the cyber security

589
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,919
community and we might have

590
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,240
within us and we'd like to leverage that

591
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,679
as well

592
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,440
so i have left an email address there

593
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,720
for anyone who's interested to email us

594
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,679
and

595
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,559
i'd

596
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,399
be grateful for your questions thank you

597
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,280
thank you thank you um for this very

598
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,640
interesting

599
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,480
presentation and i think the call is

600
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,720
made the people will be interested to

601
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,159
join

602
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,400
and maybe we shall

603
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,280
go to the next presentation which will

604
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,360
be made by

605
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,240
mr kevin maynard a member of the

606
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,480
internet society leading the airmen als

607
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,799
project which is materials here at

608
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,400
norman voting

609
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,600
security

610
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,200
an industry developers in fact

611
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,520
initiative aiming to improve

612
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,840
the security and residence of a global

613
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,320
internet routing system

614
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,960
mr kevin will show

615
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,320
his mother

616
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
my nervous

617
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,240
activity in second english and another

618
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,320
frustration

619
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,760
i will

620
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,559
as

621
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,399
i did stand the cv

622
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,960
okay thank you professor the bill uh can

623
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,480
you hear me okay and can you see the

624
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,159
slides on the screen

625
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,240
kevin we can see your slides okay thank

626
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,640
you very much okay so yes i wanted to

627
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,400
well thank you very much for allowing me

628
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,480
to come and talk about the manners

629
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,960
initiative uh but also the managed

630
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,799
observatory tool that we've been uh

631
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,559
developing over the past

632
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,480
couple of years

633
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,440
so i just wanted to set the scene um as

634
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,240
to why we're doing this um

635
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,600
so there are nearly uh 73 000 networks

636
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
connected to the internet

637
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,360
which each use an autonomous system

638
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,320
number to identify themselves

639
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,760
and there are also

640
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,480
just over 902 000

641
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,080
advertised routes on the internet so

642
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,840
this is the scale of the global

643
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
internet now bgp is a well-established

644
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
and reliable protocol that is used to

645
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,880
exchange reachability information um but

646
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,360
it's based entirely on unverified trust

647
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,679
between networks

648
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,919
so in other words there's no built-in

649
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,360
validation that

650
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,760
routing updates are legitimate

651
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,279
and basically anyone can announce

652
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,440
anything and any network can masquerade

653
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,279
as another network so that's the basic

654
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,799
problem

655
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,200
that we're up against

656
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,440
so the result is that the routing system

657
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,880
is under attack

658
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,559
every day uh

659
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,480
and there's sort of three types of

660
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,720
uh incident that we see you have rap

661
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,320
hijacks

662
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,480
this is where a network is essentially

663
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,240
claiming to be another network and can

664
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,400
route to that network uh you have route

665
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,799
leaks which is uh essentially a miss

666
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,679
origination so that the packets will go

667
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:22,799
through the wrong network to the

668
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,960
destination usually we'll get there but

669
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,720
it's often accidental for this

670
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,279
configuration

671
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,799
and then finally you have vip address

672
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,320
moving which is actually perhaps more

673
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,080
familiar to people

674
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,159
so this is one of the causes of

675
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,840
distributed denial of service attacks

676
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,320
for example

677
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,360
now these issues have been known for a

678
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,679
long time um and there are established

679
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,159
solutions um i should say established

680
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,640
well then established industry solutions

681
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,919
um

682
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,600
but one of the disincentives to

683
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,840
introducing these either each network

684
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,279
operator needs to contribute to the

685
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,440
routing security

686
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,520
and by themselves implementing

687
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,520
these measures by yourself

688
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,640
doesn't actually bring immediate

689
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,440
benefits to your network

690
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,960
but the particular problem is that

691
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,799
routing incidents can be

692
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,600
also quite hard to identify um debugging

693
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,520
fix as well

694
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,960
so bandos is therefore trying to bring

695
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,679
together these practices um by providing

696
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:20,480
these

697
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,320
well-defined actions you can see those

698
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,559
on the on the slide and the aim is

699
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,720
really to eliminate um

700
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,320
most of the common threats to the global

701
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,960
routing system um so it's really based

702
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,760
on

703
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,360
the idea that if enough network

704
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,480
operators

705
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,159
implement these measures

706
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,159
and collaborate to to improve writing

707
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,919
security uh this will improve uh

708
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,080
the the security and resilience of the

709
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,720
internet infrastructure

710
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,640
so just looking at the four main actions

711
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,400
uh that we have um we have filtering um

712
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,360
so

713
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,960
this is really setting up your routers

714
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,120
so that um it's preventing propagation

715
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,080
of

716
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,640
incorrect information information um

717
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,159
ensuring that your route announcements

718
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,760
are correct

719
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,720
um

720
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,679
you have

721
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,679
anti-spoofing so this is preventing

722
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,039
traffic uh with source ip addresses from

723
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,880
um emanating from your networks

724
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,400
you have coordination so this is a

725
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,000
two-pronged thing so this is ensuring

726
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,840
that your contact information is valid

727
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,120
and up to date

728
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,960
but also that

729
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,039
you're responsive if you're if you do

730
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,279
experience a network incident you can

731
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,200
respond to other networks quickly and

732
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,600
address those problems

733
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,960
and finally you have

734
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,039
global validation so this is again two

735
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,559
pronged uh

736
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,720
two prompt things so you can either put

737
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,520
your publish your routing information in

738
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,240
a internet routing registry um in africa

739
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,919
typically that would be the afrinic

740
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,880
vouching registry

741
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,200
or alternatively or in addition to you

742
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,000
can

743
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,240
create or you can utilize rpks you can

744
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,360
create

745
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,678
rowers for your internet resources

746
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,520
but

747
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,760
as i mentioned one of the problems is

748
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,520
that network operators are not always

749
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,000
aware uh that they're originating or

750
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,080
propagating routing incidents

751
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,000
uh so this is where we

752
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,840
internet societies come in and invented

753
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,320
the well not invented that's developed

754
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,520
um the madness observatory um so this

755
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,039
the aim is to help

756
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,760
um networks identify and monitor where

757
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,080
they have these problems

758
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,880
now

759
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,399
if i had more time i would actually do a

760
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,840
live demo of this so this is just a

761
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,679
screenshot of these are just screenshots

762
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,640
uh

763
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,159
there's a lot that this observatory can

764
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,000
do but i really just wanted to raise

765
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,120
awareness of um uh of some of the things

766
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,080
that

767
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,200
that this

768
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,120
this tool can help with

769
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,360
so i'm at the moment i'm looking at uh

770
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,039
the whole of the continent of africa and

771
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,320
all of the networks that are registered

772
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,760
in africa

773
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,080
um and this is really showing how they

774
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,039
uh

775
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,000
how these networks meet the the four

776
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,919
which is really effectively five manas

777
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,279
actions so

778
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,360
um you know generally you don't see too

779
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,760
many routing incidents in africa

780
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,320
for various reasons africa is actually

781
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
in many respects quite good for routing

782
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,679
security

783
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,080
um we don't have too much information on

784
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,520
anti-spoofing because that's one of

785
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,559
these

786
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,080
things we can't measure passively we

787
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,799
need to actively measure that one

788
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,000
looks like all of the contact

789
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,240
information is up to date and then when

790
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,000
it comes to entering uh routes uh you

791
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,640
know in the irr um

792
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,640
you know obviously there's room for

793
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,360
improvement there um but africa does

794
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,880
globally quite well in terms of

795
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,440
registering its uh

796
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,760
routes in a irr

797
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,440
one area where it's perhaps a bit behind

798
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,480
globally is in uh rpki so the creation

799
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,960
of rowers for for those resources but

800
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,960
that's not hugely off the that the

801
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,360
global average there

802
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,480
so

803
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,320
we get this information from a number of

804
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,960
publicly available data sources um for

805
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,799
example bgp stream

806
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,120
the cider report which is provided by ap

807
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,159
nick labs um peering db is one of the

808
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,159
data sources uh keda and spoofer and

809
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,640
write that as well so this is collating

810
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,960
a number of different data sources

811
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,720
uh we can add to these data sources as

812
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,159
time progresses and that's what we hope

813
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,000
to do to improve

814
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,399
the quality of the data

815
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,159
but as well as um the dashboard overview

816
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,039
um

817
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,039
we can also drill down into the data for

818
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,080
each uh individual network um

819
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,919
so you can do this by

820
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,120
the whole of the internet you can do

821
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,840
this by africa you can do this by

822
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,000
subregion within different continents

823
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,760
like rar region and in fact you could do

824
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,000
this by individual country as well

825
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,919
um it's also possible to create custom

826
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,919
groups so a season could create a

827
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,240
constituency group and define all of the

828
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,399
asses that belong to its constituency

829
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,960
and you can use that to monitor your uh

830
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,240
conformance with

831
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,240
these routing security measures so it's

832
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,320
a pretty powerful thing

833
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,800
i've just got a screenshot of

834
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,000
[Music]

835
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,799
the african networks um this is just

836
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,039
this is in i think in order rough order

837
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,360
of of uh is

838
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,399
um

839
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,080
fortunately all of these are pretty

840
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,440
looking pretty good there's some that

841
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,960
aren't as good but i just showed you the

842
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
good ones uh i don't want to embarrass

843
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,519
anybody um

844
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,919
but it it it um

845
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,440
what you can also do is although this

846
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,200
gives you the sort of overview scores

847
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,799
you can also drill down

848
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,720
um into the data

849
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,440
um and get some finer

850
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,960
information so

851
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,480
you can actually look at where the exact

852
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,480
browsing incident is you can look at

853
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,200
where spoof data has come from um you

854
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,240
can look at the path through the

855
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,320
internet where you've received a route

856
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,200
leak

857
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,880
um so there's quite a lot you can do and

858
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,519
get that actual information

859
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,279
so the aggregated data can actually be

860
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,519
viewed by anybody

861
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,039
but the individual

862
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,120
network data does require a

863
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,799
login

864
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,960
but we are actually happy to offer

865
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,240
seasons an account well accredited certs

866
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,120
um

867
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,039
an account that can provide access to

868
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,720
the data for all of their

869
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,799
uh constituencies if they're interested

870
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,320
we'd be very happy to do that

871
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,799
and whilst this isn't

872
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,080
directly related to the tool itself um

873
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,240
we're really keen to see seasons getting

874
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,120
involved in routing security issues um

875
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,480
it's not something that's traditionally

876
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,720
part of a c cert portfolio um

877
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,080
but there's a number of ways in which

878
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,640
you can get involved in russian security

879
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,159
i'm not going to go through all of these

880
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,600
in the interest of time

881
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,000
i think these slides will be available

882
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,679
uh but certainly the mental observatory

883
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,720
is a really useful tool for looking at

884
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,159
and monitoring the routing situation

885
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,320
within your constituencies so again i

886
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,640
would reiterate that

887
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,039
we're happy to offer accounts

888
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,720
if you're interested in more information

889
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,159
please go to

890
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,159
www.manus.org

891
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,559
and if you're interested in looking at

892
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,159
the observatory

893
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,519
again that that

894
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,960
most of this information is publicly

895
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,320
available

896
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,760
you can look at that at

897
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,760
servitry.menos.org

898
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,320
so with that

899
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,559
i would like to take any questions if

900
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,960
there are any

901
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,480

00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,040
cares.cc

933
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,240
of korea internet and security agency

934
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,200
it's a great pleasure to take

935
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,960
part of this first african and arab

936
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,160
regional symposium

937
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,160
today i'd like to talk about cyber

938
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,240
exercises as a scissor success story

939
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,440
my my presentation has two parts the

940
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,000
introduction of the cyber exercise

941
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,440
conducted by cares of tcc

942
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,040
ap cert

943
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,599
my token is not that technical and it is

944
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,119
very simple and easy

945
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,720
careset cc is the national center for

946
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,400
the private sector

947
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,480
in south korea

948
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,960
our main activities can be largely

949
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,560
divided into

950
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,800
prevention response

951
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,839
recovery analysis and cooperation as

952
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,640
part of our cyber threat prevention

953
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:04,000
activities we conduct cyber exercise

954
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,000
often small and medium size the business

955
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,280
do not

956
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,960
have the budget or

957
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,280
human resources to conduct service

958
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,280
exercise on their own

959
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,760
now as of 2019 there were 6.8

960
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,320
million small medium-sized

961
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,599
enterprises registered in south korea

962
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,200
that is why cares at tcc conduct cyber

963
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,078
exercises focusing on these businesses

964
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,760
the exercise includes responding to

965
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,800
phishing emails data's attack response

966
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,839
and for some participating companies

967
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,240
we conduct a penetration test

968
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,599
this is a screenshot

969
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,560
from an actual phishing email response

970
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,119
exercise

971
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,240
also this slide shows you the effects of

972
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,720
phishing email response exercise

973
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,839
it can be seen that the click rate for

974
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,640
phishing emails is higher for new

975
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,599
participating companies than for

976
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,520
companies that have

977
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,640
participated in the past exercises

978
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,680
but the exercise is held once in the

979
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,720
first

980
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,920
half and once in the second half of the

981
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,960
year

982
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,160
comparing the first and second half

983
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,520
exercise

984
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,560
the click

985
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,520
rate in the second half is lower than

986
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,040
the first

987
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,640
half

988
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,599
for

989
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,400
our data center response exercise we

990
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,800
expect participating companies

991
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,440
experience ddos attack on their running

992
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,560
websites

993
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,200
than being prepared for this kind of

994
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,320
attack might be in the future

995
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,240
for penetration test

996
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,280
we aim that participating companies take

997
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,560
security measures on finding

998
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,560
vulnerabilities

999
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,040
all right second the cyber exercise of

1000
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,000
ap search

1001
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,839
episode is like the

1002
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,800
africa third of asia pacific region

1003
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,000
i'm on the ap circus training committee

1004
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,200
and the

1005
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,280
membership working group convener as

1006
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,359
well as the member of

1007
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,599
cyber drill working group this year i am

1008
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,079
also leading the drill working group

1009
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,359
ap 30 cyber exercise is held once a year

1010
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,079
and is done through the cooperation of

1011
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,280
the dread working group

1012
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,480
episode is not just for one country or

1013
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,000
one organization

1014
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
for this reason the voluntary

1015
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,960
cooperation of members becomes the

1016
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,839
foundation to support the cyber exercise

1017
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,000
there are a total of 12 teams in the

1018
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,400
drill working group each team prepares

1019
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,079
the infrastructures develops artifacts

1020
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,800
and scenarios and etc and etc

1021
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,480
it takes at least five months to prepare

1022
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,200
conduct and report the result for the

1023
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,400
exercise

1024
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,839
each team has their own job and the five

1025
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,280
month for

1026
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,680
the cyber drill cannot be done by a

1027
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,720
single team or single person so that is

1028
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,280
why the division of work among working

1029
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,839
group members is very important

1030
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,480
let me take the example of the cyber

1031
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,040
exercise in

1032
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,000
2021 now the theme was responding to

1033
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,760
supply chain attack

1034
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,880
targeting work from home environment a

1035
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,320
total of 27 organizations from 21

1036
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,280
countries including two african cert

1037
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,400
members participated thank you very much

1038
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,119
the scenario and artifact development

1039
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,720
was led by

1040
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,319
krs.cc

1041
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,520
and development to uh development took

1042
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,280
about three months

1043
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,920
reviewing and finalizing the injects

1044
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,430
with

1045
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,119
[Music]

1046
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,920
all members also took about one month uh

1047
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,720
this three is a kind of

1048
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,040
a table top exercise with a scripted

1049
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,319
scenario

1050
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,319
tysart worked on

1051
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,760
the rt system to send out the injects

1052
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,079
and htk cert on the irc of application

1053
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,720
and domain and ip addresses

1054
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,240
the guidance was made by also queensland

1055
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,520
university cert of australia

1056
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,520
and the cyber exercise training was

1057
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,880
conducted by tw insert all other members

1058
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,119
also participated in this

1059
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,079
scenarios and provided valuable reviews

1060
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:04,960
and

1061
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,680
feedback

1062
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,359
conducting a cyber exercise is not small

1063
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,920
task and it is not a test just for the

1064
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,359
working group

1065
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,000
most of the participants evaluated the

1066
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,400
cyber exercise positively

1067
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,319
and many express

1068
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:26,000
their intent to party participate

1069
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,359
again

1070
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,240
only when the participating teams play

1071
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,040
their roles as players the exercise can

1072
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,480
be successful

1073
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,119
and we can achieve the original purpose

1074
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,359
of strengthening

1075
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,160
cyber threat response capabilities of

1076
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,759
our member organizations

1077
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,040
it is the responsibility of ap cert

1078
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,160
operational members to

1079
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,240
participate in the cyber drill

1080
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,040
whether you are a player a member of a

1081
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,480
working group

1082
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,280
or an exercise controller or

1083
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,720
on object bar everyone's cooperation is

1084
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,359
required in order to conduct a drill

1085
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,319
successfully so creating and sending out

1086
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,760
inject is

1087
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,520
of no use if no one solves them

1088
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,000
and even if you have a scenario you

1089
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,800
don't you can't do anything without the

1090
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,920
infrastructures to send out the inject

1091
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,480
it is the cooperation and participation

1092
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,920
of all f member countries that make

1093
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,160
cyberspace safe

1094
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,760
making sure of my safety is the way to

1095
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,400
not cause harm to others

1096
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,079
the other way around is also true the ap

1097
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,119
certain cares at cc i will continue to

1098
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,480
strive to strengthen the capabilities of

1099
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,760
our member

1100
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,240
organizations and my country through

1101
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,279
cyber exercise

1102
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,640
okay this is the end of my presentation

1103
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,440
and thank you kamsamnita i'm handing

1104
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,319
over

1105
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,280
to the mic handing over microphone to

1106
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,319
the professional view

1107
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,839
thank you very much you for this

1108
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,800
presentation and i think

1109
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,880
to return to weapons institute sure you

1110
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,640
will use a lot of open source tools to

1111
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,160
conduct such

1112
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,920
exercises

1113
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,400
so now we have

1114
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,760
we have

1115
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,480
five minutes for question

1116
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,359
uh

1117
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,520
please guys if you have any questions

1118
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,960
through the qrs section you can ask

1119
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,880
your question or we can

1120
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,640
maybe i have a question for omu

1121
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,240
since

1122
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,359
yes

1123
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,120
professor nabil

1124
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,150
[Music]

1125
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,839
professor nobel are you still there

1126
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,800
oh

1127
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,599
see it looks like oh professor nabeel

1128
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,640
yeah i lose my connection

1129
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,599
you're back i don't know what happened

1130
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:28,480
uh

1131
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,359
i don't know if um heard my question or

1132
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,119
should i repeat

1133
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,960
uh please repeat yeah

1134
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,280
i just wanted uh since you have a very

1135
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,280
strategic position

1136
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,520
and relationship with universities and

1137
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,880
so on

1138
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,359
which strategy

1139
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,000
is there any strategy is that any action

1140
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,280
to push

1141
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,480
that during education you know for

1142
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,960
the teaching for engineers and so on

1143
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,599
we're more focused on teaching on open

1144
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,560
source tools as it should be because we

1145
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,880
cannot touch with commercial tools at

1146
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,800
the university

1147
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,760
for format making marketing for anyone

1148
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,160
and if there is a push for some research

1149
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,160
development activity to you know

1150
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,640
customize some tools integrate some

1151
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,680
tools

1152
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,000
to better protect the infrastructure of

1153
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,359
those networks

1154
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
precisely

1155
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,160
i sort of touched slightly on it in my

1156
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,000
last slide talking about open

1157
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,200
initiatives so basically the work we do

1158
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,160
within the research networks

1159
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,359
is based on open technology

1160
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,760
unless where it is not possible

1161
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,800
for some for whatever operational reason

1162
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,920
so they go to is open source or open

1163
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,400
platforms and that's not just um

1164
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,520
within uh certain networks you know even

1165
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,359
with the scholarly platforms that we are

1166
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,280
starting to

1167
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,280
deploy

1168
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,359
in some countries we are looking at

1169
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,359
shared platforms they're all open source

1170
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,079
so

1171
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,960
the the issue of security has become

1172
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,760
really uh forefront which is why trust

1173
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,520
broker africa was uh

1174
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,079
was always in the in the front bunner so

1175
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,240
yes the answer to that is yes

1176
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,880
uh but saying that you know there's

1177
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,599
still

1178
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,599
a need to

1179
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,599
collaborate to sort of

1180
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,560
realize the the aspiration

1181
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,160
so i cannot you know i cannot

1182
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,000
overemphasize that especially within

1183
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,200
this area

1184
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,640
so we're looking for

1185
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,800
uh we're hoping that the models that we

1186
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,400
you know that we're looking at you know

1187
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,119
so

1188
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,720
because the national sets and the enrons

1189
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,800
are both national structures

1190
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,680
that there is a natural synergy there

1191
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,800
but yes i'd be happy to

1192
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,200
associate with existing

1193
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,359
collaboration on any open initiative

1194
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:57,240
that drives the agenda

1195
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,119
thank you

1196
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,960
is there any question also from the

1197
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,520
speaker if you want

1198
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,560
we should move to the second

1199
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,880
track of the

1200
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,720
session

1201
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,040
which will focus on open source students

1202
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,319
so

1203
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:21,200
maybe we should

1204
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,079
if it's hello to me i have a few couple

1205
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,200
of uh

1206
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,760
of slides to just

1207
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,160
focus on the interest of open source

1208
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,960
once i see its activity

1209
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,440
since we have no question

1210
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,720
we can do that rapidly

1211
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,839
is it

1212
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:54,640
okay just to talk about uh for office

1213
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,319
here to what's happening for the seat

1214
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,000
why open source is very interesting

1215
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,240
especially for african species because

1216
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,040
when we go to build these seats the

1217
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,839
costs come from equipment

1218
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,400
some pc server and some other fancy

1219
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,119
tools but the most massive cars come

1220
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,920
from software tools

1221
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,839
so that's the

1222
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:19,040
the problem is that listens three are

1223
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,160
big and are records and here we have to

1224
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,200
pay

1225
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,319
again for annual maintenance street

1226
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:29,920
so how to delay this big cost center

1227
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,079
and especially in our country all we all

1228
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,680
know is that

1229
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,000
we have painful and long administrative

1230
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,880
acquisition procedures that delay really

1231
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,400
the start of a new third of the

1232
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,040
a

1233
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,400
upgrade of uh iranic scissors

1234
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,240
and also to be able to more invest in

1235
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,839
capacity building on training on human

1236
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,040
let's say

1237
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,359
and for the founding associate activity

1238
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,760
knowing that we have little budget in

1239
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,960
fact

1240
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,000
for

1241
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,079
houses yet insisted in fact we need a

1242
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,800
very strong associated security

1243
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,319
architecture

1244
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:09,530
since we will be you know

1245
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,359
[Music]

1246
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,240
saved by hackers

1247
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,960
so we need to create cardinal

1248
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,720
quantitative also completeness of

1249
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,079
deployed solution inside our contractor

1250
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,480
our network

1251
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,559
we need tools for implementing effective

1252
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:28,480
process services you know incident

1253
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,880
handling and so on relevant warning and

1254
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,800
so on

1255
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,359
we need for virus and methi platform we

1256
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:39,880
get an investigation and foreign

1257
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,640
and so on but we need various

1258
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,839
tools

1259
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:51,200
so very big budget expensive relations

1260
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,839
especially

1261
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,040
that's why the solution is use of open

1262
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,040
source since we have

1263
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,119
zero license

1264
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,680
if we choose to accompany what we have

1265
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,280
as conversation we must have commercial

1266
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,079
i will not say exclusively open source

1267
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,800
tool that

1268
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,400
of course but also southward available

1269
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,559
we have respect of standard we have very

1270
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,040
good glory and very good community

1271
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,240
assistance

1272
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,480
we have plenty sometimes better than

1273
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,480
commercial solutions

1274
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,839
but if you want

1275
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,480
you know assistance starting we can do

1276
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,960
it for the

1277
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:50,240
the window is

1278
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,839
closing so please move

1279
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:55,920
fast people will say open source is not

1280
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,760
supposed because the code is can be

1281
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,640
solved by anyone

1282
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,640
believe me that no software

1283
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:09,118
so the lines of safety of source

1284
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,359
have better support in light

1285
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,400
you have the assistance of and very

1286
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,640
philanthropic and rich and friendly from

1287
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,319
the community

1288
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:31,280
but also if you want to you know

1289
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,520
assistance you can do what you have you

1290
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,480
know

1291
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,720
contact your cheap people for training

1292
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,480
assistance and so on from the most

1293
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,119
circumstances

1294
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,640
so

1295
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,720
the last slide would be that

1296
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:49,558
the free access to south carolina

1297
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,400
and by customizing and extending

1298
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,520
you know

1299
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,480
source in fact when we master deployment

1300
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,079
remastered tools

1301
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,839
we can go a pd to such

1302
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:05,839
activity also you are a legal provider

1303
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:08,480
for the solution when you go to under a

1304
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,680
resident

1305
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,839
in your constitution

1306
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,480
especially in our country you find the

1307
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,200
very existence of the situation

1308
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,000
open source permit you to at least

1309
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,640
provide the basic protection to those

1310
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,720
guys without any

1311
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,240
legally you know

1312
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,240
unless very interesting

1313
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,079
impact consultations

1314
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,640
thank you i think i finished it

1315
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,880
i wanted to

1316
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,800
fill the gaps and maybe we go

1317
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,880
to the second

1318
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,920
[Music]

1319
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,920
track

1320
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:58,640
so maybe we go rapidly to the second

1321
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,540
track and

1322
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,160
[Music]

1323
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,680
in fact

1324
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,280
we have four

1325
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,800
speakers

1326
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,559
and very interesting speech

1327
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,040
and maybe we'll start immediately with

1328
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,079
uh

1329
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,920

00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,799
in africa

1340
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,880
thank you for the introduction maybe and

1341
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,079
thank you for all the organizers

1342
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:22,880
for the amazing preparation for this

1343
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,480
event so indeed i work

1344
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,319
at 36lm the sisters of excellium a

1345
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:33,200
company based in luxembourg

1346
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,760
and we also intervened in africa through

1347
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,480
subsidiary or surrey

1348
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,680
so today we will deal with

1349
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,119
office 365 and azure more precisely with

1350
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,920
the business he may compromise

1351
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,280
as this

1352
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,359
kind of incident

1353
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,359
occurs more and more

1354
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:55,920
and i will present how

1355
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,040
we deal with it in my team

1356
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,960
the toolbox we want

1357
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,720
that we want to be as small as possible

1358
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,559
and

1359
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:07,839
also

1360
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:09,119
reliable

1361
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:10,960
to collect

1362
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,000
to and to pass and automate

1363
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,200
the log zone

1364
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,799
to get insights

1365
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:20,880
about the attacker activities

1366
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,079
and to give a bit a bit of context in a

1367
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,880
certain incident we will

1368
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,920
we will

1369
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,680
we will

1370
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,480
expect and to find the root cause how

1371
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,640
the attacker gets in

1372
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,520
uh

1373
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,599
how what the attacker did the extent of

1374
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,480
the compromise and of course to get the

1375
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,119
attacker out of the information system

1376
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:45,359
so to contain and

1377
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,480
and to recover from it and in the

1378
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,599
context of

1379
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,960
office 365 and azero

1380
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,680
it adds a lot of complexity

1381
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,040
i listed some of them here

1382
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,000
but there is certainly lots of others we

1383
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,960
don't know yet about

1384
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,319
and

1385
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:08,079
this is even more difficult given the

1386
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:11,040
complexity of the platform

1387
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,839
just to get to depict a bit there is

1388
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:16,640
more than 15 admin consoles so you can

1389
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,720
imagine the redundancy of the

1390
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,559
configuration

1391
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:21,599
and

1392
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,440
and the multiple

1393
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,119
pages you have to

1394
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,920
browse to to ensure your config

1395
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,920
configuration is correct

1396
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,839
you have also complexity with the

1397
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:33,440
listening thing

1398
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,720
depending uh on your your

1399
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,720
listens you will not have the same blog

1400
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,599
retention the same security features

1401
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,839
so it will be difficult to more or less

1402
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:47,280
difficult to investigate you also have

1403
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,960
and we will uh

1404
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,200
dig a dig inside this

1405
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,720
in the in the next slide the

1406
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,200
variety of logs

1407
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,359
and depending on how you collect them

1408
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:01,520
you don't have the same results you have

1409
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,599
not the same limitation you don't have

1410
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,839
the same fields in the logs the same

1411
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,119
information

1412
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:09,920
sometimes you also have latency

1413
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,799
and sometimes also you have simply love

1414
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:14,640
the corrupted

1415
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,400
just by design

1416
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,880
from from microsoft

1417
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,559
and also

1418
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:23,040
it's the cloud so it's not only web

1419
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,079
services it's also

1420
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,559
authentication protocols and if you use

1421
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:29,760
some

1422
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,319
old ones

1423
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:35,040
you are you can expect some multi-factor

1424
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,520
authentication bypass there is also the

1425
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,040
notions of

1426
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,760
oauth applications

1427
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,000
it's a new form of phishing because

1428
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,119
instead of

1429
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:47,839
just inviting the user to enter his

1430
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,119
credentials on the phishing webpage

1431
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,200
it's the legitimate pop-up from

1432
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,520
microsoft to enter credentials just to

1433
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,319
give

1434
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:58,559
authorization to an application and this

1435
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,360
authorization can be

1436
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,839
[Music]

1437
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:03,359
reading an email

1438
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:06,400
fetching the address book writing email

1439
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,880
impersonating the user so

1440
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,920
it's uh it's a new new phishing and it's

1441
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,640
hard for end users to uh to detect it

1442
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,799
and you also have uh

1443
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:19,680
the the notion of guest partner access

1444
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:24,079
which defaults are just open to everyone

1445
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:25,130
users can also

1446
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:27,599
[Music]

1447
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:28,480
add

1448
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,200
some application in office online and

1449
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,119
there is no logs about this

1450
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,200
and there is also the feature to share

1451
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,720
documents with uh

1452
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,440
with someone

1453
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,880
so back to

1454
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,319
back to the focus of the token

1455
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:46,720
the logs we are interested in in the

1456
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,640
case of a business may compromise

1457
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,599
incidents we want to see the logins of

1458
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:52,960
the user

1459
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,480
we want to see

1460
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,920
the the

1461
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,760
activity of the user

1462
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,960
so all of this is contained in the

1463
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,160
what is called azure id sign in the

1464
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,960
risky user and sign in represents the

1465
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,559
the

1466
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,400
artificial intelligence added by

1467
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,799
microsoft it can provide great insight

1468
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:15,920
too

1469
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,640
the azure ad audit logs on represent

1470
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,520
sorry i have some troubles with the chat

1471
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,839
okay i'm

1472
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:34,880
back so the idea ideo det logs represent

1473
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,680
the activity on user groups

1474
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,240
and the famous applications

1475
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,640
so but only the management part user

1476
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,760
created permission added and so on

1477
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:46,920
the

1478
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,400
o36365 audit logs represent will contain

1479
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,200
the attacker activity also but on the

1480
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,200
applications like

1481
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,319
onedrive

1482
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:59,520
the exchange mailbox and so on

1483
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,839
then we we are we have also we are

1484
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:04,400
interested in the message crest report

1485
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,799
meaning all the message

1486
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:09,440
sent and recited by a user

1487
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,359
and the

1488
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:14,319
the the registered application to figure

1489
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,880
out if there is some rogue ones

1490
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,440
and which permission they have

1491
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,920
so depending on your license you can

1492
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,760
fetch them through the graphical

1493
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,640
interface or from powershell and we will

1494
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,480
prefer powershell because

1495
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,599
we want

1496
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,200
reliable logs

1497
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,040
so that we can script

1498
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,000
we we have homogeneous results if when

1499
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,319
you use the the graphical interface it's

1500
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,400
like it was observed we observe that

1501
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,040
it's not always okay we also have a

1502
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,880
better retention from the graphical

1503
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,200
interface sometimes you can only extract

1504
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,319
one month

1505
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:52,319
while there is three months retention

1506
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,160
from powershell we are sure that

1507
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,599
we are sure that the logs are not

1508
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:58,799
corrupted

1509
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:01,359
because sometimes it's a csv format with

1510
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:04,160
a json nested inside so

1511
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,640
the json is sometimes corrupted from the

1512
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,400
graphical interface

1513
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,960
and also it is the mentioned in the

1514
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,280
official documentation that

1515
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,200
in the graphical interface you might

1516
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,119
have 24 hours

1517
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:18,640
between the

1518
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,640
activity so imagine a login from the

1519
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,119
attacker and the time you see it in the

1520
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:25,440
graphical interface with with powershell

1521
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,640
you don't have this limitation

1522
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,400
so let's move on now

1523
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,599
in each of these

1524
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,240
these logs to figure out how we deal

1525
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,280
with open source tools to reliably

1526
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,280
extract them

1527
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,480
taking into also into account that the

1528
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,280
client might not be familiar with it so

1529
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,960
with progression commands there is lots

1530
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,319
of options so we wanted a way to always

1531
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:54,799
get the same log the same

1532
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:56,400
level of details

1533
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,440
in logs

1534
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,240
even if the the client

1535
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,039
is not familiar with with the tool

1536
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:04,400
and so for this

1537
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,200
we've we found this uh this great

1538
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,240
framework from the ansi the nationalism

1539
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,039
the french national agency

1540
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,559
uh

1541
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:17,680
with which it is as simple as getting

1542
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,920
the start and the end of logs we want

1543
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,799
and execute that's all in command line

1544
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:24,079
in powershell

1545
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:26,799
so this is to extract and as you can see

1546
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:28,319
on the right

1547
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:29,599
you have

1548
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:31,119
lots of

1549
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:33,440
lots of information lots of k in the

1550
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,440
json

1551
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,160
so

1552
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,839
simply with the jquery command line tool

1553
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,520
you can extract

1554
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,640
in a

1555
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,039
in a csv because it's easier to build a

1556
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:47,520
timeline for these events

1557
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,400
the only the career you

1558
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,559
you are interested in so this is the

1559
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,720
example we have for the signing love the

1560
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,680
login

1561
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,240
of the attacker and especially what is

1562
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,440
important in this information is the app

1563
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,079
id and the resource id

1564
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:06,319
in the language in the world of

1565
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:09,200
microsoft the app id is the source

1566
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,000
from which the the attacker logged in

1567
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,920
so it can be a

1568
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,799
web login it can be from a powershell it

1569
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:18,559
can be from outlook

1570
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:20,559
and the resource id which is the

1571
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:23,280
destination so you know

1572
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,079
where

1573
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:26,640
which interfaces the attacker could log

1574
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,799
in

1575
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,160
and from uh for audit logs so all

1576
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,920
related to the user management if

1577
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,200
attacker created a new user if he uh

1578
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,319
if he escalated his privilege and so on

1579
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:42,400
we use the same framework the same

1580
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,920
module

1581
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,280
which i would put uh in json2

1582
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,880
and in in fact it is the exact same uh

1583
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,920
command as a as for logins it's all

1584
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,160
bundled in the same command

1585
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,440
and then you have an easy way to uh to

1586
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,280
script

1587
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,440
with a gq

1588
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,960
to to extract an overview of what the

1589
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,039
attacker did so

1590
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:10,319
the user

1591
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:13,839
was operated initiated by user principal

1592
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:16,880
name and the activity display name

1593
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,359
and this gives you this will give you a

1594
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:21,839
quick overview of the attacker activity

1595
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:23,680
and then you will have to build a

1596
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,079
timeline for each different activity

1597
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:27,039
name

1598
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:28,880
i give an example

1599
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,880
with the activity constant to an

1600
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,240
application so if the compromised user

1601
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,000
was used to uh

1602
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,839
to to register a new application a wrong

1603
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:42,079
application and the difficulty is that

1604
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,960
the fields of interest is different for

1605
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,280
each different activity

1606
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,760
for instance for consumption application

1607
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,839
you will be interested in the activity

1608
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:55,440
date time the ip address the user and

1609
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,520
the target of what was consented to

1610
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,440
which application

1611
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,440
and if you

1612
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,440
if you spot another malicious activity

1613
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,359
from the attacker you will have to

1614
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:06,839
filter with a

1615
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:10,480
select on the name of this activity and

1616
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:11,920
then

1617
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,799
mention the instead of field one three

1618
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:16,559
two the

1619
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:17,680
the field

1620
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,400
that is that are interesting here for

1621
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,200
for this for this activity but at least

1622
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,280
you have a command line tool

1623
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,010
which

1624
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:27,440
[Music]

1625
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,839
with which you can automate the

1626
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:33,119
extraction of insight

1627
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:35,200
the same applies for application

1628
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,760
register so to list all of them on the

1629
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,520
challenge yes if you allow me to

1630
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,200
interrupt you could you go faster

1631
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,280
because you we go

1632
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,280
really out of time

1633
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,720
you move

1634
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:50,319
uh i guess it's not always

1635
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:55,200
with all the information so it is the

1636
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,000
same for application registered with the

1637
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,760
with the same module

1638
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,520
simple as simple as

1639
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,079
getting mentioning the start dates and

1640
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:08,480
data you need

1641
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,280
and

1642
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,839
if you want to filter on only some users

1643
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,760
so you can specify the emails of the

1644
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,799
users

1645
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:17,359
and it is always the same with gq to

1646
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:18,720
automate this

1647
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,319
with message track report it's a bit

1648
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:21,920
different because we need the graphical

1649
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,000
interface

1650
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,160
and there is some some surprise that

1651
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,599
microsoft

1652
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,200
will embed for you

1653
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:33,839
so to summarize you have a powerful

1654
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:36,720
framework with with from ansi

1655
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,400
to handle

1656
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,680
the the commercial command to handle the

1657
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,880
token refresh the apl throttling

1658
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,520
and the limited number of results per

1659
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,720
query so only this is bundled in this

1660
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,359
framework and simple to use for a client

1661
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:55,760
and you will get stable

1662
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,839
stable logs

1663
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:00,720
to then pass and automate the the

1664
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,240
extraction of

1665
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:05,119
attacker activity

1666
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:07,039
i would like to highlight the three

1667
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:07,920
known

1668
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,599
cavets

1669
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:11,760
in

1670
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:14,240
microsoft logs the first is regarding

1671
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,520
the login

1672
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,680
be prepared that it's hard to identify

1673
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,160
the primary connection of the attacker

1674
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,559
when you connect to a web interface one

1675
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:25,200
login will generate around 30 lines of

1676
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,200
blocks so it's difficult

1677
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,359
the three edge is difficult and the

1678
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:31,839
application ide are not always listed

1679
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,280
for the tenants there is also some

1680
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,520
internal id that are not documented by

1681
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,319
microsoft so to detect work works it can

1682
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:40,480
be quite quite a mess

1683
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,640
and the message press report are not

1684
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,680
nothing

1685
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,079
always exhaustive

1686
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:49,599
so that's all for me

1687
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:52,720
thank you thank you very much

1688
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,000
for this

1689
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,119
very interesting sharing of experiences

1690
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:58,880
that show the

1691
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:02,559
power of open source tools managing also

1692
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:04,480
complex incidents

1693
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,839
i'm sorry

1694

1704
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:42,080
and we share his detailed cv via

1705
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,560
zoom chat the cv available on the

1706
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,600
website please

1707
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:50,799
hi all do you hear me well

1708
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:52,799
yeah we are thank you

1709
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:55,359
it's a pleasure to meet you all

1710
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:57,198
thanks professor napier

1711
01:08:57,198 --> 01:08:59,439
i'm gonna talk uh

1712
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:01,120
briefly about

1713
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,719
the agenda

1714
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:04,000
so let's

1715
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,319
get in depth

1716
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:08,560
the agendas starts with the incident

1717
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,479
life cycle then

1718
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,319
in the preparation phase and analysis

1719
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,799
phase the tools open source tools we use

1720
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:16,640
in this phases

1721
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,080
so let's go with the incident life cycle

1722
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,560
based on nests

1723
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,158
the standards it's our life cycles

1724
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:29,040
continuous four phases starting with the

1725
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,679
preparation then second cycle goes with

1726
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:33,679
identification and analysis

1727
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:36,560
then third cycle goes with containment

1728
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,279
eradication and recovery and finally

1729
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:42,080
lesson learning preparation we will go

1730
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,158
with the preparation tools it's mainly

1731
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:46,238
about the tools and the

1732
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:49,520
behavior of the of the technical people

1733
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,679
and preparing all of this

1734
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:53,839
so what's the most

1735
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:56,480
important tools we use in the

1736
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,400
preparation phase

1737
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,280
actually we have two the hive project

1738
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,199
and rtir

1739
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,600
the hive project actually is a scalable

1740
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,159
open source and free security engine

1741
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:10,320
response platform

1742
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,560
designed to make life easier for sock

1743
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,560
c-shirt and certs

1744
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,960
the hive consists of two parts cortex

1745
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,280
which is a powerful observable analysis

1746
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,360
and active response engine

1747
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,480
so observables such as id email address

1748
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,440
urls domain names file or hashes can be

1749
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,159
analyzed using a web interface

1750
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,000
also analysts can

1751
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,320
automate this operation and submit large

1752
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,960
set of observable from the hive project

1753
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,400
through cortex rest apis

1754
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,120
and for rtir which is a ticketing system

1755
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,679
based on request tracker incident

1756
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:47,199
response

1757
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:49,360
actually it's an enterprise grade

1758
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,040
tracking system it allows the

1759
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,640
organization to keep track of what

1760
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,960
needed to get done who is working on

1761
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,880
which task and what's already been done

1762
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,600
rtir is built on all the features of

1763
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,719
request tracker rt and provides provides

1764
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,719
pre-configured cues and workflows

1765
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:09,280
designed for instant response teams

1766
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,360
it's the tools of choice for many short

1767
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,120
and teaser teams all over the globe

1768
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:19,360
rtar also has a dedicated internet

1769
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,320
dashboard with pre-pedaled listed of

1770
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,120
most

1771
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,520
due tickets also it can search tickets

1772
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,760
on any metadata attributes

1773
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,960
including like status dates linked user

1774
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,920
and custom fields

1775
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,800
this is for the preparation phase and we

1776
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,920
will go with the analysis phase

1777
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,000
we have many tools

1778
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,360
used

1779
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,159
first we will talk about grr which is

1780
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:51,280
google rapid response

1781
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,440
it's an incident response framework

1782
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,080
focused on remote life forensics

1783
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,560
the goal of grrr is to support forensic

1784
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,560
and investigation in a fast scalable

1785
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,040
manner to allow analysts to quickly

1786
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,120
triage attacks and perform analysis

1787
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,880
remotely

1788
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,960
grrr consists of two bars client and

1789
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,159
server

1790
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,239
the client is deployed on systems at one

1791
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:14,080
mindfulness investigate

1792
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,920
so once deployed grrr client

1793
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,239
periodically pulls grr front-end server

1794
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:21,120
for work and by work i mean running a

1795
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,600
specific action downloading file listing

1796
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,840
a directory etc

1797
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,080
the other part is a server which

1798
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,840
consists of several components that

1799
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,000
allow analysts to schedule actions on

1800
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,159
clients and view process collected data

1801
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:38,480
actually grr was built to run at scale

1802
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,159
so the analysts are capable of

1803
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:42,080
effectively collecting and processing

1804
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:45,840
data from large number of machines

1805
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,400
and also a most important tool we use is

1806
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,760
volatility

1807
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:53,280
which is used for memory forensics

1808
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,080
volatility is a command line

1809
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,280
tool uh it's already developed too much

1810
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,080
well

1811
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,920
and it has a forensic tool for

1812
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,040
extracting artifacts from memory dam

1813
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:08,000
it can analyze road arms crash dumb

1814
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,760
vmware dumb

1815
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,960
virtual box dump and many others

1816
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,440
in many cases critical data pertaining

1817
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,640
to attack

1818
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,040
or threats will exist only in system

1819
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,719
memory

1820
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:23,280
including network connections account

1821
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,520
credential

1822
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,640
shared messages encryption keys

1823
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,400
running process

1824
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,040
injected code fragments

1825
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,440
internet history

1826
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,840
uh anything that's non-cachable in the

1827
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,320
machine itself on the hard disk

1828
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,320
so any program malicious or otherwise

1829
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,719
must be loaded in memory to execute

1830
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:47,120
so making forensics memory forensic

1831
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,320
critical for identifying the otherwise

1832
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,679
uh obvestigated attack

1833
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,360
then we will go with the sys internals

1834
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,280
actually system internals

1835
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,480
was developed

1836
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,080
by microsoft

1837
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:05,440
teams and joined microsoft which helped

1838
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,040
administrator and developer in their

1839
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,159
activity

1840
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:10,239
but over the years multiple capabilities

1841
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:12,000
have been added and tools have been

1842
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,080
created to add malware analysis in

1843
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,320
finding malicious behavior

1844
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,400
so since this internal suite contains

1845
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,960
more than 70 tools so we will go fast

1846
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,360
with most important tools so let's start

1847
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,480
with like

1848
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:27,280
something called autoruns

1849
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,199
has the most comprehensive knowledge of

1850
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:31,360
auto start location of any startup

1851
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,520
monitor shows you what program are

1852
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,600
configured to run during system boot up

1853
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,280
or login

1854
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,679
something like prog dump which is a

1855
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:42,000
processor dump a command line also

1856
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,320
utility which primary purpose is

1857
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,000
monitoring an application

1858
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,400
for cpu spikes and generating crash

1859
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,800
dumps during a spike

1860
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,719
something like process monitor is the

1861
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:54,400
gui

1862
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,679
from proc dump also for windows to show

1863
01:14:57,679 --> 01:14:59,920
real lifetime system registry and

1864
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,480
process threat activity

1865
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:05,199
something also like cesmon which is a

1866
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:08,159
windows system service and device driver

1867
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:09,920
that once uninstalled in system remain

1868
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,520
resilient across system reports to

1869
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,440
monitor unlock system activity on

1870
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,839
windows

1871
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:19,760
also for process explorer it shows you

1872
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,920
information about which handles and dll

1873
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:26,640
process that have been opened or loaded

1874
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,320
lastly

1875
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,400
we will go with uh

1876
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,040
something that's very interesting which

1877
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,760
is sans poster it's uh

1878
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:39,360
not a tool but actually it gives us a

1879
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:42,239
full potential to see over the instant

1880
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:43,600
very well

1881
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,840
there is three posters which is the red

1882
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,239
poster which is talks about windows

1883
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:50,880
forensics and the blue poster which is

1884
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,360
talks about hunt evil and the black

1885
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:56,400
poster with eric zimmerman tools

1886
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,480
let's start with red poster it's a

1887
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,960
windows forensic analyst chichi

1888
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,199
used by analysts to easily investigate

1889
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,960
digital forensic cases

1890
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,719
using different categories like fire

1891
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:09,120
knowledge file deletion browser

1892
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,840
artifacts usb architects and so on

1893
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,719
zongo is a blue poster it has a

1894
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:17,920
known as no find evil no normal

1895
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,400
so by knowing what's normal on a wind's

1896
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,560
horse helps you cuts through to noise

1897
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,400
and noise to quickly locate potential

1898
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,679
malware

1899
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:27,760
it starts with the normal process and

1900
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,840
count of each process and the parent

1901
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,239
process and past for the process to

1902
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:35,040
easily investigate about wrong process

1903
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,280
the second page of the poster in the

1904
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,840
blue poster talks about lateral movement

1905
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,440
from the attacker and the evidence of

1906
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,520
execution

1907
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,840
the last one is a tool from someone

1908
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,600
called eric zimmerman which is a

1909
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,560
developer a really good developer has a

1910
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:53,440
world of data stored

1911
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,839
tools

1912
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:57,360
mainly its

1913
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,760
command line tools

1914
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:00,719
as

1915
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:04,320
eric government tools it's windows

1916
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,770
data stored very

1917
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:07,040
[Music]

1918
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,080
very much

1919
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,719
so if you uh encounter a sizeable hard

1920
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:12,800
drive it could be hours or even days

1921
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,840
before you are ready to even start your

1922
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:17,199
investigation so with eric zimmerman

1923
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,920
it's uh using descriptive scalable and

1924
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,000
repeatable results

1925
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,600
and has astonishing speed and accuracy

1926
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,800
so from one investigation to from

1927
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,239
weak it can takes or only hours to

1928
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:33,520
finish it

1929
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,360
there are many tools used to parse a lot

1930
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,080
of systems artifacts such as amp cache

1931
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,719
link files timeline explorer registry

1932
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:45,040
parser mft parser and so on

1933
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,199
thank you very much for the

1934
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:48,080
time

1935
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,040
i hope anyone asks anything i will be

1936
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:54,560
with you thank you very much

1937

this very interesting presentation which

1940
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:01,679
shows the power

1941
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:02,800
of

1942
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,480
open source tools to conduct

1943
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:08,000
investigation and also foreign

1944
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,320
thank you for this large spectrum of

1945
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,560
tools that show it

1946
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,560
i hope that is the question we have

1947
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,719
don't see questions in regular

1948
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:20,320
section please do also in french

1949

experience in conducting research and

1959
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:47,040
development activity using open source

1960
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,440
tools

1961
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:54,599
one building from 2006

1962
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,560
the

1963
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,520
security monitoring system

1964
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,560

yes we do yes okay thank you mr neby uh

1972
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,640
hello everyone today i'm going to

1973
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,960
present to you the server platform which

1974
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,199
is a cyber threat supervision platform

1975
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:33,440
visit mainly on open source tools

1976
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,320
um

1977
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:37,360
well uh center is a technical platform

1978
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,000
uh it's based on open source tools like

1979
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,920
we said in the beginning

1980
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,080
it's developed by the information

1981
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,719
sharing and analysis center team and

1982
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:51,400
treats return cyber attack monitoring

1983
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,239
center collects data from different

1984
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:55,360
sources

1985
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,840
like the different feeds ourselves and

1986
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,400
incident teams we proceed to the

1987
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,560
treatment and filtering of this data

1988
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,120
according to several criteria like

1989
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:08,000
urgent source the nature the types etc

1990
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,520
finally we share ioc or ttp

1991
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,840
which stands for tactic techniques and

1992
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:17,040
procedures with our teams and we publish

1993
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,560
a story

1994
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,120
and a publish awareness button through

1995
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,920
our channel we can also perform training

1996
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,040
sessions

1997
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:29,360
via cyber drill exercises

1998
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,560
serve has several components

1999
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,800
such as services availability

2000
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,679
supervision ip reputation detection of

2001
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:39,440
massive attacks

2002
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:43,360
behavior study of attackers and so on

2003
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:46,560
the majority of these components are

2004
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,440
developed from 100 percent open source

2005
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,280
tools such as

2006
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:52,159
um

2007
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:53,440
zabics

2008
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,199
which monitor the availability of

2009
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:56,960
services or

2010
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,639
sericata

2011
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:01,360
which helps in the detection of attacks

2012
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,760
some of these tools will be detailed in

2013
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:08,000
the training session of tomorrow

2014
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:08,780
um

2015
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,320
[Music]

2016
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,120
has also several feats but a lot that

2017
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:15,760
allows it to function properly most of

2018
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,440
these data sources

2019
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,520
are free of charge

2020
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,400
like shadow servers

2021
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,360
which reports blacklisted ip accessible

2022
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,360
rdp smb

2023
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,040
and other protocols

2024
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,480
zone h

2025
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:33,440
which reports defacement websites or

2026
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,719
fish tank with deals with phishing

2027
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:39,360
websites

2028
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,960
due to uh the time limitation i will

2029
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,920
take two examples which makes her

2030
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,320
a success story in tunisia and which are

2031
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,440
cer

2032
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:50,639
which are

2033
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:51,440
yes

2034
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,320
cerebral pet detection and server active

2035
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,960
monitoring

2036
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,880
i will start first with our botnet

2037
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,239
detection project the system is based on

2038
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:03,440
elk

2039
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:06,639
and consists of three main operations

2040
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:09,679
first we collect the

2041
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:12,159
log files from different dns servers

2042
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:14,960
located at different isps

2043
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:18,719
this raw data is huge and unfiltered so

2044
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:20,960
the next logical steps

2045
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,520
the next logical steps is to reduce the

2046
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,199
size and only keep meaningful entries

2047
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:29,280
in order to do this we compare the

2048
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,840
collected data with our

2049
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,679
database

2050
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:35,440
of malicious domain

2051
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,600
finally the output is displayed in

2052
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,480
various dashboards and monitoring by our

2053
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,960
sock team

2054
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,760
here a dashboard a screenshot

2055
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:48,239
of the botnet detection dashboard on the

2056
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:51,120
top we can find we can see the number of

2057
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,679
perfect per day the number of unique ip

2058
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:55,040
addresses

2059
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,920
and the total number of botnet

2060
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,920
here you can found

2061
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,000
or you can see the list of detected

2062
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,280
botnet

2063
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,040
sorted by the number of times the

2064
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,679
malicious domain has been visited

2065
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:09,770
in the bottom of the screen you can see

2066
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:10,880
[Music]

2067
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:13,520
a graph dividing the malicious domain as

2068
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,159
well as the details of malicious domains

2069
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:19,559
or botnet

2070
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,880
uh the next project is server active

2071
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,040
monitoring in this project we have

2072
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,280
deployed several sensors

2073
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,840
uh to monitor the network traffic of our

2074
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,400
partners and detect animations activity

2075
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,679
in real time

2076
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:36,639
the deploy now the deployed node

2077
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:39,360
synchronizes with our master node

2078
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:42,159
hosted in in our data center to prove

2079
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:43,760
the uh to provide us with a

2080
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,520
comprehensive view of the national

2081
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,800
cyberspace

2082
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,199
threat level and alert them if any

2083
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:53,759
serious attack is detected

2084
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:55,840
here you can find an example of a

2085
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,480
deployed node is the security onion

2086
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,719
machine contributed to sniff the edge

2087
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:04,080
inbound and outbound traffic you can see

2088
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,040
here

2089
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:08,320
the suricata the recent surricata alerts

2090
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,719
with their corresponding severity

2091
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:12,320
level here

2092
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,639
this dashboard is very useful for both

2093
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:17,280
us and our partners who can access the

2094
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:20,159
same data

2095
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:24,880
another aspect of what we do within the

2096
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,480
server service is the continuous

2097
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:29,440
supervision of the national cyberspace

2098
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,280
within the team we're always on the

2099
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:34,080
lookout for uh severe tube

2100
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:37,360
security buttons or new uh

2101
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,800
published cv

2102
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,960
we analyze we take the vulnerabilities

2103
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:44,560
in order to identify the potential

2104
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:45,840
that potentially affects the

2105
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,000
organization that we notified through

2106
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,400
vulnerability and notices finally we

2107
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:51,840
remain at the

2108
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,400
disposal of this organization for any

2109
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,600
assistance

2110
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,840
in order to reject the risk as much as

2111
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,719
possible the last phase is to check

2112
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:03,520
whether the recommendation

2113
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,840
whether the affected organizations

2114
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:10,080
have applied the given recommendation

2115
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,760
in the rest of the presentation we will

2116
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,920
give you an example of how we dealt with

2117
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:17,120
proxy logon cv

2118
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,840
a scanf national cyberspace allowed us

2119
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:24,800
to discover nearly 200 exchange servers

2120
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,360
many of which are vulnerable and others

2121
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,280
are compromised with the webshell the

2122
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,440
twinset published an alert button

2123
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,159
through the website

2124
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:36,560
after this defusion a task force was

2125
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,840
created and the rules were

2126
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:42,159
dispatched between the team members

2127
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:43,120
all

2128
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:48,159
our sensors were was updated was updated

2129
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:49,199
by new

2130
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:51,199
new rules

2131
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:53,040
and the continuous research for new

2132
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,440
affected ip was performed through our

2133
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,600
safer feeds

2134
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,080
an action plan was made we alerted the

2135
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,320
concerned organism and an intervention

2136
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,480
and intervention was planned to

2137
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:07,840
remediate to the problem

2138
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:10,320
this operation we treated approximately

2139
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:13,040
uh 200 exchange servers we passed nearly

2140
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:17,679
131 and it lost about 26.

2141
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:20,080
uh here a graph showing us a decrease in

2142
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,639
the number of vulnerable um

2143
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:25,440
of the net of vulnerable servers here in

2144
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:26,880
red

2145
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,840
against the increase of the number of uh

2146
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,639
patched servers mansion i mentioned in

2147
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:34,000
light blue

2148
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,719
thank you for your attention

2149
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:40,239
i will speed i i think

2150
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,520
thank you

2151
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,520
thank you yeah speed but it's okay

2152
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,600
respected you're there with time that's

2153
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,280
good okay

2154
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,199
i haven't talked about correlation of

2155
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:51,840
events anyway

2156
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:54,400
so this is proof a little bit

2157
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,560
what you can do if you master open

2158
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,560
source tools you can integrate them you

2159
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,760
can customize them and you can

2160
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:04,239
build a very interesting systems for

2161
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:07,120
securing cyberspace are also internal

2162
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,520
information system and this is one of

2163
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,120
the case when

2164
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,440
that is the research development which

2165
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,840
was permitted first by mastering a

2166
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:18,400
little bit open source

2167
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,800
so i think we are running a little bit

2168
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:26,280
of time as tracy said if there is
