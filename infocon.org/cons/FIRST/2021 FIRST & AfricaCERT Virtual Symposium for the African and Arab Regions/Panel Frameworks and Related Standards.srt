i'd like to add my warm welcome to to

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,960
all the people who've returned i was a

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,559
really interesting session

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,320
um great to see how much the region is

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,599
doing and how the people you know all

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,960
these countries and regions are working

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,480
with organizations to really improve

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,920
this

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,920
first uh just a very quick digression

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,840
first has a vision that vision is you

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,279
know teams around the world in every

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,439
country working together to do good

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,800
stuff and make the internet a better and

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,160
safer place

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,760
and i thought this morning demonstrated

17
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,119
the the first one of our sort of

18
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,440
missions in that the global capacity

19
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,719
coordination knowing that there's

20
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,559
someone else around the world you can

21
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,000
talk to in every country and that's

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,680
really important to us so that was

23
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,440
really really exciting

24
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,280
the first of these uh sessions this

25
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,800
afternoon very much focuses on the

26
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,039
second mission that first has which is

27
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,520
all about common language we talk about

28
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,280
that as a common taxonomy and about a

29
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,199
common understanding of what things mean

30
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,879
but it also means standards it means

31
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,239
standards where systems can talk to

32
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,239
systems where things can understand each

33
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,160
other and we can do things much quicker

34
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,760
much faster and much more efficiently so

35
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,000
standards are very important at first we

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,438
spend a lot of time with working on a

37
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,880
couple and we're very interested in

38
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,720
pursuing these so i'm really interested

39
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,159

[Music]

51
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,119
chris just highlights the need for

52
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,079
common

53
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,680
language

54
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,159
we heard about capacity building

55
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,479
incident response capacity

56
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,119
national and sectoral teams

57
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,759

point of contact cyber exercise a lot of

61
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,920
jargon for building and maturing

62
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,240
maturing organizational arrangement

63
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,200
capabilities and service portfolio

64
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,680
the purpose of this panel is to discuss

65
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,318
emerging framework standard and model

66
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,598
applicable

67
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,319
to accident response and security teams

68
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,400
operation

69
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,959
first has developed the t-shirt and the

70
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,959
search service framework

71
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,040
sci has released the sectors search

72
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,879
research framework

73
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,680
and we have heard about the maturity

74
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,239
assessment model symmetry

75
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,040
igo has recently released xt 1060.

76
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,680
so what are this framework

77
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,760
we are fortunate to have chairs and

78
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
speakers that have led the development

79
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,680
of this framework

80
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,920
and they have accepted to share with us

81
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,120
their work

82
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,160

and professor

93
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,599
kozakowski has helped considerably to

94
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,640
raise the awareness of third

95
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,040
concentrating on international issue

96
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,800

[Music]

105
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,920
i hope this works and

106
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,680
you can see my

107
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,879
screen

108
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,480
i would like to share some thoughts

109
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,200
about the c search services framework

110
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,599
development which we do within a special

111
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,560
interest group within first since

112
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,480
probably four years

113
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,080
and

114
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,120
we are actually after having published

115
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,599
the most recent version of version 2.1

116
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,560
of the framework moved on in defining

117
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,760
the roles

118
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,000
that you need inside your c certs to

119
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,439
handle these services

120
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,560
um

121
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,959
so actually we got quite well support of

122
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,199
the community but also from the itu to

123
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,519
name one specific organization that

124
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,000
helped us also to translate

125
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,479
the common language we are trying to

126
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,639
achieve into the

127
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,280
natural languages we all use in our

128
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,680
specific

129
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,199
communities

130
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,680
and to make it better approachable and i

131
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,440
think this is the key and this is also

132
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,120
why i'm like to to

133
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,040
walk you through and welcome the chance

134
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,840
to

135
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,040
tell you what what we are trying to do

136
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,280
so after some some work we finally in

137
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,400
november 2 2019 we uh

138
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,840
uh offered the

139
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,280
um latest version

140
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,400
and

141
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,240
the basic idea

142
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,400
goes back actually to work i did with

143
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,199
the sei in 2003 where we tried to come

144
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:05,919
up

145
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,199
with a common set of services describing

146
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,000
by name and referencing

147
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,560
by by functions the tasks that are

148
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,120
typical for a c cert

149
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,320
and

150
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,280
only

151
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,400
more recently in the middle of

152
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,240
2000

153
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,960
2011

154
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,639
the seaside community started to think

155
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,560
about maturity

156
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,800
and we will hear later from a very good

157
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,919
friend on stickfort later on what we do

158
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,520
in regard to maturity but it's important

159
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,600
to realize that

160
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
at the beginning we don't have a

161
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,120
majority

162
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,400
we are trying to do our job

163
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,800
and to do our job we need the

164
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,520
capabilities the

165
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,639
means and the tools and the knowledge

166
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,280
first and then we are gaining more and

167
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,120
more maturity

168
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,039
and over time we will develop

169
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,080
documentation and standard procedures

170
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,880
and ways of training new team members

171
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,639
but actually

172
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,960
when when i started my first t-shirt in

173
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,960
93

174
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,360
i wasn't really concerned about maturity

175
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,960
because i was concerned about getting

176
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,280
the job done and understanding what my

177
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,479
job is

178
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,039
and you need the capabilities for the

179
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,800
jobs you need to do

180
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,400
in your specific country in your

181
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,600
specific constituency but also you need

182
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,919
the capacity and that's why it's so

183
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,759
important to start with capacity and

184
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,360
capability

185
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,160
building but don't forget about maturity

186
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,800
so we didn't try to come up with

187
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,759
packages of services that describe a

188
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,400
specific type of series and we all know

189
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,120
that the national sea cert is certainly

190
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,400
different

191
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,039
of an internal organization

192
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,840
focused seaside in any bigger

193
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,160
company and we have coordinating c certs

194
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,880
that overseeing other security teams and

195
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,199
entities inside your organization

196
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,599
made government or made

197
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,479
on the commercial side but you need to

198
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,199
coordinate these actions but necessarily

199
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,919
you will not be available on site where

200
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,000
the actual incident takes

201
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,319
off and where you need some malware

202
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,160
analyst for example

203
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,560
and people addressing the technical

204
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,319
issues you're focusing more on the

205
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,639
management of the internet

206
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,960
and certainly we realize that this is in

207
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,120
the future where we will need to come up

208
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,759
with some

209
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,319
blueprints for typical

210
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,440
team types but this is something we have

211
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,039
not on the agenda right now we are

212
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,520
focusing more on what can be done what

213
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,599
should be done by a c set and describing

214
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,280
it by proper name

215
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,400
and now

216
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,759
as i

217
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,360
said in the beginning we're focusing on

218
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,919
what kind of roles we need and the human

219
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,960
part to get the job done

220
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,560
so the seaside services are divided in

221
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,520
four

222
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,919
sorry five different areas which you

223
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,440
recognize by name certainly

224
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,360
vulnerability management which includes

225
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,599
advisory

226
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,960
and

227
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,199
event management which is also typical

228
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,319
for sock but may be done by a seaside in

229
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,759
combination

230
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,680
and the typical at the core and that's

231
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,639
why it's on the top the security

232
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,199
incident management which is

233
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,159
uh

234
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,599
in the name of a seaside already

235
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,159
the service areas are then divided in

236
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,599
specific services which we can identify

237
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,519
and separate clearly

238
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,320
and then for the services

239
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,200
to function we need the functions

240
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,800
that are

241
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,760
supported by tools

242
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,839
documented by standard operating

243
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,360
procedures

244
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,000
and maybe subdivided into other sub

245
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,160
functions and you can find all that in

246
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,920
the framework

247
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,000
laying out the different services like

248
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
we have in the vulnerability management

249
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,080
section for example

250
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,200
all activities coming from the discovery

251
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,480
research

252
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,440
over the intake of reports from other

253
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,680
security researchers or other fellow c

254
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,640
certs

255
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,880
to the analysis the coordination with

256
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,800
the vendors and the

257
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,519
development of remedies and patches and

258
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,160
waiting for them to finally be able to

259
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,920
release the information to our

260
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,480
constituents and the general public to

261
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,399
warn them about

262
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,560
what new vulnerability there might be

263
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,640
and alert them to the fact that they now

264
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,320
need to apply

265
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,040
those patches

266
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
and going from there

267
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,320
we

268
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,760
are now in this step preparing the final

269
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,000
draft for review within the first

270
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,760
community and

271
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,200
by the public

272
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,680
about roles which we

273
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,839
attribute to each specific function

274
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,360
and we

275
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,760
describe not only which roles are

276
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,079
typically

277
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,120
needed but also how these roles should

278
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,079
be defined in terms of skill set

279
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,680
competencies

280
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,160
and you see this is

281
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,279
interesting because i just took the four

282
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,040
typical roads

283
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,079
from the incident

284
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,959
security incident management area that

285
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,360
you have an incident analyst an instant

286
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
responder and the

287
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,360
incident coordinator which we

288
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,240
actually also call triage coordinator

289
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,279
because triage is the most critical

290
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,440
skill a coordinator

291
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,040
need to have

292
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,480
but if we look

293
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,519
with a closely related service area like

294
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,079
the event management we clearly see

295
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,880
overlaps in these roles which means

296
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,240
you can take benefit of this overlap by

297
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,959
having people working also in service

298
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,120
areas of the event management and also

299
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,880
in the internet management

300
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,040
but you can also split the team if you

301
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,880
have the workforce allowed

302
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,000
and

303
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,160
having the same skill set the same

304
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,839
competencies

305
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,120
but

306
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,160
using them in different contexts one

307
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,320
on the one side for the event management

308
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
and other teammates

309
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,880
for the incident management side

310
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,600
so

311
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,440
each row will be defined by a

312
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,399
description where we set a context

313
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,920
and then we certainly need to lay out

314
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,560
the general tasks which are

315
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
certainly

316
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,160
important as well

317
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,320
but we are looking also for the

318
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,040
specifics the search specific functions

319
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,440
and tasks and that's why we go back to

320
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,240
our c search services framework we

321
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,120
reference the functions

322
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,480
the role would contribute to

323
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,440
always in reference to the version 2.1

324
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,760
of this research services framework and

325
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,720
then

326
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,560
list all the general

327
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,120
generic and general competencies like

328
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,000
communication or problem solving

329
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,639
which are important also if you look at

330
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,800
the skill set and what kind of

331
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,440
people you look for to staff your teams

332
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,519
but then we move into the role specific

333
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,079
competencies like threat analysis

334
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,519
which are important

335
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,839
also for the future

336
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,360
training and

337
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,600
experience of the team

338
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,800
mates that you would like to

339
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,360
have in your team and the people you're

340
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,079
actually looking for in your team so you

341
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,839
think this pretty much summarizes what

342
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,920
the seasons services sick is doing

343
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,000
and i wouldn't now like to hand over

344
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,120
back

345
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,040
to our kind moderator thank you

346
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,920
thank you very much uh professor

347
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,440
kozakowski for this presentation on our

348
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,839
c third service framework

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,399
how it applied to different uh type of

350
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,600
teams the role that will be tremendously

351
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,320
helpful in capacity building

352
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,120
um

353
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,959
first also

354
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,800
build the p-shirt service for more

355
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,959
um i would like to

356
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,720
introduce

357
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,639
pete allo from from radar to talk to us

358
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,720
about why

359
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,519
uh in addition to this season service

360
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,720
framework

361
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,680
first

362
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,240
uh believes that it is important or

363
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,600
found important to build also a special

364
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,120
service framework

365
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,639
what it is

366
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,320
and uh how we can apply it so

367
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,199
on a quick note uh peter law is a

368
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,560
director of reddit product security team

369
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,800
where he has the responsibility for the

370
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,440
portfolio of secure development

371
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,760
through incident response

372
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,320
he is currently the chair of the first

373
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,839
pcs

374
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,920
where a number of documents supporting

375
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,000
the product security incident response

376
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,920
were developed by practitioner for

377
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,199
practitioner

378
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,199
including a framework of service

379
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,480
maturity

380
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,199
and a base incident response plan

381
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,199
bit

382
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,399
how about you please

383
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,199
thank you sean river

384
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,720
hopefully it's coming across full screen

385
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,959
now

386
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,839
so um

387
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,560
the interesting way we we do things at

388
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,399
first is that we communicate and

389
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,959
exchange a lot of information

390
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,000
and early on uh as

391
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,320
the first board and the first membership

392
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,680
looked at the c search services

393
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,000
framework and we made a lot of progress

394
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,279
there

395
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,560
and uh doctor

396
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,040
peter claus peter is moving that forward

397
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,760
to even farther refine that

398
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,920
uh we had a branch off a fork if you

399
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,880
will

400
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,320
about what do we do with peace hurts you

401
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,160
know is it the same

402
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,639
so we took the framework that uh the c

403
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,000
search services

404
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,760
sig had worked on

405
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,399
and we started to evaluate that for

406
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,120
how does it work for products

407
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,399
and if you look at your secure

408
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,000
development life cycle

409
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,279
you can look at a lot of different

410
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,199
versions you'll see that product instant

411
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,480
response is the last stage of an sdlc

412
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,079
and yet many of us

413
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,320
had tenants of that but we weren't doing

414
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,120
that exactly we were the final stage of

415
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,920
that

416
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,920
as we looked at the c-search services

417
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,040
framework we started to come to

418
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,639
realization that

419
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,920
well it didn't fit what we were doing

420
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,120
so the question was what are we doing

421
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,399
so that started the p-search services uh

422
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,000
started actually the piece or special

423
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,279
interest group

424
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,519
uh because it was one of these

425
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,040
this hasn't been described before

426
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,720
there's a couple books written about it

427
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,839
but they are mostly written from an

428
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,759
individual how do i do a particular role

429
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,800
within

430
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,600
a

431
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,880
piece

432
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,360
as opposed to what i do as the

433
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,519
organization for

434
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,040
the vendor

435
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,199
and if you look at it we describe vendor

436
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,040
quite a bit differently than many of you

437
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,079
may

438
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,320
if you're producing code

439
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,440
you are

440
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,199
a vendor

441
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,600
you may not commercially sell it

442
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,199
but the fact that you develop it

443
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,440
requires you to have a process to build

444
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,880
it and secure it

445
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,800
and part of that process includes the

446
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,199
need to respond because someone will

447
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,440
find something somewhere because like

448
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,199
all of humankind

449
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,720
mistakes are made

450
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,399
people copy things

451
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,880
and they use something from upstream

452
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,800
from an open source repository or even

453
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,480
from a closed source

454
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,320
so what we did is we started this entire

455
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,959
journey we have participating

456
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,639
depend upon our event up to 100

457
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,720
individuals a little bit over 44

458
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,880
companies like our last tc we've held

459
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,880
six of them now the fact that we have

460
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,680
this growing kind of colloquial like

461
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,279
what you are doing

462
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,360
really shows the interest that the

463
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,279
community has around serving its uh

464
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,679
ability to describe what we do and make

465
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,919
sure others understand what that is and

466
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,599
quite frankly make it easier for others

467
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,160
to enter lower the bar

468
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,000
so as we looked at the p search services

469
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,079
framework and we looked at the c search

470
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,679
services framework we start to see

471
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,439
similarities

472
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,039
we try to do the same thing about

473
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,760
service areas services functions and sub

474
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,439
functions so there's a similarity in our

475
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,559
approach

476
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,240
and we think that we need to have that

477
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,840
scenario between the two special

478
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,919
interest groups because it helps set a

479
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,400
foundation of the approach

480
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,000
but once we got past that we started to

481
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
go wait a minute other than the fact

482
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,640
that we both use instant response and

483
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,559
we're instant response teams

484
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,000
we're doing some different things i'll

485
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,600
cover that in a minute

486
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,760
our pcr services framework uh first was

487
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,520
in 2017.

488
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,160
we did an upgrade in 2019 we're in the

489
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,400
process of looking at doing another

490
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,960
version upgrade 1.2 and become more

491
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,160
iterative

492
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,120
like the rest uh the covid pandemic has

493
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,760
really put a crimp in our meeting styles

494
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,360
and how we do that

495
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,799
but we have produced some training

496
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,280
videos and a maturity guide and we look

497
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,360
to further refine those

498
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,160
and then uh we are looking at other best

499
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,600
practices and body of knowledge for

500
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
everyone to gain from so that's our

501
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,840
history what do we do

502
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,760
the key part is we're looking for active

503
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,600
industry participants

504
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,120
and from our sig

505
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,280
you do not need to be

506
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,880
a first member

507
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,760
you need to be a piece hurt

508
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,960
now we do talk to some of the

509
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,480
coordination centers

510
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,320
but they have to really define

511
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,400
themselves as a coordination center

512
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,000
and they are included in some of our

513
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
events but not necessarily a core member

514
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,240
of what we do

515
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,400
but our idea is

516
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,240
let's help everyone understand what a

517
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,240
piecer does from a services framework

518
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,559
down through the supporting

519
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,840
processes

520
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,799
best practice and other

521
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,880
informational materials so they can

522
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,160
continue or grow in their practice

523
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,600
now i have to say

524
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,880
one of the things i learned in this

525
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
entire journey is even though i wrote

526
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,440
the p search services framework as a

527
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,760
major contributor and guidance of the

528
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,559
group

529
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,280
i changed jobs i went over to another

530
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,080
organization and i found that well i

531
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,760
need to use the services framework and i

532
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,919
had to go back and re-read what i wrote

533
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,000
and i can tell you there's a difference

534
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,080
between what you wrote

535
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,280
and what you read trying to employ it

536
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,919
so i encourage anyone who's doing this

537
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,679
type of work to

538
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,120
go try it

539
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,720
see what you wrote and see if it really

540
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,120
works because what we did learn is that

541
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,440
we needed additional documentation and

542
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,480
that began into delivering on our

543
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,720
maturity assessment so you can see what

544
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,880
we've done is we've moved through these

545
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,039
goals and we start producing maturity

546
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,919
assessments and jean-robert will tell

547
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,200
you he helped

548
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,160
develop

549
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,360
a rather robust way of doing it whereas

550
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,000
we have also a simple way of doing it

551
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,440
but i also encourage you to look at some

552
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,559
other things like a bsim which shows how

553
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,480
a secure development works because if

554
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,679
you don't have the secure development

555
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,600
part of you in your organization

556
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,280
you're over here

557
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,120
catching whatever happens

558
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,000
and you never seem to move ahead

559
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,840
so we would ask that you would consider

560
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,720
doing that as well but the key for a

561
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,360
piece services framework is it's a

562
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,760
baseline if you will of a la carte

563
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,200
services

564
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,880
we tried to list all the services that

565
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,960
you could potentially look at

566
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,679
for peace and operations

567
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,200
as part of your functions as part of

568
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,840
your mission it doesn't mean that you do

569
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,840
all those functions

570
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,039
because as uh cause peter point out

571
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,960
there's a capability

572
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,320
and there's a maturity and he talked

573
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,840
about a capacity

574
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,320
and we likewise use those same terms the

575
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
capabilities can you in fact do

576
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,480
something

577
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,799
when you look at it maturity is really

578
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,200
how well can you do it

579
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,600
and capacity is how many simultaneous

580
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,919
operations can you do

581
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,760
now we differ a little bit on that part

582
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,360
of the definition but i don't think it's

583
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,919
a major difference it's how we view the

584
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,919
problem step and how we're trying to

585
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,080
approach it and put it together and too

586
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,840
often many people say you have to have a

587
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,520
full capacity with high maturity and

588
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,960
worry about capability later and it's

589
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,039
like no you have to understand from a

590
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,120
capability perspective

591
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,120
so when we look at that

592
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,200
we start to break down how do we take

593
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,720
our work because for many years we

594
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,120
operate as one great big group and it

595
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,880
worked fine for us

596
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,720
but as we matured

597
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,200
as a sig we started to realize we had

598
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,440
additional needs and we couldn't do it

599
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,360
from one centralized group so we started

600
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,559
breaking down

601
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:45,520
into

602
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,799
working groups

603
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,559
because of the pandemic we've we've

604
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,000
shortened it down to three working

605
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,919
groups but basically we continue to work

606
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,360
on our framework towards our 2.0 release

607
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,520
we're also doing maturity and supporting

608
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,799
documents i'll talk about those because

609
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,000
we talk about those in layers in a

610
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,280
minute

611
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,880
we're looking at tooling because most of

612
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,880
the time the tooling that is out there

613
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,799
does not meet the need

614
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,919
in other words it wasn't built to

615
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,600
purpose

616
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,960
and as we look through all these

617
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,280
different challenges of purpose we're

618
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,280
finding that we've all amended something

619
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,880
so now we're looking at how do we build

620
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,360
something for a purpose that fits a

621
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,280
vulnerability problem set

622
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,960
notice the issue here is

623
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,720
the incident is the vulnerability

624
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,880
not the vulnerability is an incident

625
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,960
and it's a small turn but it has to do

626
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,200
with where your focus is at

627
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,919
so we're taking uh that tooling and the

628
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,440
third-party components and we're putting

629
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,600
those together because they have a

630
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,919
commonality of what we need to produce

631
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,679
because the marketplace is both

632
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,799
demanding

633
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,400
and quite honestly without knowing

634
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,000
third-party components in our own

635
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,400
instant response process tooling they

636
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
have to work together because that is

637
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,480
what we need to search vulnerabilities

638
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,200
against especially when you have things

639
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,559
from elsewhere that you've incorporated

640
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,159
the incident coordination work group is

641
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,679
an interesting work group in the fact

642
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,000
that first took on the industry

643
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,679
consortium for advancement security

644
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,600
internet or kazi

645
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,280
and that folded into

646
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,120
the pc

647
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
and so we have this group

648
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,880
of vendors

649
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,520
who have an nda and they have a process

650
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,120
that they've taken on top of their

651
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,280
piecer process to work together

652
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
we look at that as a model for other

653
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,200
groups of emily in fact we're talking to

654
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,440
a group about how they can join us and

655
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,679
they are a reasonably focused european

656
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,840
concern that deal with certain

657
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,679
technologies operations technology

658
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:38,960
specifically

659
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,760
we

660
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,960
are

661
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,880
encouraging groups like that to form and

662
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,960
have a great trust and the question is

663
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,039
how do we help them operate

664
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:47,919
so

665
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,320
there's a slight flavor change there

666
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,919
we're not running our piece or education

667
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,600
as a separate group but we still have a

668
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,320
lot of educational responsibilities

669
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,000
so we're taking that within our working

670
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,480
groups to help develop that and put that

671
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,320
forward

672
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,840
so when i talk about the piece or

673
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,400
documents i said there's three layers

674
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,720
and our first layer is really

675
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,640
what is the framework it is the bones

676
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,720
upon which we hang all of our

677
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,840
our

678
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,080
functions and our services on

679
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,120
and

680
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,200
as we've gone through we for instance we

681
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,799
noted that as we bring in like the

682
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,559
economy type groups

683
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,159
we don't have a function that adequately

684
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,400
covers that so we have tagged that as a

685
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,799
gap and now we're writing to it so

686
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,559
you'll see that in in the future

687
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,600
versions coming out in 2022

688
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,080
layer two is a supporting layer

689
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,080
that's maturity in other words how do

690
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,720
you do a simple or complex assessment of

691
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,080
where you are

692
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,080
vis-a-vis what you think you need to be

693
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,559
from your framework

694
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,640
when i moved over here to red hat the

695
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,080
first thing i did is i looked at it and

696
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,559
i said let's write our version for red

697
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,000
hat of the peace of services framework

698
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,159
and we discovered a whole lot of gaps

699
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,600
things that we thought we were covering

700
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,919
well other areas we were covering

701
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,480
a plenty and it helped us form how do we

702
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,279
move to an instant response plan and the

703
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,880
interesting part is i got

704
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,200
i changed jobs again came to red hat and

705
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,720
i found out hey there's supporting

706
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,279
documentation we're missing like

707
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,480
how do you write an instant response

708
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,760
plan

709
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,679
from a piece or perspective

710
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,960
so

711
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,039
uh over a year i had to learn how to

712
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,600
write that and uh now we're turning that

713
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,720
back to

714
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,600
the hc for incorporation for others to

715
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,480
use

716
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,360
in all these they are examples so we're

717
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,559
trying to tell

718
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,159
those who are more regulatory inclined

719
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,159
don't use these as a checklist

720
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,400
this is really how do you go to the

721
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
market and find what you need for your

722
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,840
particular meal coming up

723
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,159
so we started in 2015 looking at the

724
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,080
what the seesaw services did we started

725
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,159
in real work in 2016

726
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,559
and that really turned on to we need to

727
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,200
have a pcrtc and then we realized this

728
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
is where we need to do our work

729
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,960
and we start with about 40 people the

730
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,840
first tc and now we're just over 100 in

731
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,559
person we went to a hybrid event

732
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,159
last year where the last event seemed

733
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,960
like for the year for almost all of us

734
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,919
and

735
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,760
we found that the hybrid event worked

736
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,640
very well and we've continues hybrid now

737
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,080
as we meet

738
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,520
so

739
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,200
the fact that we can get more and more

740
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,880
organizations joining we still have

741
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,720
people joining us it's not unusual like

742
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,080
for instance we had two different

743
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,120
organizations joining the peacert effort

744
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,440
and it's it's not often you get two but

745
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,760
you know what i'm trying to point to is

746
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,000
we still are getting a good degree of

747
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,520
people joining and want to contribute

748
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,320
the peace our services framework

749
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,640
uh one of the things is we're while we

750
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,559
use the same terms we're organized

751
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,320
slightly different we actually looked at

752
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,480
the at the c-search services framework

753
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,840
we looked in this cybersecurity

754
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,080
framework we looked at the uk cyber

755
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,440
essentials and a few other things and

756
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,000
said wait a minute how does this work

757
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,919
and then we looked at sdlc and said well

758
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,080
no we're not the sdlc i mean we

759
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,600
acknowledge that we're connected but

760
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,039
we're not part of it

761
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,880
so we had to go through and rework it

762
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,960
and we actually redesigned ourselves

763
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,799
like the c-search services

764
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,440
sig did several times to find what

765
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,760
actually was most appropriate

766
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,600
so we broke down our service areas in

767
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,720
the six

768
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,080
i'm not going to go through all of them

769
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,440
but i do encourage you to go to the

770
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,600
first website and look at them

771
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,000
and you can see the biggest thing in in

772
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,919
in our opera organization foundation is

773
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,279
you have to figure out how you want to

774
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,360
operate what you want to be and you have

775
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,799
all the normal things you have as a

776
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,080
business

777
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,480
but the stakeholder ecosystem really

778
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,799
became the key area because you have to

779
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,720
know who you're serving

780
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,399
we're a service organization we serve

781
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,000
others

782
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,679
we help coordinate we help move things

783
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,399
through we help people stay accountable

784
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,760
we help hold

785
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,240
to coordination but that's the biggest

786
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,159
area and then you look the ones in the

787
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,320
center it's really about what do we do

788
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,799
it's about discovery it's about triage

789
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,240
it's about remediation it's about

790
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,440
disclosure

791
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,120
and discovery usually is coordination

792
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,880
with someone

793
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,039
triage is how do you look at and assess

794
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,320
it

795
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,600
know who it affects within your

796
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,760
organization who you need to coordinate

797
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,440
within without

798
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,480
and here's your initial

799
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,080
i think this is the problem that we have

800
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,840
to do

801
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,360
the vulnerability

802
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,000
remediation is actually a continuation

803
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,080
within engineering

804
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,679
because here you have to work with both

805
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,440
product managers and engineering

806
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,159
managers and qe managers to go through

807
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,720
and fix the problem and anything that's

808
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,919
associated

809
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,360
and then you have to make sure that it

810
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,440
works properly within the product or

811
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,880
application that uh it's within and then

812
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,799
you have to look at dependencies

813
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,559
and the dependencies are a huge part

814
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,480
because many of us have dependencies

815
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,399
from one product to another product to a

816
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,399
third product it's not unusual to see

817
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,360
that in many larger vendors

818
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,960
and then disclosure

819
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,520
disclosure is a morphing subject to us

820
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,320
but

821
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,840
you know the question is how do you

822
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,960
release

823
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,120
as opposed to disclose

824
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,480
and so that's a concept that we're

825
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,720
evaluating and then of course training

826
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,360
education all about what do you need to

827
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,600
do and start somebody here and what do

828
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,159
you need to do as you learn what you

829
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,440
didn't do well

830
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,760
retrospectives are very big for us

831
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,520
because you usually look for a root

832
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,600
cause analysis in both the code

833
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,000
and your process and then what do you do

834
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,360
for your instant response so there's

835
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,399
usually three levels to that

836
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,399
maturity i think i've covered enough but

837
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,799
the key is that if you can't look at

838
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,039
yourself from a maturity perspective

839
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,960
and put a mark on a wall what you want

840
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,559
to measure yourself against or what you

841
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,200
want to become you can't get there and

842
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,799
so maturity is our measure of ourselves

843
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,640
it's a self-assessment

844
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,399
and how do we do that in a consistent

845
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,480
way that actually brings

846
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,200
us

847
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,320
to

848
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,559
accomplishing the tasks handed to us

849
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,480
remember we don't write our own mission

850
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,480
our mission comes from our stakeholders

851
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,679
so we have to be able to tell them how

852
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,120
well we're doing against that mission

853
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,240
statement

854
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,559
we point this out for doc for

855
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,240
organizations who are

856
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,480
um learning about this so they don't

857
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,600
have to learn

858
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,120
all the things we learned the hard way

859
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,679
over the past 20 years

860
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:18,640
okay

861
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,480
so the big thing i'll ask you is if

862
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,320
you're writing something if you're

863
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,919
distributing something if you're

864
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,600
producing code

865
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,440
you've crossed into the land of neenah

866
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,279
piecer you have to have instant response

867
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,960
almost every government

868
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,120
uh regional concern like anissa will

869
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,279
tell you hey you should be doing instant

870
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,360
response for your products

871
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,279
so have something designated for that

872
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,480
and if you have a large enough

873
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,559
population of products have somebody

874
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,200
that is their full-time job because they

875
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,279
they can't be swiveled off into well i'm

876
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,360
building something

877
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,120
you you have to have that separation of

878
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,200
duty you need somebody who's looking out

879
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,720
for your organization to make sure that

880
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,240
you're doing it right

881
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,000
if you have any questions you have

882
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,679

883

888
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,120
listen to how you put the t-shirt work

889
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,679
into perspective

890
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:20,480

accident response

897
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,799
but they also mentioned about maturity

898
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,519
and the ability to measure oneself

899
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,399
against in the consistent manner

900
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,519
i would like to introduce uh don stigwat

internet in europe

903
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,640
uh he recognized security as a concern

904
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,720
early around the 91 chair

905

he became a first member in ne2

909

uh he is a co-chair of the traffic light

910
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,120
protocol working group

911
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,960
another

912
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,480
common language that first is developing

913
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,039
they met participating in the metric and

914
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,440
a teach working group

915
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,320
uh he wrote the handbook for computer

916
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,559
security assistant response team

917
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,880

security community

919
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,640
through sqs sql the company he founded

920
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,080
and uh

921
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,360
very important for the topic don't

922
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,440
create that symmetry maturity model

923
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,120
first

924
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,559

927
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,519
been around for quite a long time which

928
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,440
is probably true and by the way the

929
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,840
handbook uh for seashells was written

930
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,360
together with more i was brown and klaus

931
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,679
peter kozakowski

932
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:10,720
so

933
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,559
first africa sir thank you very much for

934
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,840
the invite wonderful to be here

935
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,279
wonderful to see

936
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,679
over 90 participants and of course there

937
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,840
are some people who i know for decades

938
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,039
like the two peters and chris and sergey

939
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,279
but also a lot of

940
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,519
people who i may not have met yet and i

941
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,360
hope to meet and it shows me that

942
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,720
there's a lot of interest in the

943
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,159
frameworks that we are talking about

944
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,679
here and i think that that is a very

945
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,240
good thing because it's important okay

946
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,600
without

947
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,559
more text let me see if my

948
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,840
slides want to share

949
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,000
i think they do

950
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,799
so this is what i'm going to talk about

951
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,519
here with thanks to not only first and

952
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,840
africa cert but also the open season

953
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,600
foundation

954
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,679
in which i am active and cyber for death

955
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,360
who is allowing me to talk here

956
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,679
very short some some some intros what

957
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,359
actually led to the thinking about c

958
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,280
cert uh maturity

959
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,960
first of all and you can read the slide

960
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,320
for for yourself it's a little bit of

961
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,440
history

962
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,119
of the um

963
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,320
the c-cert

964
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,440
community

965
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,440
which started around 1988 1989

966
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,480
it is basically a structured mesh

967
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,679
so we have

968
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,520
many types of teams and if you look more

969
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,679
towards the bottom of the slides you see

970
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,079
the name cert there of course which is

971
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,280
the original

972
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,918
search cc which is the one who gave the

973
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,520
name to that and then c cert ncc cdc

974
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,239
but we also have teams and and uh pete

975
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,760
peter has been talking about this just

976
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,159
now which we generally refer to as

977
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,320
p-search product security teams we have

978
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,119
isacs we have socks

979
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,719
and we have those all over the world and

980
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,560
we have them on all sorts of levels we

981
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,160
have more national levels we have them

982
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,680
on corporate levels

983
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,920
um it's it's a complicated setup there

984
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,079
is of course some form of hierarchy but

985
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,760
it's not a very strict or formal

986
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,280
hierarchy that's not the way the

987
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,119
internet works and that's not the way

988
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,119
the this community works so on the right

989
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,119
hand side you see sort of a picture

990
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,480
which indicates that if you have a lot

991
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,480
of teams you have even more if you have

992
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,160
actually n teams you could end up with

993
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,400
more with around n square

994
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,560
connections

995
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,160
um

996
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,920
that's a lot and that's what i refer to

997
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,440
as a structured mesh and how are you

998
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,680
actually going to make this work

999
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,800
well we do

1000
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,359
but next one trust

1001
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,680
very simple uh picture

1002
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,920
well yes i'm a mountaineer and if you do

1003
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,359
mountaineering somebody has their

1004
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,040
microphone open could you please turn it

1005
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,560
off

1006
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,040
uh thank you

1007
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,640
in mountaineering trust is essential if

1008
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,400
you rope up with someone you need to

1009
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,599
trust them

1010
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,920
um trust is equally important in our

1011
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,119
community

1012
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,200
well most of you know that but those

1013
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,040
among our participants who are maybe new

1014
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,839
to this this season world

1015
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,160
please listen because trust is the one

1016
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,320
most important

1017
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,400
quality that is needed to make this

1018
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,760
system work we also found in the in the

1019
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,040
during the

1020
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,560
corona crisis

1021
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,520
that

1022
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,359
it's actually pretty hard to build trust

1023
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,520
with online meetings

1024
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,960
if you know people already it's fine if

1025
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,320
you don't know people how are you going

1026
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,240
to build these trust relationships and

1027
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,480
without trust relationships this system

1028
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,079
this structured mesh that i was talking

1029
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,040
about

1030
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,720
doesn't really work so okay we have we

1031
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,560
have this complicated system which has

1032
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,520
the world work worldwide

1033
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,400
and

1034
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,119
and trust is a is a basic factor in that

1035
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,079
actually

1036
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,000
i put those two here because back in

1037
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,720
2007 it led me to thinking about um the

1038
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,960
fact that we that was 2007 that's a long

1039
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,960
time ago 14 years

1040
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,800
uh that we needed to introduce some kind

1041
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,960
of concept of maturity which was quite

1042
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,440
common in other areas of life or work

1043
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,119
but we didn't really talk about it back

1044
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,440
in 2007 or we just started talking about

1045
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
it of course i discussed it with friends

1046
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,560
like class peter kosikovsky um i i

1047
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,240
remember some some very good talks in

1048
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,839
his in his home where we actually

1049
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,280
started to draw up some of the basic

1050
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,079
concepts concepts of what is now sims 3

1051
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,240
and i actually wrote it down in 2008 and

1052
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,119
we piloted it in in 2009 with quite a

1053
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,000
variety of teams in europe

1054
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,880
so

1055
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,640
that started to become a standard and

1056
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,560
actually uh

1057
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,560
in 2010 it was picked up by the european

1058
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,560
season community and they still use it

1059
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,119
today for certification ti certification

1060
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:29,920
there's

1061
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,560
some 30 or 40 teams that are currently

1062
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,920
certified

1063
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,200
now in 2015 as part of an uh an

1064
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,920
international conference in the hague

1065
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,160
we actually wrote down some attempt at

1066
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,920
what maturity means you can define this

1067
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,359
in many ways but what we wrote down in

1068
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,680
2015 was in the middle of the slide an

1069
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,800
indication of how well a team governs

1070
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,599
high level documents writes it down

1071
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,160
performs and measures their function all

1072
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,280
of that

1073
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,520
somehow part of part of maturity i'll

1074
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,280
come to sims 3 contents in a moment of

1075
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,400
course

1076
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,680
there was a c maturity kit written in in

1077
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,920
international context um which was based

1078
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,079
on sims 3 and then an important step and

1079
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,320
it also goes back to what uh peter

1080
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,400
kozakowski and p taylor have just been

1081
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,599
talking about

1082
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,520
is that we were developing this sims 3

1083
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,800
and there was also the development of

1084
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,200
the services framework and back in seoul

1085
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,480
and i'm pretty sure pete eller will

1086
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,160
remember we actually sat down and said

1087
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,280
okay how are we actually going to make

1088
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,280
these these two work together and we

1089
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,960
came up with this model that is in the

1090
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,480
in the slide here and that still works

1091
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,480
today where you can see sims 3 as sort

1092
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,960
of a baseline of security which is

1093
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,280
security of the organizational aspects

1094
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,760
human aspects tools and processes i'll

1095
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,000
come to that in a moment

1096
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,800
and one part of this sims 3 broad

1097
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,480
maturity is the services that a team has

1098
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,000
whether it's a c-series or a p-shirt you

1099
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,440
need services

1100
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,040
and that's where the services frameworks

1101
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,720
come in back then it was one framework

1102
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,240
right now it's the c-series first

1103
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,160
t-shirt services framework

1104
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,720
and the research services framework

1105
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,800
um but in both cases there's a very

1106
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,320
structured approach to what are you

1107
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,440
actually offering as services

1108
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,040
in the case of c-search very clearly to

1109
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,720
your constituency

1110
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,040
so you can see them as as

1111
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,480
perpendicular on each other they

1112
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,720
actually work together very well

1113
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,400
and this way of looking at it i think

1114
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,280
has served us very well since 2016 and

1115
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,200
still does

1116
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,599
okay now i'm talking about sims 3 what's

1117
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,040
actually all about

1118
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,079
so it means security incident management

1119
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,560
maturity model mmm

1120
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,240
that's m3

1121
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,480
and very important is that it is a

1122
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,320
neutral model

1123
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,480
so sims 3 doesn't really tell you how to

1124
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,960
do your work it doesn't tell you how

1125
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,720
good you should be

1126
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,359
it only gives you a number of parameters

1127
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,200
44

1128
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,200
and these parameters span four

1129
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,359
categories as you see on the slide

1130
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:54,720
organization

1131
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,760
human

1132
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,760
tools and processes

1133
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,680
it gives you these 44 parameters it

1134
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,599
gives you a measuring scale on the right

1135
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,640
hand side i'll come to that

1136
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,640
and then you can use that in any way you

1137
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,040
like you can use it for membership

1138
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,960
criteria you can use it for your own

1139
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,480
internal development you can set your

1140
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,040
own standard you can for a community you

1141
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,640
can make a standard

1142
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,960
a baseline basically but sims 3 doesn't

1143
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,400
tell you how to do that this is up to

1144
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,240
you so it's a neutral maturity model

1145
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,079
that does not prescribe that's a very

1146
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,760
important concept

1147
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,680
the measuring scale is the same for all

1148
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,839
the parameters it has five maturity

1149
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,480
levels and they go from zero to four

1150
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,040
it's basically very simple scale so if

1151
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,960
you apply it in real life there is some

1152
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,599
complexity to it but okay zero

1153
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,280
not available one

1154
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,319
it's

1155
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,000
implicit it's between your ears it's

1156
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,079
what people think and know

1157
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,760
but they haven't written it down so

1158
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,599
experts always have a lot of level one

1159
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,520
going on

1160
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,800
they know how to do it but they haven't

1161
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,240
written it down

1162
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,400
level two and three it's written down

1163
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,800
level two means it's uh more or less

1164
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,119
informally written down like wiki pages

1165
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,040
etc level three it is formalized by the

1166
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,480
the c sort of authority the head of the

1167
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,760
csr

1168
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,280
level four is the interesting one

1169
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,520
because level four goes outside the

1170
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,839
c-search boundary level four means that

1171
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,839
there is some kind of regular assessment

1172
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,240
going on by a higher governance level

1173
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,160
the whole meaning of level four is to

1174
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,480
make sure that uh communication is

1175
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,760
established between the higher

1176
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,000
governance level and the c-cert which

1177
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,520
should lead to improvement of the

1178
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,599
t-shirt and that's why level four for a

1179
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,440
number of parameters doesn't have to be

1180
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,599
all 44 for sure or not but for a number

1181
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,760
of key parameters it is really good

1182
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,240
to strive for level four so that's

1183
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,640
basically sims 3. it's very simple if

1184
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,800
you go to one of my long trainings i can

1185
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,319
talk talk to you about all the

1186
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:45,760
parameters but that takes more time than

1187
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,400
i have now

1188
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,319
you can then measure

1189
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,160
your team and there are online tools for

1190
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,000
that which every one of you can use

1191
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,560
right now and you get for all the 44

1192
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,000
parameters which you see here on the

1193
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,359
outside of this

1194
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,599
radar diagram you can you can get a

1195
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,400
measurement going from zero to four

1196
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,640
which is the concentric circles

1197
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,400
and then you get this kind of nice

1198
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,680
picture which is

1199
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,079
very nice to use in border rooms talking

1200
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,040
with your

1201
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,520
with your higher management et cetera

1202
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,760
and if you improve basically your your

1203
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,800
graph becomes wider you get a bigger

1204
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,280
surface area within the graph when your

1205
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,839
maturity grows

1206
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,240
okay what's going on right now um we

1207
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,400
have had a lot of development since 2016

1208
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,079
the open season foundation picked up

1209
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,960
sims 3 from me basically

1210
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,720
uh which gives me a really good feeling

1211
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,560
because it means that some some i also

1212
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,240
get older at some stage i can step out

1213
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,560
and sim3 is safe

1214
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,040
also trained sims 3 auditors which is a

1215
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,359
very important concept for the

1216
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,079
further development of sims 3

1217
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,079
our friends in japan use sims 3 quite

1218
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,000
extensively for maturity development

1219
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,079
purposes i saw masato terrada among the

1220
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,839
people who are listening in here he is

1221
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:01,599
actually a certified sim street auditor

1222
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,400
anissa applied it for national and

1223
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,720
sectoral teams in europe to create three

1224
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,200
maturity profiles they are called basic

1225
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,680
intermediate and advanced and basically

1226
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,079
this is a an application of sims 3 where

1227
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,240
you say okay if you're a national team

1228
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,160
you can you can grow in maturity from

1229
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,319
basic to intermediate to advanced and it

1230
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,319
gives you everything you need to know to

1231
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:23,760
do that

1232
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,400
the the gse found is such a useful idea

1233
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,480
that they actually globalized this inisa

1234
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,800
sims 3 approach in what is called the

1235
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,680
global css maturity framework or gcmf

1236
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,560
a new version of last april

1237
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,160
it's become sims 3 has become quite

1238
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,560
popular in latin america laknik oes

1239
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,400
africa africa cert of course trust

1240
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,880
broker africa

1241
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,480
and while i'm speaking also on behalf of

1242
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,480
cyber for deaf here cyber forever is a

1243
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,240
capacity cyber security capacity

1244
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,040
building project which works basically

1245
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,960
all over the world and we use sims 3

1246
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,200
there to help mostly national and

1247
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,839
sectoral teams develop their maturity

1248
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,200
first

1249
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,040
with together with ocf signed in mou and

1250
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,200
first picked up sims 3

1251
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,000
for the membership application process

1252
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
and i'll show you what that looks like

1253
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
because if you go to the tool which is

1254
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
so by the way you will get slides

1255
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,920
afterwards i will spread them

1256
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,359
you can apply the tool which is

1257
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,200
currently there the ocf 2 versus also

1258
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,760
working on their own version

1259
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,440
and on the right hand side in the radar

1260
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,480
diagram you actually see that first has

1261
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,240
taken 11 of the 44 parameters and there

1262
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,760
are some minimum

1263
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,680
values there and this is the kind of

1264
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,800
system that is currently being

1265
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,680
introduced by first to make the process

1266
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,760
of new membership application uh more

1267
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,440
structured

1268
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,280
and and that's what sims 3 is being used

1269
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,160
for now final slide

1270
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,640
we are currently working on something

1271
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,079
quite exciting

1272
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,760
um which we call sims 3v2 codename it's

1273
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,520
basically the next version of sims3 well

1274
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,119
we want to keep backwards compatibility

1275
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,119
as much as possible because so many

1276
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,359
people all over the world are using this

1277
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,720
standard

1278
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,319
but you need to understand that sims 3

1279
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,400
was basically designed for any kind of

1280
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,040
c-cert whether you call absurd or ncc or

1281
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,160
cdc

1282
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,680
and has proven to work very well for

1283
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,640
those

1284
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,200
on all continents you can use it for

1285
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,960
part of it for be searched for i6 and

1286
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,040
sock but it's not an ideal fit

1287
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,800
so what we're working on right now is

1288
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,319
actually we have already worked together

1289
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,720
with the nissan from ocf that is

1290
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,119
on an updated draft which is still

1291
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,200
focusing on c search which has basically

1292
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,280
bringing it up to date and and and doing

1293
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,119
various improvements but the more

1294
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,960
exciting work will still happen because

1295
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,880
in the course of the coming year we will

1296
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,240
actually expand sims 3 to work for

1297
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,640
pseuds i6 and socks and they are all a

1298
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,480
little different right there there are

1299
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,920
lots of similarities but they're like

1300
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,160
like pete eller argue the peace is just

1301
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,240
a little different

1302
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,839
we will continue to issue more language

1303
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,319
versions we started with that uh improve

1304
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,319
the online tool and very important

1305
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,480
anyone who wants to use the sims 3 for

1306
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,560
internal use for first use for africa

1307
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,960
search use for not-for-profit use

1308
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,240
everyone is free if you really want to

1309
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,920
make a profit on using it then i would

1310
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,599
say talk to ocf and see how you can

1311
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,880
contribute to the development

1312
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,720
and training of sims 3 audit is a key

1313
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,880
component in uh the

1314
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,720
sustainability strategy that we have for

1315
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,560
sims 3 and sims 3

1316
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,400
v2 so

1317
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,040
that was what i wanted to share with you

1318
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,200
i hope it was useful

1319
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,040
thanks for joining me in the air charlo

1320
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,160

uh thank you so much for sharing your

1324
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,160
your experience and your passion for

1325
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,560
maturity measurement with us

1326
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,599
now in the three previous

1327
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:46,640
talk

1328
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,640
we've heard

1329
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,839
about

1330
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,760
national censored sectoral situations

1331
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,720
early this year

1332
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,319
sci has released the c-3

1333
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:03,520
the sector's research framework

1334
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,359
i would like to invite justin novak to

1335
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,520
talk to us about

1336
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,800
why

1337
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,760
sci believes that

1338
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,400
having a sister service framework is

1339
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,960
relevant and what it is

1340
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,559
justin is a senior security operation

1341
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:25,200
researcher at the third division of the

1342
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,440
software engineering institute

1343
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,200
a federally founded research and

1344
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,839
development center hosted at visibilian

1345
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,200
university

1346
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,680
at third he is involved in research on

1347
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,240
the operation of c-search sector c-33

1348
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,720
and security operations centers

1349
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,960
focusing on accident response and

1350
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,520
incident management just then over to

1351
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,760

yes thank you geneva

1353

[Music]

1354
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,440
okay hopefully the slides are shine um

1355
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,960
again thank you jean-robert for the

1356
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,520
introduction and uh thank you

1357
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,240
to all the hosts and to first for

1358
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,640
organizing this event and putting

1359
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,559
together this this really outstanding

1360
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:09,599
panel

1361
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:10,640
um

1362
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,880
i don't have that many slides so i'm

1363
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,200
just gonna talk a little bit about the

1364
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,920
sector c search framework um a little

1365
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,280
bit about why we developed it um what is

1366
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,880
in it

1367
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,960
and then i just wanted to mention

1368
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,160
one or two kind of key aspects of the

1369
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,160
the sector c cert framework

1370
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,559
that we think are really important and

1371
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,800
really relevant to the discussion that

1372
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,119
we've had so far today

1373
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,480
um

1374
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,119
uh particularly with what uh some of the

1375
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,200
panelists here in this panel have talked

1376
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,680
about uh but also in the previous panel

1377
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,280
that talked about

1378
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,359
some of the cooperative type of efforts

1379
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,680
uh international and regional efforts

1380
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,280
and hopefully we'll start to see how

1381
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,960
everything kind of fits together

1382
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,000
so in any case as charmer bear said we

1383
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,480
published this sector c certs framework

1384
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,640
uh earlier this year

1385
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,640
now it's it's been something that we've

1386
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,000
been working on

1387
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,040
really for the last couple of years

1388
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,640
trying to get

1389
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,839
our our heads wrapped

1390
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,160
how is a sector seizure different than

1391
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,920
some of the other sea certs that that we

1392
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,200
see

1393
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,359
i think we talk about national sea certs

1394
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,119
a lot

1395
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:27,440
you also hear a lot of talk about

1396
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,079
sea certs in the private sector things

1397
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:31,599
like pcerts

1398
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,480
you know those types of organizations

1399
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,280
but we also know that a lot of countries

1400
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,319
and a lot of economies also deploy

1401
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,200
certs that are specific to a particular

1402
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,119
sector of the economy

1403
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,760
or what we call sector certs

1404
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,000
so we wanted to capture

1405
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,040
what makes those organizations different

1406
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,319
and what the special and unique needs of

1407
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:59,119
those organizations are

1408
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,000
and

1409
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,079
we kind of went back to

1410
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:05,119
a a really um old

1411
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,800
it's old at this point document that

1412
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,960
you've already heard mentioned once in

1413
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,319
this session um and that is the um the

1414
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,800
handbook for creating c-serves which was

1415
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,520
uh co-authored by a couple people who

1416
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,079
are on this panel i know i think don uh

1417
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,960
stick for it and cause peter were also

1418
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,040
part of that effort and then some of my

1419
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,200
colleagues here at the sei

1420
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,440
um but that document i think the most

1421
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,480
recent version was published in 2003

1422
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,559
and it's still an incredibly important

1423
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,319
resource for the community

1424
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:39,280
and an incredibly relevant document

1425
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,720
particularly for something that's almost

1426
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,040
20 years old

1427
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,000
but

1428
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,160
as we had been working over the last few

1429
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,960
years and encountering a lot of people

1430
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,400
who wanted to develop sector seasons

1431
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,680
what we realized is that

1432
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,760
not so much that that the cser's

1433
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,480
handbook was not adequate but that we

1434
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,240
needed to build on it and add to it

1435
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,520
to look at the specific um case or or

1436
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,280
the unique characteristics of a sector

1437
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,400
ceaser

1438
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,200
um so we partnered with uh some of our

1439
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,000
sponsors at the us department of state i

1440
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,640
know elizabeth fish was uh on one of the

1441
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,400
prior panels uh elizabeth and her team

1442
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,839
at the u.s department of state were

1443
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:25,680
incredibly supportive

1444
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,000
of us putting this document together

1445
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,760
so we thank them

1446
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,200
we also

1447
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,680
talked to some of our colleagues in the

1448
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,520
first community so we appreciate all

1449
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,000
those contributions

1450
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,319
and at the end what we have is a

1451
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,760
document that i think really captures

1452
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,119
all of the unique

1453
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,119
needs of that sector sector cser

1454
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,839
so let me jump into

1455
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:53,119
um

1456
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:55,599
some of the key aspects of the framework

1457
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:57,200
itself

1458
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,880
so the first thing that we

1459
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,599
wanted to understand is

1460
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,640
what exactly is a sector c cert you know

1461
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,160
what is a sector

1462
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,079
and what makes it different than other

1463
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,400
types of c-certs that you see other

1464
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,079
types of c-series that are out there

1465
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:15,839
like a p-cert like a national cesar

1466
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,200
so we started by coming up with some

1467
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,680
definitions we defined what a sector is

1468
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,720
a sector is just a particular piece of a

1469
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,800
national economy

1470
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,920
that

1471
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,200
only focuses or only includes

1472
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,319
particular

1473
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,000
operators whether they be a critical

1474
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,079
infrastructure operator or just a

1475
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,760
non-critical

1476
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,680
sector

1477
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,920
but in order to be part of that sector

1478
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,240
you have to have some stake in the

1479
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,559
success of that sector for a given

1480
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,920
economy or for a given country

1481
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,760
so once we kind of had an understanding

1482
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,280
of what we meant when we were using the

1483
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,880
word sector

1484
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,079
we set about defining a sector ceaser

1485
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:58,000
so the sector c cert what it really

1486
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,960
comes down to is the functions

1487
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,920
and

1488
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,960
i i know that may seem a little odd but

1489
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,200
we didn't define it by saying

1490
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,839
here is what we think a sector ceaser is

1491
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,240
here's a description of a sector c cert

1492
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,480
we defined it by saying these are the

1493
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,640
functions that a sector c search should

1494
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,599
do

1495
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,280
and if your c cert is doing these

1496
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,599
functions for a particular sector then

1497
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,520
you have a sector c server

1498
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,319
so

1499
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,119
it really is a similar approach to what

1500
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,280
you see for maybe the uh c search

1501
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,440
services framework or even the piecework

1502
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,520
services framework that really talk

1503
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,319
about uh services or functions

1504
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,079
we used kind of a similar approach here

1505
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,640
for the sector c search framework

1506
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,599
so

1507
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,760
what we came up with is that

1508
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,599
a sector c cert

1509
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,800
will perform vital tasks that

1510
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,079
are in service of a particular sector of

1511
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:53,920
responsibility

1512
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,359
but not for any other sectors so these

1513
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,839
services or tasks can be instant

1514
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:01,520
response

1515
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,079
communication and coordination is often

1516
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,240
one of the most common services that a

1517
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,839
sector ceaser may offer

1518
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:10,400
um

1519
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,240
hosting discussions bringing

1520
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,920
stakeholders together

1521
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,040
um particularly if you don't have a lot

1522
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,880
of history of communication or

1523
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,599
cooperation or things like that

1524
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,280
and then a really important function of

1525
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,599
a sector ceaser is building trust and

1526
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:30,079
confidentiality among members i think

1527
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:31,680
that was highlighted in the discussion

1528
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,920
about peace

1529
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,839
you know the the need for trust and

1530
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,119
things like that

1531
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,799
this is also really important in the

1532
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:41,760
sector community because oftentimes you

1533
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,079
have stakeholders who may be business

1534
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,160
competitors but they have to work

1535
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,880
together on incident response

1536
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,880
in order for everyone to be successful

1537
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,400
in order to have sort of that that

1538
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,079
shared security

1539
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,720
that you hoped that to achieve

1540
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,919
with the sector ceaser

1541
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,960
sorry um

1542
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,960
so once we had those sort of definitions

1543
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,720
laid out

1544
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,880
we we sat down and got to work on

1545
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,119
building this framework and what we

1546
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:14,079
wanted to achieve was a tool that would

1547
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,280
help

1548
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,760
build sector c certs or build capacity

1549
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,440
for sector c certs now get into that

1550
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,359
here in just another minute

1551
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,359
but before we do

1552
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:25,119
um our overarching purpose for the

1553
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,680
sector cesar framework was

1554
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,040
to help

1555
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,200
build sector c-certs but also to

1556
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,359
integrate them into what we call the

1557
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:36,319
national cyber security ecosystem

1558
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,640
i'll discuss that in great detail a

1559
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,720
little bit later because

1560
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,799
thinking about that national ecosystem

1561
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,359
is a really important part of what this

1562
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:47,280
framework does

1563
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,040
and a really important part of why we

1564
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,720
put this framework together

1565
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,079
but the national cyber security

1566
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,200
ecosystem is just a way to describe all

1567
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,480
of those stakeholders across or yeah

1568
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,359
across the country that have some

1569
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:04,640
important role to play in cyber security

1570
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,200
so this includes the sector c certs but

1571
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,480
also includes

1572
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,799
private companies law enforcement a

1573
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,720
national c-cert

1574
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,559
possibly a national cyber coordination

1575
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,799
center you can include a lot of other

1576
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,040
stakeholders

1577
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,680
and if you have a sector c cert it's

1578
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,480
great to have a functional capable team

1579
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,480
but it's even better if that functional

1580
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,799
capable team integrates with the rap the

1581
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,720
rest of that ecosystem

1582
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,240
and can really share across sectors and

1583
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,720
sort of build on any success that it has

1584
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,559
within the sector

1585
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:40,400
another thing i want to mention here at

1586
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,440
this point

1587
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,000
is that we do use in this document the

1588
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,640
term sector cser

1589
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,440
but the framework itself

1590
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,160
is developed and written in such a way

1591
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,119
that it is broadly applicable to any

1592
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,680
organization that is responsible for

1593
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,880
insulin response incident management or

1594
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,280
coordination and communication across

1595
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,040
one of those sectors

1596
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,760
so this could be something like an isac

1597
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,799
uh it could be a sock

1598
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:13,359
a sector-based cyber security center or

1599
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:15,680
coordination center

1600
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,799
so we do use the term sector c cert but

1601
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:21,280
we also use the term

1602
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,440
sector-based incident response

1603
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,400
capability um and we use that that later

1604
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,760
term

1605
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,440
just to be a little more broad and

1606
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,400
encompassing of all the different forms

1607
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,200
that

1608
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,760
sector incident response can take i

1609
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,720
again including ice axe sox all of those

1610
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,280
different organizations so we feel that

1611
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,880
this framework is applicable to all of

1612
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,720
those different organizations

1613
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,960
um so we hope if you're using a slightly

1614
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,400
different model you might still be able

1615
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,359
to use this resource

1616
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,799
okay so getting into the framework a

1617
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:55,839
little bit

1618
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,359
um

1619
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:59,359
when we were putting this together again

1620
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:02,160
we wanted this primarily to be relevant

1621
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,000
to and applicable to teams that are

1622
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,400
sitting down and thinking about how do i

1623
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,119
develop a sector ceaser or how do i

1624
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:13,119
improve the capability of a sector c

1625
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,960
server so throughout the framework

1626
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,720
throughout the document you'll see the

1627
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,480
term development team

1628
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,119
and what we mean by development team is

1629
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:25,359
just that group or organization which is

1630
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:26,960
leading the effort to develop that

1631
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,119
sector c cert or that sector incident

1632
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,440
response capability

1633
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,559
now

1634
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,400
there's could be a lot of different

1635
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,760
things

1636
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,520
oftentimes the development team is led

1637
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,440
by a national sea cert

1638
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,280
maybe it's being led by an industry

1639
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,640
organization

1640
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,520
or a small group of stakeholders within

1641
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,599
a particular sector

1642
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,200
so it could be a couple different tim

1643
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,760
things but that development team is

1644
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,000
really the audience for this document

1645
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,520
and really the purpose of the document

1646
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,480
again

1647
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,119
is to help you develop those sector c

1648
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,880
certs and improve those capabilities

1649
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,000
broadly the framework is is broken into

1650
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,720
these six steps uh there are a few other

1651
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,280
pieces in there and a lot of resources

1652
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,040
and different information that can help

1653
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,079
you

1654
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,160
in this mission in this process of

1655
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,799
developing a sector c search framework

1656
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:20,559
but the document itself is broken into

1657
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:22,000
these six steps

1658
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,799
step one is satisfying the prerequisites

1659
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,680
prerequisites are all of the questions

1660
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,119
that you really need to think about

1661
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:31,599
before you can dive into the process

1662
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,119
because if you haven't at least thought

1663
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:34,640
about these questions you're going to

1664
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,400
have trouble later on

1665
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,400
we do emphasize that you don't need to

1666
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,319
have answers

1667
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:41,920
but you need to have thought about them

1668
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,280
because you need to know where you're

1669
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,680
going to go to get the answers

1670
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,000
so prerequisites are things like

1671
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,119
think about

1672
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,799
how are you going to fund the sector

1673
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:53,599
ceaser think about where the sector cert

1674
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,760
is going to be hosted

1675
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,760
what is the definition of of the

1676
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,359
particular sector

1677
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,839
and who are all of the stakeholders

1678
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:04,240
in that sector in your country or in

1679
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,839
your economy

1680
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:07,440
these are things that that would be

1681
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,280
different or might change from country

1682
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,760
to country from economy to economy so

1683
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,200
you have to be thinking about those

1684
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,520
things and at least again know where

1685
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,359
you're going to go to get the answers

1686
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:18,799
you're looking for

1687
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,400
that leads you into step two which is

1688
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,720
gathering information here's where you

1689
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,720
actually go out and start to answer some

1690
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,280
of those questions but also start to

1691
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,280
engage with all of the stakeholders and

1692
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,119
all the community members

1693
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,520
to understand what their needs are what

1694
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,000
their expectations would be for a sector

1695
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,559
c cert what services they might expect

1696
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:40,880
that sector cser to provide

1697
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,640
what level of service or quality of

1698
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,040
service it might be expected to provide

1699
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,559
how much interaction that might they

1700
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,799
might expect to have with it

1701
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:50,720
so you gather as much information as you

1702
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:51,680
can

1703
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,680
from all the stakeholders

1704
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,559
and then in step three you organize that

1705
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,799
information and you start to evaluate

1706
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,799
where the gaps are

1707
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,319
now throughout the framework we talk

1708
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:05,280
about two states the as is state and the

1709
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,799
2b state

1710
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:09,359
the as is state is where you start off

1711
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:12,000
where you currently are and the 2b state

1712
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
is your desired end state for your

1713
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,920
sector c cert what do you want to

1714
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,240
provide how capable do you want it to be

1715
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,839
how engaged do you want to be with the

1716
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:21,040
community

1717
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,040
in step 3 what you're doing is you're

1718
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,200
taking the information you've gathered

1719
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,520
and trying to understand where the gaps

1720
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,400
are between your as is state and your 2b

1721
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,440
state

1722
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,559
in step 4 you simply build a roadmap to

1723
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:36,880
get from as is

1724
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,960
to to be

1725
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,880
we have a lot of resources in step four

1726
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,799
about how to build a roadmap what it

1727
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,319
should include

1728
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,880
and how you might start to think about

1729
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:47,839
um

1730
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:49,839
implementing it and then that of course

1731
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,839
leads into step five which is

1732
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:54,160
implementing that roadmap and planning

1733
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,799
and actually building your sector c cert

1734
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:58,559
this is often where we see countries and

1735
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,480
teams get tripped up we see development

1736
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,119
teams kind of get stuck on this part of

1737
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,400
the process

1738
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,240
because this is the really challenging

1739
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,599
part this is where the rubber meets the

1740
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,599
road and you have to actually start

1741
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:12,240
developing a team you have to get people

1742
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,799
on board you have to build that trust

1743
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:16,160
you have to get buy-in from all your

1744
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,760
stakeholders

1745
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,440
so you can actually start implementing

1746
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,839
things make policy changes

1747
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:22,960
you know

1748
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,359
sign up actual agreements and start

1749
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:27,760
information flowing in your sector c

1750
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,039
server

1751
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:31,200
and then finally step six is conduct

1752
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,359
post implementation activities this is

1753
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,839
using metrics conducting lessons learned

1754
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,599
and preparing for a neck for another

1755
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:40,480
cycle where you may improve your sector

1756
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,799
c search functions or capabilities in

1757
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:46,000
the next round of development

1758
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,760
the last thing i just wanted to

1759
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,240
emphasize here is again circling back to

1760
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,480
that idea of

1761
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,920
understanding the national cyber

1762
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,640
security ecosystem and its importance to

1763
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,440
your sector csert or to

1764
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,359
building a sector-based incident

1765
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:03,440
response capability and again the

1766
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,440
national cyber security ecosystem that's

1767
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,680
just a term we use to describe all of

1768
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,680
the entities and all the stakeholders

1769
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:12,240
who have some stake in cyber security

1770
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,559
for your country national csr law

1771
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,359
enforcement regulatory bodies private

1772
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:19,839
sector academia all of these different

1773
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:22,319
people are really important part of that

1774
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:24,799
national cyber security ecosystem

1775
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:26,400
and when it comes to integrating your

1776
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,640
sector c-cert there are two really

1777
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,640
important topics that we address in this

1778
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,079
framework

1779
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:35,039
that are are critical considerations the

1780
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:36,640
first is understanding the role of the

1781
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,799
national sea cert

1782
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:40,559
and there are different cases here if

1783
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,960
you have a strong capable national sea

1784
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,160
cert if you have a nascent national

1785
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,000
c-cert or if you don't have a national

1786
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,520
c-search at all

1787
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,880
and

1788
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,640
those

1789
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:55,280
the ability to which or

1790
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,799
the abilities to which you can integrate

1791
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,799
the sector c cert into that national

1792
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,680
ecosystem often depends on the state of

1793
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,359
your national sea cert

1794
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:05,920
because it's such a critical body

1795
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:08,240
for maintaining those relationships

1796
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,760
between sectors and the rest of the

1797
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,480
ecosystem so you have to understand that

1798
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,640
and understand that role

1799
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,079
and then the second piece here is

1800
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:18,160
establishing trust again we've heard

1801
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,559
about establishing trust already today i

1802
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:22,480
just want to reemphasize that it's

1803
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,280
critically important when you're taking

1804
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,880
different stakeholders and different

1805
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,160
people from different parts of an

1806
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,000
economy and trying to get them to work

1807
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,280
together towards a common goal of

1808
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,880
cyber security

1809
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,720
you have to be able to establish trust

1810
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,680
so we have some ways to do that

1811
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,480
here in the framework and some resources

1812
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,559
so again that's all part of integrating

1813
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:46,240
into that very important national cyber

1814
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,559
security ecosystem

1815
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:51,520
uh so that's the framework um i'll post

1816
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,039
a link to

1817
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:56,319
the resource itself um in the chat but

1818
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,000
uh thank you john robert and thank you

1819
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,640
to the rest of the panel um

1820
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,559
i guess i'll take any questions or turn

1821
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:04,559
it back over to you john robert yeah uh

1822
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,960
thank you very much uh justin but it's

1823
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,079
awesome is that we just answer some of

1824
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:12,640
the questions and concerns that are

1825
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,839
happening

1826
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:16,000
with the national

1827
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,839
framework and a lot of discussion

1828
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:22,400
over what is the national caesar whether

1829
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,400
it's a sexual assault should we start a

1830
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,559
nationalist

1831
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:29,359
agency competition and etc

1832
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:33,200
and i would like also to point out uh

1833
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:37,119
mr sadawi and tradition speech

1834
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:40,079
where he outlined the national ecosystem

1835
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,640
of c-suite in tunisia and i'm sure that

1836
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,160
there are

1837
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,960
many related engagement

1838
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,760
within the african

1839
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,799
so

1840
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:52,880
uh thank you very much

1841
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:53,760
um

1842
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,079
so we heard about

1843
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:59,280
uh this c-shirt service framework the

1844
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,599
episode series from

1845
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,720
the secretary of infirmary

1846
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,359
maturity

1847
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:11,599
early this year also if my memory served

1848
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:13,680
me well

1849
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,799
itu put forward

1850
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:19,280

yeah

1869
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:08,799
okay so i'll go straight into um

1870
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:10,400
what i will describe to you is the

1871
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,880
journey that we have had as

1872
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,760
itu regional group for africa

1873
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,839
my colleague raqqa is not able to join

1874
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:18,880
us today

1875
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,039
but what we have worked on as the

1876
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:23,359
regional group for africa is tri

1877
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:26,000
which is an itu-t study group 17 which

1878
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,799
does secure standardization and security

1879
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:32,079
uh sort of telecommunication networks

1880
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:34,000
is that we have uh

1881
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,039
looked at i just recently approved

1882
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:41,680
standard which is x 1060 and x 1060 is a

1883
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:42,799
framework

1884
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:45,440
for establishment and creation and

1885
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,480
operation of a cyber defense center so

1886
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,680
this was particularly um you know

1887
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:54,319
came at the very right time um given

1888
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:57,599
that you know most of um the world went

1889
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:01,520
into online interactions whether it was

1890
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,000
in africa or other parts of the world

1891
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
and indeed the issue of cyber security

1892
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,400
was very critical for all of us

1893
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,200
so

1894
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:13,119
uh we looked at x1060 because x1060 as a

1895
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:14,480
recommendation

1896
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,760
gives um

1897
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,319
all the services that are assat should

1898
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:19,279
have

1899
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:21,198
so if assat

1900
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:23,040
then looks at all the services that are

1901
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,479
in the recommendation

1902
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:26,719
then indeed they would

1903
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:28,560
and some of the services which i've had

1904
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,479
my colleagues who have just presented

1905
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:33,839
are in the framework uh the x 1060

1906
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:35,198
recommendation

1907
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:38,158
so the xn60 recommendation we looked at

1908
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:39,600
it and

1909
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,799
indeed

1910
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:42,000
addresses

1911
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,479
various resolutions under the itu

1912
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:47,279
there's resolution 50 which deals with

1913
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:48,799
cyber security

1914
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:52,158
there's a resolution 54 which most of

1915
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:54,960
the organizations here have supported in

1916
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,640
terms of creation

1917
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,238
uh of an assistance to regional uh

1918
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:03,040
to sorry that is resolution 44 is

1919
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,839
actually the creation of

1920
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:06,560
regional uh

1921
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,000
groups uh and it is uh very exciting um

1922
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,238
in the initial panel we had uh dr

1923
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:13,279
badrill

1924
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:16,080
and we have interacted with dr badrill

1925
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,600
in um

1926
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,600
because oman had a contribution in itu

1927
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,359
study group 17

1928
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:24,399
on

1929
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:26,238
sat assessments

1930
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:28,719
and indeed what we're trying to do is

1931
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:31,279
actually the work that uh dr badrilla

1932
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,839
and his team in oman

1933
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:35,359
had tried to do

1934
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,759
and we have continued with that work as

1935
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:39,759
the regional group for africa

1936
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,920
actually we did have a meeting in tunis

1937
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,880
in april of 2019 and that's where the

1938
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,359
collaboration has continued

1939
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:50,399
with the arab states and as well as the

1940
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:51,839
african states

1941
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:55,120
so under resolution 44 is bridging the

1942
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,880
standardization gap

1943
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,719
and we have interacted with x-1060 and i

1944
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:03,520
believe it is uh professor klaus peter

1945
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,040
who mentioned

1946
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,520
or i'm not sure who mentioned before me

1947
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,280
that there's one thing about developing

1948
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,960
a framework but there's another thing

1949
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,159
developing

1950
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:15,520
the act actually implementing so once we

1951
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,440
started looking at extent

1952
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:21,520
1060 um you know we told okay read it so

1953
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,080
we are trying to read it so we read it

1954
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,760
uh because the person who wrote it is

1955
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,920
not the same person who implements it so

1956
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,520
what we're trying to do as the regional

1957
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,239
group for africa is implement

1958
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:34,960
x 1060 and

1959
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,920
indeed uh that will tie into resolution

1960
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,760
54 58 sorry over wtsc or the world

1961
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,840
telecommunication standardization

1962
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,560
assembly uh which is encouraging the

1963
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,840
national i mean creation of national uh

1964
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,000
incidence response teams

1965
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,920
so on that basis um we have uh

1966
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,280
thank you grace uh grace will display

1967
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,960
we had um

1968
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,640
we have had meetings um

1969
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,320
fast informally during the study group

1970
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:09,600
meetings

1971
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,600
the whole of 2020

1972
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,560
and beginning of 2021 the last meeting

1973
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,360
being

1974
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,199
in september

1975
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:20,239
august september and in the september

1976
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:21,199
meeting

1977
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:24,880
we are decided over study group 17. we

1978
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,800
decided to have an e-meeting of the

1979
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,280
regional group for africa and what is

1980
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,120
displayed on your screen now

1981
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,000
is a tutorial that was given to the

1982
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,120
group

1983
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,880
which happened

1984
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,360
at the africa telecommunications union

1985
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,400
meeting

1986
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,320
which was a preparatory meeting for the

1987
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,239
world standardization

1988
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:46,159
assembly which is taking place

1989
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:48,000
next year i believe

1990
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,640
um hopefully it will happen in geneva

1991
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,400
and just going on um

1992
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,000
to the next slide

1993
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,360
it's just uh

1994
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,199
what the framework is

1995
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:00,719
the scope

1996
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:03,040
and um

1997
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,040
just moving on quickly of course there

1998
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,120
has been you know definition of who we

1999
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,840
are targeting which is their cisos and

2000
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,120
csos

2001
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,400
and it's important for any standard to

2002
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,760
have a definition and a cdc in as

2003
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,360
defined by x-1060 is an entity within an

2004
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,000
organization that offers security

2005
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,960
services to manage cyber security risks

2006
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,440
to its business and activities so it

2007
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,120
doesn't really um

2008
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,679
limit that to just

2009
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:37,040
sats or national assets which is really

2010
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:37,920
a

2011
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,719
big forecast especially in africa but it

2012
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:42,880
focuses on anybody that is offering

2013
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,120
services security services has been

2014
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,840
mentioned there's psats the sectorial

2015
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:48,800
sites

2016
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,840
and it is so what uh we're looking at is

2017
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,640
the ca so being able to

2018
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,480
empower and support the cdc as

2019
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,320
in the sense that whether it is a team

2020
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,440
whether it is um you know a department

2021
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,400
whether it's a group of two people um

2022
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:09,199
and therefore assign assign as you know

2023
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:10,040
assign

2024
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,560
responsibilities um define what are the

2025
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,880
security functions and then we'll cover

2026
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,679
in more detail what the framework covers

2027
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:20,320
in terms of the cdc services and the

2028
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,800
basis of course of the cdc services that

2029
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,760
as cdc will select is on the basis of

2030
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,760
the policy or the business objectives of

2031
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,000
the organization

2032
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,960
so moving on um cdc as an organization

2033
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,960
um it's just

2034
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,000
the same

2035
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,679
you know um

2036
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:41,520
uh

2037
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,679
i mean well the picture is kind of the

2038
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:47,679
same but in terms of the ciso we need to

2039
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:49,440
commit to the business objectives of the

2040
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:50,719
organization

2041
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:52,960
and on the basis of that then define

2042
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,960
what are the security controls which are

2043
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,080
based on the

2044
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,640
business objectives um

2045
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,920
and then also you know to manage

2046
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,600
the cyber risks that the organization

2047
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,880
may face

2048
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:08,159
so the cdc is empowered by the ciso to

2049
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:10,560
define as we have said then the security

2050
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:13,679
services and i'll just move on quickly

2051
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:14,400
to

2052
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,640
if we can move on

2053
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,480
so as i've just said that the cdc is a

2054
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:21,120
broader uh i mean concept as we've just

2055
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,560
said whether it's whether it's a

2056
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,800
national asset a security operations

2057
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,600
center in an organization or the group

2058
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,920
or the committee that has been formed

2059
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,560
within an organization to protect it

2060
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:35,920
its business functions from cyber

2061
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,159
risks and therefore manage cyber

2062
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:40,400
incidences

2063
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,040
um

2064
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:46,320
so the framework um as has been said is

2065
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,000
the framework for creation and operation

2066
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,840
of the cyber defense center

2067
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,440
uh and this was passed as a

2068
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,679
recommendation in

2069
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:57,280
in april of uh this year 2021 and

2070
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,679
therefore we as the regional group for

2071
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:01,760
africa are trying to implement

2072
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,199
it and

2073
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:05,600
reaching out to

2074
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,560
reaching out to cdc's in africa we have

2075
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,719
had sessions where we have spoken

2076
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,840
whether to forums or associations uh

2077
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,000
within our region to

2078
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,840
kind of promote uh

2079
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,040
you know

2080
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,920
have an understanding of what is

2081
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,719
uh the standardization process that

2082
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:27,199
it come up to with standards basically

2083
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:30,960
what how does it function and um after

2084
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,040
you know understanding what how the it

2085
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,199
functions and specifically study group

2086
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:37,520
17 in terms of security

2087
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:40,320
uh what are their you know working

2088
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,640
parties you know just the structure and

2089
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,520
what um individual questions under study

2090
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:47,760
group 17 are addressing so there are

2091
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,679
three the framework this particular

2092
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:52,080
framework deals with you know three

2093
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,840
processes there's a build management and

2094
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,239
evaluation which has already been said

2095
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:59,040
maybe in earlier by my colleagues in

2096
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:02,480
other terms but there is a service list

2097
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,880
which is proposed or

2098
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,040
put into the recommendation and on the

2099
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,360
basis of the service list then a cdc can

2100
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,239
select a service catalog on the basis of

2101
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:14,880
course of this business activities then

2102
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,960
develop a service profile and a service

2103
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,520
portfolio which you can then put out and

2104
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,400
say this is the service that i offer

2105
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,199
then

2106
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:26,559
moving on um

2107
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:30,719
to the next slide

2108
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,360
um yes this

2109
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:36,239
uh as i've just said so you have the a

2110
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:38,239
whole catalog of uh

2111
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:40,400
sorry a service list which is quite

2112
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,960
large um actually the the category of

2113
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,960
services is a to i

2114
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,840
and then the first phase of course is

2115
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,199
based on a recommendation you know you

2116
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:50,800
can pick out certain services that you

2117
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,159
wish to provide as an organization and

2118
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:54,960
then

2119
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,960
that is the first phase

2120
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,679
and then in terms of

2121
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:02,080
organization specific you can then

2122
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,560
generate a service catalog and then go

2123
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,280
on to provide a service profile and a

2124
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,120
service portfolio which is specific to

2125
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,800
your organization

2126
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,800
um it's very interesting that we have

2127
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,040
just had

2128
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,000
you know the discussion of services

2129
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,880
whether it's as is or to be and the

2130
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,360
framework or the recommendation or the

2131
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,880
standard as you know is commonly

2132
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,199
referred to it means mini standard

2133
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:30,400
developing organization does provide

2134
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:33,679
the opportunity for the ciso or cso to

2135
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:36,159
you know categorize whether a service is

2136
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:37,840
available you know whether it's

2137
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,719
planned or you know not provided whether

2138
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:41,600
it is

2139
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,280
for example its basic standard or

2140
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,360
advanced whether it's in-sourced

2141
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,239
outsourced or unassigned and it was very

2142
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:49,120
you know

2143
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,000
very

2144
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,120
um encouraging to hear that togo by

2145
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:56,719
itself and has its own nationals in the

2146
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:59,679
national site so for for example for

2147
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,600
themselves they would be probably

2148
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,920
looking at how are starting already

2149
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,920
providing you know services which are

2150
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,640
all in sourced so that is

2151
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,400
you know as is would be you know they

2152
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,360
would probably have a score of uh three

2153
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:16,560
and two b are working towards developing

2154
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,880
a uh service portfolio

2155
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,280
and uh you know the national certain

2156
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,000
toggle so this is kind of the

2157
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,719
development that assad would go in you

2158
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:29,600
know cdc whether sat or stock or

2159
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,159
whatever team that is providing services

2160
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,480
within an organization would go through

2161
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:37,199
so moving on

2162
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:40,239
um so these are the service categories

2163
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:42,080
and they're quite a number so we have a

2164
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,120
to i

2165
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,440
uh one of course is strategic as has

2166
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,840
been said cyber security is not just the

2167
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,159
technical part there's the boardroom

2168
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,080
part where who are the decision makers

2169
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:55,600
providing the finances uh or providing

2170
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,760
the personnel who have to deal with this

2171
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,080
and then b is real time analysis deep

2172
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,880
analysis so i would invite you to go on

2173
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:03,600
to

2174
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,080
you know the the um

2175
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,640
the itu website and you know download

2176
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:09,920
the recommendation which is now

2177
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,320
available in english and french

2178
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,320
and um

2179
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,640
look at all the services as defined in

2180
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,719
the catalog i mean sorry in yeah in the

2181
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:21,120
service categories so each of these

2182
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:24,640
service category for example a has 13

2183
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,960
number of services so a cdc can select

2184
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,560
one of the 13 which it finds necessary

2185
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,239
to meet its objectives as an

2186
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:35,199
organization and one important one that

2187
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:38,960
has been said again is category i which

2188
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,800
is active relationship with external

2189
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,719
parties and that's where partnerships

2190
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:44,960
come in collaboration whether national

2191
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:48,000
international collaboration

2192
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,719
so the next slide i believe is a very

2193
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:52,080
detailed

2194
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,800
uh list of all the services as has been

2195
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,040
mentioned so we'll just pass by that

2196
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,520
because if you read uh take time to read

2197
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:02,080
the recommendation all the services are

2198
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,960
listed there and the idea is that you

2199
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,600
can select any one of the services under

2200
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,080
any one of the categories to provide

2201
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,639
depending on your organization's

2202
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:14,880
objectives or even whether it's a

2203
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,159
national objectives that you have

2204
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:17,840
identified

2205
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,480
as a service being required

2206
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,920
so um

2207
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,000
so as mentioned

2208
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,440
this is the tutorial that has been given

2209
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,159
to

2210
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:31,760
um you know participants at um

2211
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,280
regional group for africa meeting on the

2212
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,600
28th of september has also been

2213
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,560
presented to various forums in uh you

2214
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,159
know where we've had

2215
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:43,040
a discussion with for example

2216
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,440
um you know associations of cyber

2217
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,120
security

2218
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:50,320
we have had two sessions in kenya

2219
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,440
and

2220
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,280
presented to them

2221
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:56,719
as a means to at the end of the day

2222
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:57,920
look at

2223
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,159
the survey that we're going to look at

2224
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:02,560
later so as i've

2225
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,800
been said earlier by my colleagues there

2226
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,199
is a way that you can decide that maybe

2227
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:09,440
the service is deemed as a necessary

2228
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,400
basic or advance so we'll move on that's

2229
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,840
making the catalog now you're in the

2230
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,560
process of making the catalog

2231
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:17,600
and

2232
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,199
the next slide

2233
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:22,400
is the build process which is phase two

2234
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,880
making now the service profile

2235
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,040
and you know determining whether you

2236
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,440
have insults outsourced a combination of

2237
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:31,679
both in terms of provisional service or

2238
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:33,679
if it is unassigned

2239
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:39,040
then uh moving on is i believe the

2240
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,360
making now the portfolio as has been

2241
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,679
said you can then rate yourself in terms

2242
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:45,600
of setting the target and scores

2243
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,480
depending according to assignment status

2244
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,280
whether it is a plus five

2245
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,920
to a plus one or one which is not

2246
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,440
applicable in the sense that you have

2247
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:56,400
decided

2248
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,880
not to implement the service whether it

2249
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,080
is in sourced or outsourced

2250
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,880
and then moving on is the management

2251
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,120
process which has three phases

2252
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:09,520
and you could decide at the very

2253
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,679
beginning you know um

2254
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:15,679
in terms of this strategic phase uh

2255
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:17,280
in terms of accountability because

2256
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,440
indeed as a security officer you need to

2257
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,760
report to the management

2258
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,920
then in terms of operation maintenance

2259
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,760
introduction of the framework and indeed

2260
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,719
that's where the work somebody said just

2261
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:30,239
before me that that's where the rubber

2262
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:32,080
meets the road because there's a good

2263
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,840
you know there's how you define a

2264
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,679
service then at the end of the day is

2265
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:38,719
actually the implementation and then um

2266
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:41,120
phase three is the response phase

2267
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:44,000
where now you actually execute um

2268
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,560
and can then provide the service to the

2269
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:51,280
constituents as identified so um

2270
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,639
just um

2271
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:55,760
the next slide is now the management

2272
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,280
phase whether it can be

2273
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,400
long or

2274
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,600
short cycle and in terms of

2275
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,840
how quickly you

2276
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,480
iterate to actually the provision of the

2277
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,159
service so

2278
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:09,840
in terms of short cycle you're

2279
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:12,000
continually improving the services that

2280
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,679
you're providing in terms of people

2281
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:16,239
budget and systems then in terms of a

2282
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:19,120
long cycle is you know looking at it in

2283
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,480
the long term view

2284
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:23,679
and continually providing the strategic

2285
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:26,159
support required

2286
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:29,199
for the service to be available

2287
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:30,639
to the constituents that you have

2288
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:32,159
selected or the stakeholders that you

2289
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:35,520
have selected as to provide that service

2290
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:36,239
so

2291
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:37,920
um

2292
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,080
the next slide is the evaluation process

2293
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,560
as it has been said it's good to

2294
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,800
continually look back and at the

2295
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,719
services that you're offering find out

2296
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:47,920
whether you're actually meeting the

2297
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:50,000
objectives of the organization whether

2298
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,040
you're meeting the needs of your

2299
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,360
constituents and therefore as we have

2300
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,719
said you know you're looking at the

2301
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:56,719
service list you have selected come up

2302
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:58,239
with a catalog you come up with a

2303
01:23:58,239 --> 01:23:59,920
profile and at the end of the day you

2304
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,840
have a service portfolio at the end of

2305
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:04,320
the day you have to continually look at

2306
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,800
the gap analysis and identify whether

2307
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,440
there is need to introduce more services

2308
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,040
to fill in the gap or improve the

2309
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,600
services that you already have

2310
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:14,480
and then

2311
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:17,360
moving on after the evolution is

2312
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,199
basically now you have the whole

2313
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:22,080
framework implemented uh

2314
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:22,880
for

2315
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,360
you know as a cdc as a cyber defense

2316
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:29,120
center so this is i believe

2317
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,440
uh the last slide and what we have done

2318
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:35,840
on the basis of this framework is um

2319
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,800
then developed a survey and the survey i

2320
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,840
will post the link to in the chat box

2321
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,560
and the survey is looking at all

2322
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,400
you know basically as we have gone

2323
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,760
through all the services and asking

2324
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:53,920
ciso cso's um you know the team the

2325
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,320
committee which is providing security

2326
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,920
services

2327
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,320
how how they have implemented whether

2328
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,760
they have implemented you know looked at

2329
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,639
the service list gone to the service um

2330
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:07,280
catalog profile and developed indeed a

2331
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,360
service profile where they are at

2332
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,520
whether they're in sourcing outsourcing

2333
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14,480
or you know have not assigned um or they

2334
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,639
are planning to or are providing so with

2335
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:18,639
that information gathered

2336
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:20,239
under itut

2337
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:23,600
then we can look at opportunities as we

2338
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,040
have discussed earlier in the earlier

2339
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:27,760
panel for capacity development also

2340
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,840
international collaboration or regional

2341
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,960
collaboration to improve the cyber

2342
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:33,920
defense

2343
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,800
centers in africa indeed the framework

2344
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,800
is you know for implementation whether

2345
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,199
nationally i mean sorry globally it's a

2346
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:44,000
it's a international standard uh but to

2347
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,280
begin with we are looking at

2348
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:48,000
implementation in africa and then the

2349
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,040
survey will then be extended as required

2350
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:54,800
to other regions so um i believe

2351
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,040
that is it from me and if you have any

2352
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,239
questions

2353
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:01,440
then you can let me know so um before

2354
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,760

2358
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,120

thank you very much john robert that was

2380
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:03,600
really interesting i am a big fan of

2381
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,360
frameworks um

2382
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,600
back when i ran or or started building

2383
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,440
the cert uk we looked at all the things

2384
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,800
we could do and we did that sort of sort

2385
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,159
of a framework

2386
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:14,639
session and we looked at i think some 40

2387
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:17,679
or 44 different things services we could

2388
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:18,400
offer

2389
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:21,280
and we we nailed it down to four or five

2390
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:22,719
and i'm a big fan of really

2391
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:24,000
understanding what you do and

2392
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,840
understanding how to do it

2393
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,520
and then making sure that you do that

2394
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,840
really really really well it's much

2395
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,520
better to do a few

2396
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:34,320
small focused things that your your

2397
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,000
your your the people you work for your

2398
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,239
stakeholders have decided are important

2399
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:40,159
and that you do those really well rather

2400
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:41,679
than trying to do everything because

2401
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:44,080
that's really really difficult so big

2402
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,239
fan big fan of i mean the p certain the

2403
01:27:46,239 --> 01:27:48,000
differences between a product security

2404
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,840
team and an ordinary ordinary are using

2405
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:52,320
inverted commas the computer security

2406
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,800
team versus the the

2407
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,280
sector isaacs or cser not sector certs

2408
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,199
which i've worked with many for many

2409
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:01,040
times times in my life really important

2410
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,880
again and then finally joining that all

2411
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,719
together and the sim 3 maturity model i

2412
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:06,320
think is an absolutely

2413
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,400
it's just an outstanding way of moving

2414
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,639
forward measuring maturity and measuring

2415
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:12,480
your ability and your ability to measure

2416
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,880
that as you improve or if one thing

2417
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,400
happens deep through but you can measure

2418
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:17,520
that and actually have a good

2419
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,760
understanding so i'm a huge huge fan of

2420
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:20,639
that

2421
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:22,800
as said all of those things feed

2422
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,800
directly into what we call our second

2423
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,800
second mission statement of common

2424
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,800
language common understanding common

2425
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:29,679
common

2426
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,679
knowledge of what is good and so on so

2427
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:35,120
that's really important
