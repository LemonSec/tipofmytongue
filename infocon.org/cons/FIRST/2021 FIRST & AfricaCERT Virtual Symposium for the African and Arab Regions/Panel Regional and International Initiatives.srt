00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,319
[Music]

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,080
we have um

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,000
this panel is you know

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,080
quite special for me i'm privileged to

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,360
be here with you um i hope that we will

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,519
address regional and international

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,960
cooperation

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,960
we have distinguished panelists from

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,359
different perspectives uh

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,359
we will go through

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,760
you know a lot of interventions whether

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,519
from a perspective of regional

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,800
cooperation uh and bilateral cooperation

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,600
multilateral corporations we will try to

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,680
highlight uh during this panel the

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,600
importance of partnership uh the

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,440
different mechanisms that already exist

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,800
in africa

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,920
opportunities and definitely uh i think

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,000
we look forward to more participation

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,640
based on the outcome of not just of this

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,120
panel but the whole event and the

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,640
following events

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,280
let me start by introducing my dear

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,520
friend and colleague

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,079
mr adel suleiman from the african union

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,120
commission

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,039
we have been working together over the

29
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,159
past few years on the agenda for cyber

30
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,840
security in africa

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,400
in the framework of the african union

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,840
adel you have the floor

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,680
you are muted

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,960
please a mute yourself

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,240
sorry um

36
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,439
thank you very much dr sharif um i'm

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,240
really honored to be here with you guys

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,280
um uh as sheriff mentioned i think we've

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,840
been collaborating uh for the last few

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,520
years and i think this is a very good

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,799
opportunity

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,680
to

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,960
foster and strengthen this international

44
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,119
regional cooperation

45
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,880
in cyber space

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,090
so

47
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,280
[Music]

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,119
my name is adam salehman as mentioned by

49
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,479
dr sharif i am a senior policy officer

50
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,720
within the african indian commission

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,840
and the african union commission uh has

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,680
its um 2063 agenda and aspirations and

53
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,640
as well as also we are taking also note

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,280
of the un agenda

55
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,680
2030 and i think uh we uh concluded that

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,200
in order to

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,879
realize those uh

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,360
aspirations we need to leverage uh uh

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,800
digitalization

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,680
and i think for us digitalization is a

61
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,160
top priority

62
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,280
in fact

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,319
we

64
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,920
in 2020

65
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,160
we adopted a digital transformation

66
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,000
strategy for africa 2020 2030

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,480
and i think this is a multi-sectoral

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,760
strategy and in fact we are also now

69
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,599
developing sectoral strategy for

70
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,200
agriculture for education and for health

71
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,840
and commerce etc etc so and as well as

72
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,800
also uh if you uh maybe you are aware

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
that the african union also

74
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,159
is uh also adopting um the continental

75
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,080
free trade area

76
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,920
so i think the stakes are high for the

77
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,080
african union when it comes to digital

78
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,239
and and this is where cyber security

79
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,319
personal data protection becomes a

80
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,159
critical element in this equation

81
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,640
and the african union

82
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,159
because of that

83
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,560
we have cyber security as one of our

84
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,640
flagship project

85
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,239
for the commission

86
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,760
and i think um several actions were

87
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,519
taken by the african union commission to

88
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,720
make sure that

89
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,560
of course we have all this

90
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,280
initiative taken place on digital but we

91
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,440
need to make sure that um you know we

92
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,040
have a safe and trusted environment

93
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,440
and i think for that we are we are

94
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,040
trying our best to

95
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,120
to to make sure that

96
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,360
the trust is there within the community

97
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,879
the african community as well as

98
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,280
within uh in the region and also

99
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,040
globally

100
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,560
so

101
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,000
several initiatives that the african

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,640
union commission has taken i think

103
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,519
we

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,720
developed

105
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,519
the

106
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,680
cyber security uh convention at the

107
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,120
african union convention on cyber

108
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,519
security and personal data protection

109
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,959
and

110
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,879
it's not yet

111
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,640
entered into force

112
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,798
we have 10 countries who ratified the

113
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,199
convention we are still missing uh five

114
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,798
more countries and i think this is an

115
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,079
opportunity

116
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,240
for uh representatives from the african

117
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,199
countries to work with us in order to

118
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,520
make sure that the convention enter into

119
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,600
force because having a legal uh

120
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,639
framework i think this is one step to uh

121
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,560
for digital cooperation so that we speak

122
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,479
the same language uh uh on the continent

123
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,759
and um they uh also we have been

124
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,320
cooperating with also the uh

125
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,680
council of europe uh and and uh

126
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,759
every two years we organized the cyber

127
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,919
crime forum i think this one the last

128
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,639
one uh was done in june 2021 i think

129
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,040
some of you attended the forum uh and

130
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,280
thank you for all for your participation

131
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,400
and and

132
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,440
and input to the forum

133
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,960
we also working with gfc uh the gfc uh

134
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,039
global

135
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,199
forum for cyber expertise i think we're

136
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,080
working with them uh for some time

137
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,800
and in 2019 in fact we organized the

138
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,759
first african uh the first uh africa

139
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,479
located uh forum

140
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,680
and

141
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,000
i think we was it was a big event

142
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,759
because not only

143
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,960
it was a gfc uh annual meeting but also

144
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,160
there was um ungge representative the

145
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,520
ambassadors uh and also the open-ended

146
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,280
group they were there and there were

147
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,440
some consultations and i think it was

148
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,759
very fruitful discussion i think out of

149
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,800
this uh we were now we are in

150
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,560
implementing with gfc

151
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,120
uh capacity building initiative

152
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,360
for africa

153
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,000
and um also in tandem

154
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,759
just to make sure that

155
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,039
africa has the best advice

156
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,759
there because you know our team is is

157
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,600
not uh big in the african union

158
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,400
commission so what we did we established

159
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,720
the african indian cyber security expert

160
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,000
group

161
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,080
and i'm i'm happy to say that sharif is

162
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,840
one of our

163
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,960
leading

164
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,240
expert in the group

165
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,039
so i think the expert group has been of

166
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,440
great help and

167
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,960
we also when we talk about

168
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,639
digital cooperation

169
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,280
we also they are also active uh in the

170
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,520
un processes and i think this is it

171
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,080
gives us an advantage because sometimes

172
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,360
we're in the african union commission

173
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,680
there may be a conflict uh in terms of

174
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,000
scheduling so we have them attending

175
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,639
this uh and some of them were actually

176
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,759
members of the gde uh and and as well

177
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,680
they've been also constantly uh

178
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,199
attending the um

179
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,919
the uh open-ended uh and

180
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,240
working group and providing providing to

181
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,440
us some advice uh on cyber related

182
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,840
issues and i think we see that

183
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,680
as a very

184
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,280
important step that we have taken in

185
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,840
2019 and i think we've been working and

186
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,919
we continue working i think some of the

187
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,280
fruit of this

188
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,960
effort is that together with the

189
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,560
african union cyber security expert

190
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,759
group we were able to develop a

191
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,960
child online policy for africa it's a

192
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,680
draft but still i think we are going now

193
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,400
to the next phases of the draft we have

194
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,639
we will have some consultation with the

195
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,800
regional stakeholders that eventually

196
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,280
will go out to the member state and will

197
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,800
be adopted

198
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,840
by the

199
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
au

200
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,240
organs we also looked at the malibu

201
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,280
convention because we saw that countries

202
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,160
we don't have the enough ratification

203
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,400
so we thought maybe we have to take a

204
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,919
proactive measure to look at the level

205
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,400
of convention and see where it can be

206
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,080
improved uh

207
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,319
in the event that the model convention

208
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,720
is ratified is fully ratified then we

209
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
can introduce some of this amendment to

210
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,400
the convention so that it gives more

211
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,280
countries uh comfort to ratify the

212
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
convention um

213
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,800
also we are working now on the uh

214
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,400
continental side the security strategy

215
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,240
for africa i think this is a huge

216
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,879
undertaking but i think we are

217
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,800
we are also having task force uh

218
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,479
working group uh on that and we hope uh

219
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,479
by 2022 sometime in 2022 we will be able

220
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,760
to uh

221
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,039
to to have the draft uh uh

222
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,559
the uh strategy uh and and also going

223
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,200
through au process for adoption

224
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,399
um

225
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,080
i i don't want to take a lot of time but

226
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
also we have been cooperating with

227
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,760
some regional actors

228
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,640
uh where we uh for instance with the

229
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,320
european union commission

230
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,480
we have this initiative called freedom

231
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,240
policy and regulation initiative for

232
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,600
digital africa

233
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,800
where we are doing um several things

234
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,959
on digital to prepare

235
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,600
you know the groundwork for uh digital

236
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,839
africa and eventually

237
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,080
the uh single market for africa dividend

238
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,000
market for africa

239
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,160
and as i mentioned now cyber becomes

240
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,839
very critical because we are doing all

241
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,240
this initiative and

242
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,160
if we don't have trust within the

243
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,040
continent and we don't have confidence

244
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,920
then

245
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,560
then these initiatives are doomed to

246
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,880
fail so i think this is why cyber

247
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,120
security becomes a critical component i

248
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,360
will stop here and i'll be glad to take

249
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,760
questions thank you very much

250
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,080
thank you adel uh i really appreciate

252
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,200
we'll get back to discuss them

253
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,240
during the intervention after uh we have

254
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,880
we take the the i mean another two

255
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,480

the ito has done quite a bit when it

261
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,480
comes to information technology at the

262
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,640
international level of course we all

263
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,839
relate to the ws the world you know uh

264
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,200
high level distinguished event wsis that

265
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,240
actually it was in geneva and then in

266

283
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,839
managing

284
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,160
all itu sub security activities in the

285
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,839
continent

286
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,320
and it's a very good place for us to uh

287
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,920
be part of this gathering that for us is

288
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,480
very important to um

289
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,760
um enhance the cooperation and also find

290
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,839
some synergies for all the stakeholders

291
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,320
of the ecosystem in the continent to

292
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,640
make sure that we are um

293
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,600
let's say acting on the

294
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,920
an efficient way

295
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,800
um

296
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,079
as you know the cyber security portfolio

297
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,880
program in itu is very broad

298
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,120
uh but today i will just um focus on

299
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,360
what we are doing really on the sub uh

300
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,440
on the search area

301
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,639
uh and uh

302
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,480
we we still

303
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,320
uh we're still updating our approach to

304
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,079
assist the countries

305
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,560
uh because i think that we can agree

306
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,800
that we are facing challenges in the

307
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,079
continent

308
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,720
uh we have lack of uh

309
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,560
local expertise

310
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,240
and relational structure in cyber

311
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,360
security

312
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,440
we have a lack of skills to respond and

313
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,399
manage

314
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,880
subsequent incidents

315
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
we are

316
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,519
challenging when we are challenged when

317
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,399
we need to

318
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,360
really

319
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,720
have deep and uh impactful development

320
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,800
even if we have some

321
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,959
funds available

322
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,320
and lastly we have lack of trust and

323
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,160
confidence in ic2 and ict adoptions

324
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,519
and to address these challenges uh we

325
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,600
are trying to um

326
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,360
keep

327
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,680
adjusting our search program

328
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,240
to really stock take the current

329
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,680
incident responsibilities in the

330
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,959
continent to establish

331
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,240
organizational structures

332
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,399
to improve its development in essence

333
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,560
response to continent

334
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,600
and

335
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,399
also

336
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,720
enhance the different submission and

337
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,600
also the stakeholders engagement

338
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,240
going through awareness creation and

339
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,560
promoting um really the cooperation

340
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,639
and to do so we we we our we we in

341
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,360
actually we developed kind of one called

342
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,680
active framework that's really based on

343
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,600
the services framework that first is

344
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,079
promoting and also

345
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,760
adjusting on the needs of our member

346
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,959
states

347
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,519
and this framework started by the third

348
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,720
assessment

349
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
where we're really

350
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,199
assessing the realness of in of the

351
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,000
country to establish national assert but

352
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,079
also more importantly preparing the

353
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,519
relevant

354
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,839
relevant stakeholders and needed

355
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,839
involvement for them to get a success of

356
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,000
self-implemented

357
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,760
and from from this assessment where

358
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,519
we're developing the

359
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,800
design

360
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,120
document agree design document and from

361
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,320
there we are going to establishment and

362
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,399
enhancement phase of the of the of the

363
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,440
cell

364
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,760
and really why we are

365
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,000
developing this framework is really to

366
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,600
explain

367
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,519
how what our approaches our approaches

368
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,880
prevent serves

369
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,600
um we started limiting search continents

370
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,920
2011

371
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,880
i think

372
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,040
and uh we realized that we need really

373
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,320
to um

374
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,880
keep adjusting the approach to make more

375
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,800
sustainable research

376
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,839
and uh so this framework is really to um

377
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,079
fix this issue and also

378
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,959
um to present clearly the structure on

379
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,959
how the product is faced

380
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,120
and also to clarify the score and

381
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,279
responsibilities and efforts

382
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,480
to make sure that the software

383
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,760
implementing is uh able to

384
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,360
act as

385
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,399
a first and central pollution point in

386
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,959
the country of attenuation or

387
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,320
in the country national or regional

388
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,920
level

389
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,079
and to identify be able to identify and

390
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,600
different response

391
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,360
to and manage this project

392
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,959
so as i was saying

393
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,800
um we so far

394
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,480
did about 36 assessments of countries in

395
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,880
the country in the continent

396
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,920
and

397
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,360
we tabulated about 11 certs

398
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,720
and we

399
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,600
are

400
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
now financing

401
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,160
uh let's say we just analyzed gambia and

402
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,399
we are implementing burundi and malawi

403
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,360
and

404
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,320
we are assisting kenya constantly

405
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,600
enhanced the

406
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,680
buildings insert at communication

407
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,360
authority

408
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,800
um

409
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,320
the new approach that we have also in

410
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,000
research is really to talk to the

411
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,399
stakeholders in the continent that to

412
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,399
see where we can find some tillages and

413
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,560
put together the resources so we can

414
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,240
build some more

415
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,120
i say powerful impactful cert on the

416
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,519
continent on the countries and for

417
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,759
instance for burundi we have some

418
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,880
education for some

419
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,079
some countries

420
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,519
uh for instance uh chad

421
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,120
and uh

422
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,199
and now it's watini we have connection

423
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,639
with some other partners where we

424
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,800
discuss

425
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,759
we are um looking for the

426
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,000
the way to find some scenarios where we

427
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,279
can complete each other to make for more

428
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,160
impactful cells

429
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,759
i will

430
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,759
uh conclude by talking about disabled

431
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,160
drills that we are

432
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,560
running um since 2014

433
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,320
um we um

434
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,279
conducted more than 30 exercises and for

435
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,360
more than 100 countries

436
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,720
and in africa we have we

437
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,360
had disabilities in zambia rwanda

438
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,560
mauritius

439
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,079
tanzania kadiwa and uganda

440
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,760
and what we are really promoting during

441
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,480
these habitats is the collaboration

442
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,319
the um

443
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,679
partnership between the sun and the

444
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,319
country so they can create a kind of

445
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,359
channel of discussion and plenty sharing

446
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,880
to make sure that the soil that we are

447
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,720
in the continent are really talking to

448
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,599
each other are sharing expertise to be

449
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,079
more efficient when it comes to dealing

450
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,679
with separate incidents in the in the

451
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:30,960
continent

452
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,440
and we um this

453
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,120
because of the quebec we had um

454
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,600
this to last year global sovereignty

455
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,840
um but next year we're really looking

456
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,679
forward to have regional secretary for

457
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,520
africa we're still looking for the cross

458
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,360
country but it's something we plan uh

459
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,880
very soon

460
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,280
and for 2021 we

461
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,480
we had a regional ceremony for western

462
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,080
africa it was

463
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,080
and next week we having the national

464
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,880
service wheel for

465
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,720
and i think the second slice player is

466
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,320
the one who's invited the participant

467
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,640
and it's good that uh you also attend to

468
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,880
see what's happening on on this server

469
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,720
rates

470
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,520
so uh to conclude i will just call upon

471
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,760
um really more coordination and

472
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,039
synergies

473
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,799
for a better use of

474
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,960
available resources in the continent

475
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,400
because we have so much we need to just

476
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,880
need to make sure we are using them in a

477
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,840
better way our

478
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,160
on innovation ways of funding served for

479
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,120
better sustainability i think that uh we

480
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,200
got uh when we were doing the secretary

481
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,000
for it was a good example of togo i saw

482
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,799
that the qualification is there um i

483
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,640
think it will be sharing with us this

484
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,520
really

485
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,640
brilliant

486
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,799
and good initiative

487
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,480
um i also um call for more collaboration

488
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,320
and close sharing between search in

489
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,039
africa is something we need to improve

490
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,840
really to make sure that we have this

491
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,440
pronunciation platform like really

492
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,120
running smoothly

493
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,320
and lastly to create and improve

494
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,440
a strong cyber security

495
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,760
industry in the continent

496
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,320
this will conclude my remarks for this

497
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,720
moment thank you

498
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,039
um thank you very much serge for sharing

499
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,200
with us uh you know quite a broad

500
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,640
spectrum of activities within the itu uh

501
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,200
if you allow me also i'll get back to

502
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,679
some of the other activities in addition

503
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,840
of course to addressing your points

504
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,400
you highlighted the the i mean the

505
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,640
importance of networking cooperation how

506
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,039
the iq is taking a central role when it

507
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,200
comes to cyber drills

508
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,080
and

509
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,760
how to build you know this type of

510
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,640
continuous effort of sustaining certs

511
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,760
and and

512
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,000
leading the you know the models for cert

513
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and the frameworks and at the same time

514
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,160
implementing it on the ground making

515
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,799
sure that they are built to be sustained

516
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,320
or and how to network you know partners

517
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,280
uh within africa and this is key to the

518
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,320
discussion that will come later on um

519
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,200
i'd like to pass the floor now to my

520
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,360
dear colleague and friend engineer

521
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,679
bedrock

522
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,480
he has been a really instrumental at all

523
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
levels at the i mean the

level uh he is leading in his home

526
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,240
country uh oman um oman has a very high

527
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,320
rank when it comes to cyber security

528
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,039
readiness in the global index um i mean

529
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,640
drafted and you know revisited every

530
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,679
couple of years by the itu uh he is also

region oman is hosting the arab regional

534
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,480
uh cyber security center and they have a

535
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
distinguished you know

536
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,000
event and more recently uh he has also

537

area as well as in oman

549
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,320
the type of lessons and experiences that

550
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,039
they have came across uh especially when

551
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,120
it was it involves regional and

552
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,880
international partnerships and how it

553
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
impacts you know cyber security

554
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,200
readiness and incident response engineer

555
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,400
bad the floor is yours

556
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,840

thank you very much again thank you to

560
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,159
first africa than to serve as a

561
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,919
representative a member of who i see

562
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,120
search for having me today with you uh

563

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,880
actually address the regional and

565
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,120
international cyber security initiatives

566
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,799
as dr sharif

567
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,000
mentioned

568
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,760
probably we were fortunate to wear

569
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,320
multiple hats when it comes to cyber

570
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,120
security initiatives on a gcc level oic

571
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,919
third level as well as uh

572
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,840
through the itu arab regional cyber

573
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,120
security center that we host in oman and

574
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,679
we extend the services and the support

575
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,159
to the rest of itu member countries and

576
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,559
cyber security so in such a short time

577
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,360
that is allocated for this session just

578
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,400
address few high-level initiatives

579
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,559
outlining

580
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,640
what is happening in the region and this

581
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,960
is on the aspect of cyber security

582
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,679
strategies capacity building incident

583
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,000
and threat management as well as cyber

584
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,919
security innovation

585
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,559
as well as the role of women in cyber

586
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,200
security where we are also having a

587
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,919
number of initiatives supporting that

588
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,640
so on an ic level three important

589
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,400
initiatives that we have introduced as

590
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,360
dr sharif mentioned that oic is quite

591
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,679
actually a large organization it is

592
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,440
considered to be the second largest

593
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,440
organization after united nations with

594
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,320
57 member countries and we were glad to

595
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,240
have active members and board members

596
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,280
like egypt where dr sheriff come from so

597
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,400
one of those

598
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,480
global initiatives we introduced within

599
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,799
the yc cert is the global sea

600
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,279
certification program which is actually

601
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,520
a holistic framework of cyber security

602
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,159
professional certification that outlines

603
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,400
the overall approach independent

604
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,799
assessment impartially of examination

605
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,120
competences of trainers identification

606
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,360
and classification of cyber security

607
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,880
domains and the requirement of

608
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,520
professional memberships

609
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,720
the recent

610
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,279
global initiatives that we also

611
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,440
introduced was the global cyber security

612
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,080
award which is basically one of our icc

613
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,000
initiatives to encourage international

614
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,320
collaboration in the domain of cyber

615
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,360
security the award recognizes innovative

616
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,760
cyber security projects from around the

617
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,640
world

618
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,600
not been bounded by country or region

619
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,320
that contributes to uplifting

620
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,440
the cyber security globally the theme

621
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,120
for this year was cyber security

622
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,679
innovation towards society prosperity

623
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,120
and well-being

624
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,960
and we have announced actually the

625
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,159
winners of this award which is uh

626
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,120
it includes also a financial award to

627
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,559
incentivize

628
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,400
more members actually to contribute to

629
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,080
this program and the winners were

630
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,400
announced during the recent icy third

631
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,159
annual conference

632
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,720
the oic annual cyber drill is an

633
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,200
opportunity for not only the search

634
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,080
within the oic cert member countries but

635
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,760
also it's been extended to other

636
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,919
regional platforms uh that we

637
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,559
collaborate with including first

638
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,360
africa service the episode and others

639
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,600
basically to have teams participating

640
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,039
and this is

641
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,320
again in line with the cyber drills that

642
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,720
are actually developed and implemented

643
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,360
by itu for different regions

644
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,720
on the gcc third level which is the six

645
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,880
countries as you are aware

646
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,720
we have actually

647
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,039
established a cyber security strategy

648
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,440
with a detailed business plan that is

649
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,000
updated every two years but two main

650
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,400
projects and initiatives on the gcc

651
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,880
level one was the gcc malware

652
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,960
information sharing platform and the

653
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,440
threat intelligence sharing platform

654
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,320
that has been made available to all gcc

655
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,279
countries to actually share

656
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,400
information on related threats malware

657
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,039
incidents that they are experiencing

658
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,960
allowing other countries to be more

659
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,120
proactive towards addressing such

660
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,440
threats before they become a target of

661
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,200
it

662
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,760
on the regional level and through the

663
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,799
itu regional cyber security center

664
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,240
actually we annually conduct a regional

665
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,559
cyber security week that has multiple

666
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,960
events including uh

667
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,120
conference as well as a regional cyber

668
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,240
drill

669
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,520
but annually also we run a regional uh

670
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,919
capture the flag competition this has

671
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,080
not only been made available to national

672
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,480
search but also targeting youth in the

673
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,919
arab region where we believe

674
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,279
youth

675
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,799
actually

676
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,120
considers to be uh

677
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,440
the largest probably part of the

678
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,679
population in the arab region and we

679
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,919
have been witnessing a good number of

680
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,679
innovative projects coming from the

681
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,000
region as well as good talents when it

682
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,120
comes to

683
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,840
threats hunting and

684
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,159
identifying vulnerabilities within

685
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,159
running applications and systems and i

686
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,480
mentioned in my earlier introduction

687
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,960
that we do also support and in original

688
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,559
initiatives that it's called women in

689
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,200
cyber security middle east which

690
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,919
actually addresses

691
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,279
the needs

692
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,799
in this domain to bring more female

693
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,279
we have probably quite a lack in that in

694
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,440
the region and we thought of

695
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,000
having a dedicated initiatives to ensure

696
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,640
that capacity building are also built

697
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,120
within the female community and we were

698
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,360
fortunate actually to have a number of

699
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,480
cyber security leaders now in the

700
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,279
gcc level that are women

701
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,520
considering my deputy

702
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,600
also the regional center and this is we

703
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,320
appreciate the trust giving by itu roman

704
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,880
has been selected to host the first

705
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,360
itu regional cyber security center that

706
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,960
is extending its

707
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,919
support and services to the 193 member

708
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,760
countries of the itu

709
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,679
after it started only with the arab

710
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,720
region and we have been actually running

711
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,960
around

712
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,440
170 plus projects and initiatives within

713
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,880
the region that varies between

714
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,240
developing cyber security strategies

715
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,840
for cyber security but there are

716
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,399
dedicated cyber security strategies for

717
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,399
online for child online protection which

718
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,960
we did in bahrain we have participated

719
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,520
also with itu in a number of regional

720
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,200
cyber security development workshop for

721
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,000
the asia region for the arab region as

722
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,720
well as for east europe region

723
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,840
technical assessment has been provided

724
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,480
to a number of countries as well as

725
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,960
actually the incident management we have

726
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,039
recently concluded the

727
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,679
establishment of palestine cert where we

728
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,320
have actually supported the country of

729
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,039
palestine to establish their national

730
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,720
search and we are working with other

731
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,960
countries also in the region to ensure

732
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,919
that

733
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,000
national cert at least are established

734
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
when it comes to capacity building we

735
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,760
all believe that humans as well

736
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,760
as they are actually the weakest link

737
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,000
but there are also the one we count on

738
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,240
when it comes to cyber security so we

739
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,720
have actually run a good number of

740
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,440
cyber security trainings and workshops

741
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,240
around 86 plus

742
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,320
additionally we work certainly with the

743
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,080
regional and other international

744
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,720
organizations like ferris where we were

745
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,039
actually privileged to have an mou

746
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,200
signed with first a few years back and

747
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,440
based on that we had to run a joint

748
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,520
symposium and workshop we started in

749
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,960
egypt in 2016 thanks to dr sharifah at

750
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,919
that time he was leading the egypt sir

751
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,840
one of the successful event tweeted with

752
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,120
first followed by another symposium

753
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,919
in

754
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,799
darsalam as well as in tunisia and

755
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,679
basically today's also even

756
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,399
in cooperation with tunisia that is also

757
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,520
a member of the oic so we believe that

758
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,399
uh

759
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,480
having such regional initiatives will

760
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,520
maximize the value approach uh to the

761
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,919
cyber security community

762
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,000
and it is an opportunity to share

763
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,440
knowledge experiences and actually to

764
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,480
enable

765
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,440
more uh collaboration across countries

766
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,640
and overcome uh the reinvent the wheel

767
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,679
concept and i would support surgeons

768
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,399
concluding the remark that we do really

769
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,399
encourage more of this collaboration and

770
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,120
we look forward to such joint events

771
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,159
that will enable every participant to

772
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,159
understand what is going on in every

773
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,240
region and then we decide how we can

774
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,240
make the best out of it to benefit the

775
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,320
entire community to make the world a

776
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,399
safe cyberspace with that i would

777
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,399
conclude my remark thank you very much

778
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,159

779
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,399

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,360
um yeah absolutely so i'll i'll just

855
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,360
start briefly by talking a little bit

856
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,159
about the us's commitment so first of

857
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,000
all the us is committed to strengthening

858
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,799
global cyber capacity build capacity to

859
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,320
protect and promote an open

860
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,960
interoperable and secure and reliable

861
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,600
internet open interoperable reliable and

862
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,440
secure those are the ways the words that

863
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,120
we use to describe the internet that

864
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,639
we're seeking

865
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,719
as vice president harris said in paris

866
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,560
in november the united states is

867
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,119
committed to working to advance security

868
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,520
in cyberspace to promote stability in

869
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,800
cyberspace and to ensure

870
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,199
ensure shared prosperity

871
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,119
so this includes our continued

872
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,040
partnerships with governments private

873
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,280
sector civil society and the technical

874
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,079
community around the world to advance

875
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,879
cyber security partners capacity on a

876
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,639
range of cyber issues

877
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,399
for more than a decade the department of

878
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,159
state has leveraged diplomatic

879
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,320
engagement and foreign assistance to

880
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,879
help our partner nations develop strong

881
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,399
cyber capacity

882
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,119
since 2012 actually we've been directly

883
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,040
involved um in capacity building in the

884
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,280
middle east and africa our very first

885
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,719
whole of government training for

886
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,040
partners was in accra ghana in

887
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,680
collaboration with ekowas and uh we

888
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,320
haven't stopped running since our

889
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,400
capacity building work covers five major

890
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,440
themes

891
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,520
first we assist governments to develop

892
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,440
and implement national cyber strategies

893
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,800
and effective whole of government

894
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,960
approaches to policies relating to cyber

895
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,839
space so national strategies second we

896
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,160
work to strengthen national incident

897
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,320
management capabilities and protect

898
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
critical infrastructure so that's

899
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,800
primarily been our work with c certs

900
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,359
that we've sponsored with sei

901
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,280
third we work to combat cyber crime

902
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,560
through the promoting the budapest

903
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,640
convention and providing practical legal

904
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,560
training and i'm not the one who usually

905
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,880
does that that's my colleagues who have

906
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,680
experience in law enforcement issues

907
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,079
fourth we work to promote

908
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,320
private public sector collaboration

909
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,920
including on things like cyber security

910
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,079
standards and finally we work to build a

911
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,839
culture of cyber security through

912
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,640
awareness and workforce development um

913
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,280
and in africa and the middle east we've

914
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,040
primarily worked on the first three of

915
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,359
those topics um we've worked with uh

916
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,040
sponsored a group called the mitre

917
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,680
corporation to help a few governments

918
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,800
and um

919
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,560
groups in regional organizations and

920
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,880
this is what um adil was talking about

921
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,680
um in 2018 for example we joined an

922
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,000
event that the african union convened

923
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,599
and we brought some experts to talk

924
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,000
about drafting national cyber strategies

925
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,680
um and then we've done a fair amount

926
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,119
with the software engineering institute

927
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,800
and the good news is that you're gonna

928
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,280
hear from justin directly i think later

929
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,440
on in the program about the work that

930
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,920
they're doing um

931
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,640
and uh you know we've been we've also

932
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,359
convened some regional training focused

933
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,760
on risk-based based approaches to cyber

934
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,599
security so think about your cyber

935
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,280
security not from a technical

936
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,119
perspective but from a

937
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,800
whole holistic perspective and you're

938
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,480
going to hear a little bit about those

939
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,560
approaches i think later on

940
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,800
um and we've also so in addition to our

941
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,119
capacity building we've engaged partners

942
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,880
in the middle east and africa on issues

943
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,280
of international security in cyberspace

944
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,119
including raising awareness of the

945
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,960
framework of responsible state behavior

946
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,359
in cyberspace and this is uh what dr

947
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,359
sharif was talking about

948
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,599
there have been a round of negotiations

949
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,440
at the united nations that he

950
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,000
participated in at one point um there

951
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,800
have been i think five or six group of

952
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,440
governmental experts uh where select

953
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,440
governments from across the world

954
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,839
self-nominated governments from across

955
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,480
the world sent an expert to negotiate at

956
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,880
the united nations about

957
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,680
work that we could do together to reduce

958
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,160
the risk of conflict in cyberspace

959
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,760
in addition to that um beginning in 2019

960
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,320
there uh was an

961
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,400
open-ended working group also convened

962
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,200
by the united nations also under the

963
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,359
work that they do focused on disarmament

964
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,640
and peace

965
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,160
and that open-ended working group was

966
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,359
open to all

967
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,079
and uh in this spring both uh the

968
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,520
current gge

969
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,839
and uh that open-ended working group is

970
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,000
open to all the open-ended working group

971
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,800
is open to all un member states so if

972
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,280
you if all governments that are members

973
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,240
of the un were invited and encouraged to

974
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,240
participate in those negotiations

975
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,040
whereas the gge is is select select

976
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,119
governments to nominate an expert and so

977
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,040
there are kind of complementary tracks

978
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,599
you might think um both of those had a

979
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,359
negotiation round that concluded in this

980
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,960
spring and they affirmed three things

981
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,880
as well as what i think of as an

982
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,000
underlying underlying support

983
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,359
the they affirmed a framework of

984
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,920
responsible state behavior in cyberspace

985
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,920
that includes an affirmation that

986
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,640
international law that exists already uh

987
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,119
things like the un charter apply to

988
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,440
the activities that governments do in

989
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,640
cyberspace

990
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,400
secondly they affirmed a list of norms

991
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,880
of responsible state behavior that good

992
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,720
governments operating in good faith

993
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,720
should do these things or should not do

994
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,040
these things in peace time these are

995
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,680
voluntary but they sort of outline um

996
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,160
the rules of the road uh the things that

997
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,240
are uh good behavior or are not good

998
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,640
behavior um and then the third piece of

999
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,400
the framework that has been offered

1000
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,160
multiple times including this last

1001
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,880
spring is uh the value of practical

1002
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,760
confidence building measures so um

1003
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,079
things as basic as exchanging points of

1004
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,560
contact so that if there's an incident

1005
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,440
of concern uh governments can reach out

1006
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,359
to one another and know who to reach out

1007
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,160
to um and i bring this up uh in part

1008
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,280
because um in part because uh

1009
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,359
there's a specific norm of responsible

1010
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,119
state behavior in cyberspace that

1011
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,280
relates to the work of c-certs and i'm

1012
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,119
gonna read it it's in diplo speak so

1013
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,560
then i'll kind of explain it a little

1014
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,599
bit um but the the norm it was first

1015
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,000
outlined in 2015 and it has subsequently

1016
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,079
been reaffirmed both at the open-ended

1017
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,839
working group so all u.n member states

1018
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,240
and also at the most recent u.n group of

1019
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,359
governmental experts and the norm says

1020
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,079
states should not knowingly or could not

1021
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,960
should not conduct or knowingly support

1022
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,359
activities to harm the information

1023
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,839
systems of the authorized emergency

1024
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,839
response teams sometimes known as

1025
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,000
computer emergency response teams or

1026
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,160
cyber security incident response teams

1027
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,520
of another state

1028
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,440
a state should not use an authorized

1029
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,839
emergency response team to engage in

1030
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,240
malicious international activity

1031
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,680
so this is what we call a normal

1032
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,599
restraint uh

1033
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,839
this is a norm where governments that

1034
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,839
have signed up to it have said we're not

1035
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,400
gonna use our certs to

1036
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,359
do bad things to cause trouble to uh you

1037
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,839
know conduct malicious activity we are

1038
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:38,960
gonna

1039
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,160
recognize

1040
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:40,960
that

1041
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,440
caesars have a special role to play um

1042
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,960
this norm is a recognition that the

1043
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,400
united states and the broader

1044
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,319
international community have identified

1045
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,640
the role of sea certs as essential and

1046
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,040
deserving of protection in fact many

1047
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,640
states categorize sea surge as part of

1048
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,400
their critical infrastructure

1049
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,240
and the norm recognizes the importance

1050
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,760
of protecting sea certs when they are

1051
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,599
providing incident response and network

1052
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,760
defense services to the public

1053
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,079
and and i'd also note that if sea certs

1054
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,680
do engage in malicious international

1055
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,280
activity they wouldn't be eligible for

1056
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,440
protection under the norm right it's a

1057
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,160
it's a norm of mutual commitment

1058
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,480
um i realize i'm probably running out of

1059
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,440
time so i uh will

1060
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,040
you know i will just say that our

1061
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,319
capacity building efforts

1062
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,359
internationally and in the region um are

1063
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,200
generally in line with supporting this

1064
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,960
framework um they're always in line with

1065
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,960
supporting this framework um and

1066
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,880
sometimes they're directly about you

1067
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,800
know engaging people's awareness of the

1068
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,880
framework and um sometimes they're about

1069
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,640
diving into specific pieces of the

1070
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,480
framework um or just supporting

1071
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,359
cybersecurity capacity in part so that

1072
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,400
governments can commit to and and follow

1073
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,520
the framework

1074
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:47,910
um

1075
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,520
[Music]

1076
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,359
i want to be respectful of people's time

1077
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,560
i'll just say that we do have some

1078
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,960
capacity building programs for c cert

1079
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,079
that we're sponsoring the software

1080
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,000
engineering institute to do

1081
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,520
in the region um particularly primarily

1082
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,960
in africa

1083
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,839
and i'm also going to put in the chat a

1084
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,520
little bit a couple

1085
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,680
places that i would encourage all

1086
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,200
c-certs to

1087
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,240
look to for information particularly the

1088
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,880
u.s department of homeland security

1089
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,400
offers uh

1090
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,240
subscription feeds for threat

1091
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,480
information and i would encourage folks

1092
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,960
to sign up for that and um also we have

1093
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,560
the homeowner's security information

1094
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,200
network which is a nomination you must

1095
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
apply to be part of but it can be a

1096
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,520
great way for your team to get

1097
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,040
information about threats that are

1098
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,000
timely

1099
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,680
and have them sort of automatically

1100
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,240
deliver to you so with that i'll hand it

1101
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,000
back to the chair and i look forward to

1102
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,599
questions

1103
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,599
thank you very much elizabeth you shared

1104
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:48,640
with us

1105
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,000
you know

1106
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
a lot of activities across different

1107
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
levels whether at the international

1108
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,040
level

1109
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,119
i'm really glad that you highlighted i

1110
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,640
was counting on you to highlight you

1111
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,440
know the links between the norms of

1112
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,040
responsible state behavior and the

1113
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,720
confidence building measures that are

1114
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,119
developed have been developed over the

1115
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,640
past uh you know over 10 12 years at the

1116
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,040
un level they are adopted by the general

1117
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,880
assembly of the united nations so that's

1118
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,359
the broadest group of adult a group of

1119
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,760
adoption really and it provides an

1120
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,960
umbrella and reflecting back to uh our

1121
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,880
colleagues working here and you know at

1122
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,839
different serves instant handlers

1123
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,240
there is a you know a special place for

1124
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,280
you to make them happen uh talking about

1125
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,280
norms it happens uh

1126
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,200
and the confidence building measures it

1127
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,680
happened at a high level where mostly i

1128
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,000
mean they are led by diplomats uh you

1129
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,319
know government officials international

1130
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,920
lawyers uh experts you know uh

1131
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,079
you know working with the un at all

1132
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,880
levels however uh they have already

1133
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,720
opened up you know with the open-ended

1134
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,440
working group to organizations and first

1135
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,520
where was invited to be part of the

1136
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,440
organizations addressing the open-ended

1137
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,599
working group and communicating with the

1138
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,560
ungge group of governmental experts in

1139
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,560
fact uh i i know that when i represented

1140
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,240
you know egypt uh

1141
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,920
the ungge in 2012 2013 i was the only

1142
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,160
representative from uh africa and the

1143
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,640
middle east and i lobbied to expand this

1144
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,880
and thanks to the us and other partners

1145
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,880
the uk

1146
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,680
and most of the group you know endorsed

1147
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,839
you know expanding that group and even

1148
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,119
opening up uh you know the process to

1149
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,680
include professional organizations like

1150
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,400
first

1151
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,480
and we were part of this and currently

1152
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,800
we have a member of the organizing

1153
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,599
committee who is a current um ge member

1154
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,200
and we have been invited to the

1155
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,160
open-ended working group as well so uh

1156
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,920
it's it's really a pleasure to address

1157
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,960
this because there is something at few

1158
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,119
points actually that are quite relevant

1159
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,920
not just one norm all the cdns about

1160
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,760
about you know building confidence ahead

1161
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,760
of time you know you don't build

1162
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,000
confidence during a crisis time you

1163
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,240
build confidence ahead of a crisis

1164
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,640
hopefully no crisis is i mean

1165
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,280
we don't face a major crisis that would

1166
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,040
require you know international

1167
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,920
interventions but you know day-to-day

1168
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,400
challenges that we face

1169
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,119
you mentioned in your talk uh you know a

1170
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,359
little bit about you know the feeds that

1171
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:24,720
are provided

1172
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,200
uh you know to countries and feeds about

1173
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,000
possible threats you know attack vectors

1174
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,839
that are spreading

1175
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,240
so quite a few points that we'll get

1176
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,400
back to i'd like to open the floor for

1177
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,119
to take some questions and i have some

1178
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,160
questions of my own uh to address uh i

1179
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:42,960
mean

1180
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,119
to my colleagues

1181
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,880
at different levels uh um maybe i i'll

1182
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,800
start with general questions but let's

1183
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,880
pose if and see if we have questions

1184
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,599
from the floor first

1185
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:06,480

so with this said

1190
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,160
let me start by

1191
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,720
you know having

1192
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,680
some few points maybe addressed we were

1193
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,960
discussing now let's uh you know uh move

1194
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,240
along the same lines of the

1195
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,800
international collaboration uh with the

1196
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,200
process of the ungge the open-ended

1197
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,760
working group the african union also

1198
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,240
has opened channels different you know

1199
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,839
scenarios for uh you know uh discussing

1200
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,119
norms uh confidence building measures uh

1201
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,760
and also trying to have some synergy

1202
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,520
between african countries when it comes

1203
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,720
to adopting you know the the legal uh

1204
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,319
framework the regulatory framework uh

1205
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:01,839
can you highlight you know the

1206
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,839
importance of you know this type of

1207
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,720
synergy and coordination that happens

1208
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,640
within the african union activities

1209
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,960
so that i mean in africa we are aware of

1210
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,960
what's happening elsewhere at the same

1211
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,000
time we can reflect back on our

1212
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,160
individual countries and regional

1213
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,680
activities

1214
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,240
uh thank you very much dr sheriff as you

1215
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,839
mentioned there are so many things to go

1216
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,040
on cyber

1217
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,880
and i think

1218
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,720
getting the priority right i think one

1219
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,720
of these one of the challenges

1220
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,839
um

1221
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,520
so um

1222
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,160
i think in just in general before i get

1223
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,760
to these questions

1224
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,200
so i think in general for the

1225
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,559
african-american commission the

1226
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,160
priorities are

1227
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:44,880
to

1228
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,640
help the countries i think we've been

1229
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,520
doing some work with the u.s

1230
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,359
strategies and i think we want to do

1231
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,119
that also at the regional level and at

1232
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,520
the continental level and also of course

1233
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,200
we not we want to raise awareness

1234
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,440
develop capacity and make sure that we

1235
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,119
have a legal framework

1236
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,480
um

1237
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,359
i think

1238
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:06,960
just i want to draw your attention that

1239
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,680
i think we had

1240
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,520
with the help of the u.s government we

1241
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,480
had um a regional consultation in the

1242
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,880
ecowas region recently

1243
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,079
where

1244
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,359
we tried to uh walk through the norms

1245
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,720
and see

1246
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,880
what is it that uh

1247
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,480
african countries would

1248
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,359
kind of

1249
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,680
take like priorities uh when it comes to

1250
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,599
the african norms so because i think

1251
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,839
this this i think we have to be careful

1252
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,960
here because

1253
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,200
uh you know we don't want to dictate to

1254
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,440
the countries what to do but i think we

1255
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,440
leave it up to the countries to decide

1256
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,359
what is what is it that

1257
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:46,839
they think it would be

1258
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:50,000
um an important element so so we are

1259
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,470
doing this

1260
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,040
[Music]

1261
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,520
we had the gge and open-ended working

1262
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,200
group and and

1263
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,559
they spoke at links on about the norms

1264
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,880
and

1265
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,880
confidence building budget

1266
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,839
and

1267
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,839
i think we are trying to work with also

1268
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,400
with the open-ended work group the gge

1269
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,520
to have regional consultations

1270
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,559
[Music]

1271
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,359
consultation so that uh you know first

1272
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:23,040
of all uh you know the policy makers are

1273
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,520
kind of uh they are up to speed with all

1274
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,760
these norms and why they're important

1275
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,680
because i think we need to sell that i

1276
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,520
think we don't have yet the political

1277
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,319
will

1278
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,280
uh across the board maybe it's here and

1279
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,200
there but it's not across the board so

1280
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,079
we need to make sure that we have this

1281
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,480
awareness raising and consultations with

1282
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,720
the african countries we are we

1283
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,040
unfortunately we did one but uh we

1284
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,359
didn't follow up with the uh

1285
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:52,000
gge and open-ended working group uh and

1286
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,359
we are looking forward i think we are

1287
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:57,040
doing also some work with the gfc but

1288
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,520
it's just a one-offs uh and we need to

1289
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,440
make sure that we do

1290
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,520
this thing consistently so that the

1291
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,359
country understand this is the priority

1292
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,440
this is something important uh because

1293
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,160
you know trust and and and confidence in

1294
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,400
ict is very paramount

1295
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,200
for us to make sure that we

1296
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,800
are implementing our

1297
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,720
priority when it comes to the digital

1298
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,880
space thank you

1299
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,800
thank you adele for sharing

1300
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,839
i think this is really quite useful for

1301
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:28,160
all of us to to keep in mind it's quite

1302
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,480
a challenging task and really having

1303
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,200
partnership makes it uh quite a bit

1304
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,000
easier uh i'd like to move to engineer

1305
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,960
better and and really our experience in

1306
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,440
in egypt and in the region african

1307
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,599
region every arab region has been you

1308
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,839
know the importance of building

1309
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,640
partnership and trust uh starts at the

1310
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,240
all levels you have you know annual

1311
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,720
events you have cyber drills

1312
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,240
cyber drills are very special to me um

1313
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,640
in egypt we started off by uh you know

1314
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,960
participating in the itu cyber drills

1315
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,680
the

1316
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,920
uh you know whether it's the arab region

1317
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,079
of the african region we also

1318
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,680
participated in the oic cyber drills and

1319
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,000
asia pacific egypt is not asia pacific

1320
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,640
but we got the partnership to work for

1321
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,920
us

1322
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,160
this helps the teams to work together to

1323
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,480
gain trust at the operational level what

1324
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,400
is your experience with

1325
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,880
trying to build trust among you know

1326
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,559
incident handlers

1327
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:29,680
ahead of time ahead of the need of you

1328
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,640
know

1329
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,200
requiring coordination in time of a

1330
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,599
crisis

1331
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,680
yes uh dr sharif

1332
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,960
i think being doing that for several

1333
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,800
years now and as

1334
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,520
you mentioned at different levels uh

1335
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,079
within the oic the gcc the arab

1336
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,079
countries as well as we do actually

1337
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,800
national cyber drills also for the

1338
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,079
government and the critical

1339
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,520
infrastructure

1340
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,599
we have actually realized that in

1341
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,720
addition to building the competences

1342
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,800
for teams to be much ready and prepared

1343
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,599
to address cyber incident it has enabled

1344
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:10,000
also the team to have

1345
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,559
a one-to-one communication and a

1346
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,640
one-to-many communication with the other

1347
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,119
representative of national search in the

1348
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,480
region that has enabled them to really

1349
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,440
have that convenient to to pick up the

1350
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,760
phone and talk to any colleague from a

1351
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,000
member country either to seek a help or

1352
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,640
support to address a specific incident

1353
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,480
or to share an experience that they have

1354
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,720
faced during an incidence that they have

1355
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,200
addressed at their domestic level so i

1356
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,680
have seen really quite significant

1357
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,079
improvement in the readiness

1358
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,480
of the countries in the region to

1359
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,720
address cybersecurity threats and

1360
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,040
challenges but it has also brought to

1361
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,000
our

1362
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,200
intention

1363
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,839
that we should not only limit actually

1364
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:56,960
such

1365
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,599
value to be only to the national search

1366
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,640
but we have also started engaging

1367
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,800
specific critical national

1368
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,400
infrastructure

1369
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,720
sectors to the annual drills that we are

1370
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,680
participating allowing them not only to

1371
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,400
participate actually in the drills but

1372
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,040
to share with us their experiences where

1373
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,760
we have find they were quite good number

1374
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,000
actually of talents and competences

1375
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,680
within the critical national

1376
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,760
infrastructure that they were

1377
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,200
willing also to share their specific and

1378
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,680
special type of incidents that probably

1379
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,640
they have not been seen in other sectors

1380
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,240
with the rest of the other countries

1381
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,720
participating in the other regions so i

1382
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,200
would say continuing with this will not

1383
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,280
only enable us actually to be in a

1384
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,760
better position to address cyber threats

1385
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,480
but it enables us also to become

1386
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,760
more proactive on uh

1387
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,520
assuring the trust in sharing

1388
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,880
information

1389
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,000
it gives the convenience and the comfort

1390
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:58,720
for

1391
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,440
all countries in the region to believe

1392
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,599
that information sharing is really

1393
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:04,960
powerful

1394
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,000
we have seen a quiet challenges

1395
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,680
using actually the word of

1396
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,839
confidentiality and sensitivity of

1397
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:14,800
information not to be shared with the

1398
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,880
other regions but through this drills i

1399
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,200
think everybody has witnessed that

1400
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,319
information sharing is actually helping

1401
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,319
individual countries not only other

1402
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:25,599
countries that they are sharing their

1403
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:26,960
information with

1404
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,559
so this is my

1405
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,079
kind of

1406
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,280
findings over uh the drills that we have

1407
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,880
done and it also encourages us actually

1408
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,000
to keep doing it in a way where it

1409
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,880
becomes also more innovative and

1410
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,079
predictive to address emerging threats

1411
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,559
with the fourth industrial

1412
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:51,040
revolution and the application

1413
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,440
application associated with it i think

1414
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,160
now we are going to address more

1415
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,400
different challenges than we used to do

1416
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,960
and we have also to consider that in our

1417
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,280
future cyber trends thank you

1418
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,760
thank you very much and i really uh

1419
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,760
support your idea especially during the

1420
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,160
covet time we have witnessed the global

1421
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,920
you know

1422
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,720
transformation rapid transformation if i

1423
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,760
may say towards digital digitalization

1424
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,559
whether it's in one sector or across

1425
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:23,040
different sectors in africa especially

1426
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,920
uh african countries relied on the ict

1427
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,200
in ways that

1428
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,640
were really uh only tapped upon no

1429
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,960
before the the pandemic but now it's

1430
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,280
everywhere in finance in education

1431
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,480
culture exchange uh healthcare of course

1432
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,640
uh industrial

1433
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,440
i mean and work environment so there are

1434
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,839
lots of applications now then many

1435
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:48,000
sectors and i really appreciate also

1436
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,160
sharing that you are now including the

1437
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,920
sectoral uh certs and instant handlers

1438
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,400
in such activities i'd like to move to a

1439
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,599
question that we got uh to the itu about

1440
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,400
the uh i mean again along the lines of

1441
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,799
building capacity human capacity and you

1442
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,440
know uh search address you addressed

1443
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,040
before uh you know the the lack of uh

1444
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,200
talents within africa and this is really

1445
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,799
important for us to build and i think

1446
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:16,559
many of the panelists also would share

1447
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,559
the same idea would you like to add

1448
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,920
something along these lines sir

1449
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:25,040
thank you

1450
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,680
to clarify beaten let's see

1451
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,599
the number one let's look in the figures

1452
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:32,000
we are about seven thousand certified

1453
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,920
professional in africa

1454
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,559
with a population of about 140 billion

1455
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:40,319
does this mean that we really

1456
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:42,079
need to um

1457
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:43,119
let's say

1458
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:46,000
improve and increase our position to be

1459
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,680
able to uh

1460
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,280
let's say

1461
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,760
build this task force

1462
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,599
to defend and to

1463
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:56,799
manage essence uh in the continent

1464
00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:00,640
um united we we really um thinking that

1465
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,520
uh

1466
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,040
this

1467
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,119
capacity building

1468
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,799
development

1469
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,680
policies or strategies should only be

1470
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,280
embedded on the national specific

1471
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,760
strategies and you will see that for

1472
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,119
instance we just launched the

1473
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:19,440
the second edition of the cyber security

1474
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,880
studies guide

1475
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,799
that we developed with many

1476
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:24,960
stakeholders where we

1477
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,559
we are trying to promote with using this

1478
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,000
national

1479
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,520
strategies

1480
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,480
it

1481
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,760
it it

1482
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,040
really

1483
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,839
plays or let's say the top priority of

1484
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:36,720
the

1485
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,200
of the area to be addressed the capacity

1486
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,680
development in the countries where we

1487
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,400
make sure that we can we can allocate no

1488
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,240
not the

1489
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,119
the

1490
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:49,440
let's say the proper resources

1491
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,520
are in the country or regional level to

1492
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,720
make sure

1493
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,559
that uh this

1494
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,720
is something we can um

1495
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,760
achieve

1496
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,319
and also monitor to make sure that we

1497
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,040
have we have built this capacity on the

1498
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,640
needed area on the

1499
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:05,520
region

1500
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,240
so for us um

1501
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,680
the campus development should not be

1502
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,599
part of the these strategies we are

1503
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,920
building our countries and make sure

1504
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,880
that

1505
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,680
we are monitoring them

1506
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,359
accordingly and make sure that the

1507
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:20,960
resources that we are putting in place

1508
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,280
is really trying to build interested

1509
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,119
money in the

1510
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,119
efficient manner

1511
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:28,880
so this is what i was going to uh give

1512
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,839
us a

1513
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,319
idea and i want to also um

1514
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,680
come on what

1515
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,119
uh

1516
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:36,559
but i just said

1517
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,480
uh if this is something really realizing

1518
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,240
that the subway drills is also a way on

1519
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:46,558
building this kind of um let's say

1520
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:49,200
knowledge sharing and also

1521
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,240
the capacity of the countries that only

1522
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,160
that don't have really

1523
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,520
some operational assert to be able to be

1524
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,319
uh

1525
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:01,359
easily going to other people

1526
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:03,280
to look for expertise to deal with some

1527
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,200
instant help in the countries and this

1528
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,640
is something we really realize this is

1529
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,240
something that's improving the continent

1530
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,359
where we have one-to-one also let's say

1531
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:12,720
more

1532
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,119
group communication to be able to uh

1533
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,400
address some incidents or challenges

1534
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,680
that we have

1535
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,880
thank you

1536
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,640
thank you very much serge for sharing

1537
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,960
with us and uh i i strongly agree with

1538
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,760
you uh it's very critical i think all

1539
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,720
this panels so far has uh have addressed

1540
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,640
you know capacity building i'd like to

1541
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,319
end with a quick question to a little

1542
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:34,400
bit about you know you mentioned about

1543
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,799
the us involvement in capacity building

1544
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:39,040
in africa and across the globe actually

1545
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,079
um how important you think this is going

1546
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,040
to be on on your agenda when it comes to

1547
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,599
you know uh you know coming from egypt i

1548
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,440
always think about capacity building in

1549
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,680
terms of a pyramid so you have you know

1550
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,000
the broad uh base of the pyramid where

1551
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,160
you have you know broad knowledge of

1552
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,079
cyber security across different you know

1553
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,480
professionals but when it approached to

1554
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,880
decision makers uh at the top of the

1555
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,440
pyramid the the you know the high level

1556
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,480
uh training of cyber i mean cyber

1557
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,119
security professionals incident handlers

1558
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,559
um what type of engagement do you

1559
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:16,559
anticipate especially when it comes to

1560
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,799
operational uh you know incident

1561
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,160
handling

1562
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,240
this is you know not something that you

1563
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,200
get from attending a class or a session

1564
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,520
but it has to to do with you know uh

1565
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,400
engagement with uh teams providing the

1566
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,079
services

1567
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:34,319
thanks uh yeah that's a that's a

1568
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:37,119
definitely a challenge i would say that

1569
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:39,839
our i kind of think of this in in two in

1570
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,160
two levels we are we are doing a range

1571
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:43,920
of capacity building that i think

1572
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,480
hopefully addresses everything from uh

1573
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,319
you know technical training to new c

1574
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,240
search staff which we are funding the

1575
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,400
software engineering institute to do all

1576
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,520
the way up to um we have had a range of

1577
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,760
conversations that are focused on

1578
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,079
national cyber security strategies and

1579
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:02,319
those um those are those are those are

1580
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:04,000
top level conversations right in an

1581
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
ideal scenario a national cyber security

1582
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,880
strategy is drafted at the mid to senior

1583
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,960
level and then you know approved by

1584
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,720
cabinet um

1585
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,960
i i would also say that i think a couple

1586
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,079
of people have raised a question of

1587
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:18,640
political will um and political will is

1588
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:19,920
something that we

1589
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,400
we struggle with in the united states um

1590
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,880
we struggle with it uh at

1591
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,960
the political level our senior political

1592
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,599
leaders we also struggle um with uh the

1593
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:32,640
private sector having the awareness of

1594
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,720
the need to make cyber security a

1595
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,680
priority and um there's a you know the

1596
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,160
discussion of is it a chief technical

1597
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,400
officer or a chief technology officer

1598
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,160
question or is it a

1599
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,520
chief um

1600
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,440
chief operational question or is it the

1601
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,920
ceo right should it be the head of the

1602
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,359
company paying attention to cyber

1603
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:54,319
security and obviously i um i and others

1604
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:56,720
at sizza um really think that it should

1605
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,839
be a ceo question not just a technology

1606
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:02,240
officer question um and so we're we're

1607
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,000
doing a lot and this is this is more

1608
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,760
domestically but my colleagues are doing

1609
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:06,880
a lot to

1610
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,079
raise the profile of cyber security and

1611
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:12,400
i think frankly we've gotten a lot more

1612
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,920
attention as we've had some very

1613
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,480
prominent cyber security incidents that

1614
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,160
have had

1615
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,039
daily

1616
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,359
effects on people's daily lives such as

1617
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,599
the shutdown besides the ransomware

1618
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:26,240
attack that led the private company

1619
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,319
colonial pipeline to shut down their

1620
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:31,359
pipeline transmitting uh petroleum fuel

1621
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:34,079
uh to a good chunk of the east coast so

1622
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:35,680
i'm sure if you may have been impacted

1623
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,839
by that personally um

1624
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:39,520
i live a little bit north so i didn't

1625
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,760
have to put gasoline in in plastic bags

1626
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,520
which no one should ever do but people

1627
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,039
did it because they were worried about

1628
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:47,760
getting access to gasoline um again

1629
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,839
please don't ever put gasoline in in

1630
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:52,720
plastic bags that's a very bad idea um

1631
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,920
but uh it does it does illustrate how

1632
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,920
you know the one way to get political

1633
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,920
will is to have a really bad incident

1634
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,240
and our our hope is that the technical

1635
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,559
assistance we can provide can help raise

1636
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:07,119
the awareness of cyber security so that

1637
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:09,599
you can learn from our mistakes um and

1638
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:11,440
and get that senior level political will

1639
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,799
and get those private companies to

1640
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:14,960
understand the need to to put this high

1641
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,000
on the agenda um just in terms of what

1642
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
our our work has done we've you know

1643
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,119
we've done a range of things um i think

1644
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:24,640
one thing that i would draw your

1645
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:27,839
attention to is in 2019 before travel

1646
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:30,880
stopped we convened a small group of um

1647
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,880
some t-shirts on the continent along

1648
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,960
with the african union commission

1649
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,680
to talk about uh exchange between sea

1650
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,440
certs on the continent an exchange of

1651
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,920
information so that if a hack works in

1652
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,200
one country

1653
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,880
you know incident handlers in in that

1654
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,000
country can share with their their

1655
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,960
neighbors and and appropriate steps can

1656
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,520
you know be taken so that uh

1657
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,799
government networks can defend

1658
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:56,799
themselves going back to the point about

1659
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,480
confidence building measures i think

1660
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,119
those kinds of things are opportunities

1661
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:03,760
to build relationships that can then be

1662
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,240
relevant um in in

1663
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,480
when there is an incident but i would

1664
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,720
also say that i think formal confidence

1665
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,599
building measures at the regional level

1666
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:16,240
or between individual governments or

1667
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,720
within regional economic communities

1668
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,760
can be a really beneficial way to

1669
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,599
not simply rely on those individual

1670
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,839
relationships built at conferences like

1671
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:28,160
this one but also to

1672
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,039
um help raise political will and raise

1673
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:33,680
awareness of the need for this so you

1674
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,200
know a formal confidence building

1675
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,000
measure negotiated one gun one country

1676
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,880
to the other can be an opportunity for

1677
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,559
uh the c for a technical community or a

1678
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:46,640
national ministry of communications for

1679
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:50,160
example to get um buy-in from the

1680
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,880
president or from the minister to

1681
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,480
explain you know this is why we're

1682
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,480
building this formal confidence building

1683
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,480
measure and we think out of this we will

1684
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,400
be able to address incidents as they

1685
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,039
occur or if they were to occur so wrap

1686
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:04,960
it all back up

1687
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,319

let me start with

1705
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,799

enough to be on a another first event

1718
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:28,319
before and i i i really appreciate

1719
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:31,200
uh the planning that goes into these

1720
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,760
um i'd like to just spend a cup a few

1721
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,799
minutes uh first of all introducing uh

1722
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:39,119
cyber for cyber resilience for

1723
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:42,480
development which is an eu project uh

1724
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,799
for which i am a regional coordinator

1725
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:47,039
focused on africa

1726
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:49,920
um and speak a little bit about what we

1727
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,880
do and then um i'd also like to come

1728
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,280
back to a few of the comments um that

1729
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,880
have been made by

1730
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,640
some of the earlier panelists which i

1731
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,599
thought were very uh insightful and very

1732
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:05,200
relevant um i'm going to uh make take

1733
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,680
that faithful step of trying to share my

1734
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:08,720
screen

1735
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:13,200
um and uh let me do that very quickly

1736
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:17,359
um so just as introduction um cyber

1737
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:19,119
resilience for development is an

1738
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,520
eu-funded project

1739
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,160
that has been in operation for several

1740
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,319
years now

1741
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:29,359
with the goal of engaging with

1742
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:32,880
um organizations countries regional

1743
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,079
entities

1744
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:37,520
um around building cyber resilience and

1745
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,200
building cyber resilience for

1746
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,640
development

1747
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,359
uh and i stress the word development and

1748
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:46,480
i go back to elizabeth's comments um

1749
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,640
just a little bit there earlier she used

1750
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,559
the point of uh

1751
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:53,039
shed prosperity the shed prosperity that

1752
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:56,160
we can all gain uh from the benefits

1753
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,119
that

1754
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:59,760
cyberspace can provide us

1755
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,640
and

1756
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,680
our agenda and our our mission

1757
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,880
is to

1758
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,920
pres

1759
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,799
promote the resilience that's needed

1760
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:11,839
so that people um across the world can

1761
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:16,238
benefit from um from what cyber uh has

1762
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:17,600
to offer

1763
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,319
and um you know we we feel it's very

1764
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:21,920
important that we don't lose sight of

1765
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,080
that in the sense that

1766
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,399
i i think many of us spend our days

1767
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:29,359
worrying and addressing and uh watching

1768
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:32,080
threats and risks that are emerging but

1769
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:35,839
we also have to recognize that uh

1770
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:38,880
with um with the reach of cyberspace

1771
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,640
today the benefits that it delivers are

1772
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,640
not not a nice to have they are a

1773
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:45,839
must-have

1774
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:49,679
and they they really do act um to be

1775
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:51,920
able to promote that development and

1776
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,238
that shared perspective prosperity

1777
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:55,920
across the globe

1778
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:56,880
um

1779
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,359
very quickly our project as i say eu

1780
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:01,839
funded we have three primary

1781
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:03,920
implementation partners

1782
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,560
um which are the republic of estonia and

1783
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,198
the information systems authority

1784
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:12,000
um the british foreign commonwealth and

1785
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,479
development office and the ministry of

1786
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:16,960
foreign affairs from the netherlands and

1787
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,520
together these influen implementation

1788
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,399
partners

1789
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:23,839
support our efforts but um we very much

1790
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,600
rely upon

1791
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,238
expertise from across europe to be able

1792
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:29,600
to

1793
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,158
deliver our various initiatives and

1794
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:34,319
interventions

1795
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:36,880
wherever we can find the right expertise

1796
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,198
and the right capabilities

1797
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:41,439
to support our efforts

1798
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:45,279
i'm briefly looking at what is it we do

1799
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:46,238
and

1800
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:48,479
how do we seek to engage

1801
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:49,359
um

1802
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:51,839
we we work with partner countries really

1803
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:54,560
in three primary areas

1804
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,920
the first of which is the obvious um

1805
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,679
one around incident response and um

1806
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:03,520
cyber security and

1807
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:04,840
response

1808
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:09,280
capabilities uh building up those um

1809
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,640
both for

1810
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,840
um

1811
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,320
environments where there may not be a

1812
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,440
assert or a sea cert in place today but

1813
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:20,480
also very much working with

1814
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:23,280
those sea certs that are underway but

1815
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:26,080
are um seeking to further mature their

1816
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:30,000
capabilities uh further grow

1817
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,480
both their capacity but also

1818
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:38,640
their integration into the international

1819
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,920
cyber security community

1820
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,760
a secondary focus is lies in the one

1821
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,960
that again elizabeth described above in

1822
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,760
the sense of the national strategies

1823
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,840
and um here

1824
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,199
we we don't seek to

1825
01:10:57,199 --> 01:11:01,679
in any way you know dictate or advise

1826
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:04,560
strongly what a national strategy

1827
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,360
uh must contain but rather

1828
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:10,320
um look more at the practical side of

1829
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,640
implementing a strategy

1830
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,679
um

1831
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:16,000
we all know that um

1832
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,320
it takes an awful lot of effort it takes

1833
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,120
an awful lot of collaboration

1834
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,560
and cooperation to see a strategy and

1835
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,360
the national cyber security strategy

1836
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,400
adopted and reached that important phase

1837
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,440
of

1838
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,920
cabinet approval

1839
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,960
but often um

1840
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,080
we we then worry about what next how do

1841
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,120
we get this strategy implemented how do

1842
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:46,239
we actually um

1843
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:48,880
deliver on that strategy and reach the

1844
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,560
goals that uh

1845
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:54,880
that the strategy sets out so we seek to

1846
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,520
uh engage with partners very much on the

1847
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,480
practical aspects of implementing

1848
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,920
strategies

1849
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,520
i i i i'll step back slightly and say

1850
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,840
well while not um uh you know by by not

1851
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,679
necessarily

1852
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:13,920
suggesting um

1853
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,120
major content of the national strategies

1854
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:20,960
one thing i think we do recommend is to

1855
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,520
try and try and keep it as

1856
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:28,000
um uh as balanced and as manageable as

1857
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,080
possible because um

1858
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,679
uh often

1859
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:33,520
you know in other fields we've seen

1860
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,760
wonderful strategies develop

1861
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:36,400
that

1862
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,760
are very difficult to implement

1863
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,320
because they are so far-reaching and so

1864
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:45,920
broad so taking things in

1865
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:46,640
in

1866
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,600
logical and prioritized steps uh

1867
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,480
sometimes is the most manageable way

1868
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,600
to see these strategies progress

1869
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,880
um a third area of focus is

1870
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,800
uh one which

1871
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,000
you know the these sessions um are very

1872
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,320
much a part of and that is building up

1873
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,080
the um

1874
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,840
communication and cooperation of

1875
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:15,600
cyber professionals uh from across the

1876
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,360
continent and with that uh

1877
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,320
getting

1878
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,320
getting the lines of communication and

1879
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,679
cooperation open across the globe

1880
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:26,800
um

1881
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,760
there was uh an interesting comment many

1882
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,560
made just earlier by engineer badar from

1883
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,960
from oman where he spoke about the

1884
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,000
importance of one-on-one connections

1885
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,719
um and this is something that we strive

1886
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:43,400
to support which is building those

1887
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:46,480
relationships between

1888
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:49,199
those individuals and those

1889
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:50,480
those

1890
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:53,360
experts or technicians

1891
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:56,800
that sit and have to deal with um

1892
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,600
risks and threats on a daily basis

1893
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,520
getting them connected with their

1894
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,840
counterparts um in other nations or

1895
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:09,040
within other certs within their country

1896
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,800
to be able to build

1897
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,600
those levels of trust where information

1898
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,199
can be shared

1899
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:19,199
um we we really do believe in that word

1900
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:23,120
trust that uh um you know cooperation

1901
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:26,080
comes from having trust across

1902
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,640
sea certs and um

1903
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,600
uh

1904
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,400
cyber security incident response

1905
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,640
teams as a whole

1906
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,080
and um the only way to build trust is is

1907
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:41,679
through building relationships

1908
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:45,760
um the uh the pandemic in the past uh a

1909
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,840
couple of years now we've faced has

1910
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:51,040
really restricted our ability to uh

1911
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,800
uh facilitate

1912
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,600
face-to-face meeting but i think

1913
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:59,280
we we feel strongly that

1914
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,679
as we progress and hopefully find our

1915
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:04,159
way uh back to

1916
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:07,520
our new normal our new normal will also

1917
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:11,840
include um us being able to have

1918
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,880
just these types of events face to face

1919
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,280
where individuals can

1920
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:20,560
build relationships can meet people

1921
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,880
and can

1922
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,000
with that go back and be able to reach

1923
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,880
out in the future knowing who it is and

1924
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,840
and uh who it is they're engaging with

1925
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,280
and have that level of trust um as they

1926
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,800
move forward

1927
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,920
um so i think i've i've already used up

1928
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,640
all my time just uh

1929
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,480
through an introduction

1930
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:47,520
um but uh i think uh i have a few points

1931
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,000
that i think we'll we'll we'll get to uh

1932
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,800
when we get to questions so uh

1933
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,120
sheriff i'll i'll hand it back to you

1934
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:58,000
and then look forward to uh fielding

1935
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,400
some questions thank you

1936
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,159
thanks for sharing nick i really

1937
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:04,719
appreciate all your points uh

1938
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:06,880
building trust is key we'll get back to

1939
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,520
that later i'd like to move to our next

1940
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,520

so i'm going to also try to share my

1957
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,560
screen um but i will keep it brief um in

1958
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:00,280
the interests of time

1959
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,960
so hopefully everybody can um see my

1960
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,199
first slide there so just by way of an

1961
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:21,520
introduction what i want to talk about

1962
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,360
um today is

1963
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:26,080
uh an initiative known as the african

1964
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,679
commonwealth national cyber risk

1965
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,280
assessment initiative

1966
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:32,000
this is a program that is sponsored by

1967
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,920
the uk's foreign commonwealth and

1968
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:36,239
development office and it's delivered by

1969
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:37,679
the home office

1970
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:40,640
international cyber team

1971
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,840
so the focus of this project is to

1972
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,440
really help countries to gain an

1973
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,480
understanding of cybersecurity risk at

1974
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,239
the national level particularly to

1975
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:51,920
critical national infrastructure and

1976
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,719
essential digital services and

1977
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:56,800
more importantly to be able to use that

1978
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,440
information to help drive cyber security

1979
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:02,400
capacity building and ultimately to help

1980
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,600
to mitigate those national risks

1981
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,159
so over the last

1982
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:10,960
three years we've been working with the

1983
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,040
african commonwealth countries

1984
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,640
we've been working with countries on an

1985
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,840
individual basis um to help run those

1986
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,760
national cyber risk assessment projects

1987
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,400
and gain that understanding and also

1988
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,760
we've worked with the african

1989
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,679
commonwealth as a community via our

1990
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:30,159
um annual uh capacity building

1991
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:31,920
conference where we bring together

1992
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,080
representatives from uh the african

1993
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,560
commonwealth and we focus on capacity

1994
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,800
building under a number of headings um

1995
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,560
you know clearly with our focus on

1996
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:43,360
national risk assessment and cni uh we

1997
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:45,520
focus on cni protection

1998
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,320
but we also focus on strategy and policy

1999
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,159
particularly looking at how assessments

2000
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,960
like a national risk assessment but also

2001
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,040
a maturity assessment like oxford

2002
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,719
university's capacity maturity model

2003
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:59,440
assessment how those insights can be

2004
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,679
brought together to help shape strategy

2005
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:03,840
and policy

2006
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,920
as part of our work across the

2007
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,920
commonwealth we've also

2008
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:10,400
gathered a view of where capacity gaps

2009
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,920
are most acute and some of the

2010
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,400
requirements and that's led us to focus

2011
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,880
in a number of areas one is about skills

2012
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,560
and we've already heard about that so

2013
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,719
you know raising the skill levels and

2014
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:22,320
particularly looking at diversity and

2015
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:25,040
inclusion as a key plank of you know

2016
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,159
improving

2017
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:28,000
the availability of skills within any

2018
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,280
country

2019
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,360
looking at cyber attack exercises which

2020
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:34,960
i know have already come up so running

2021
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,440
tabletop virtual cyber attack

2022
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,840
simulations and how important they are

2023
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,080
and how that's a capability that every

2024
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,320
country can benefit from

2025
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,440
and we've looked at countering

2026
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,199
cybercrime because that emerges as a

2027
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,520
major concern for every country and we

2028
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,679
look at threat intelligence as a key

2029
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:54,400
tool um to help us with that insight

2030
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,239
so

2031
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:58,719
because our focus is on national cyber

2032
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,640
risk assessment i thought i'd just spend

2033
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,800
a few minutes giving a bit of context to

2034
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:05,360
what we mean when we talk about national

2035
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,360
cyber risk assessment so we're really

2036
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,920
talking about a strategic national level

2037
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,080
assessment and it fitting in with an

2038
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,000
overall top-down approach that might

2039
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,480
start with a national view of overall

2040
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:17,280
risk

2041
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,760
then factor out the cyber element of

2042
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,000
that risk and then continue in a

2043
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,920
top-down approach that helps develop an

2044
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,000
understanding of that cyber risk in the

2045
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,960
context of national risk and then use

2046
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,880
that to help feed the capacity building

2047
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,360
actions that will follow on from that so

2048
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:36,320
we promote a very top-down approach um

2049
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,159
working from a national picture and a

2050
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:41,760
national strategy policy on on down

2051
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,960
in terms of why we've got this focus on

2052
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,440
risk assessment it's because we believe

2053
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,280
it's a critical part of the jigsaw

2054
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,280
puzzle when it comes to understanding

2055
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,520
how to improve cyber security and

2056
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,400
focusing on cni and essential digital

2057
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,520
services is a core part of

2058
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,880
pretty much every country's national

2059
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,880
cyber security strategy

2060
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,040
so understanding risk in terms of impact

2061
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,639
and likelihood understanding

2062
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:08,719
dependencies

2063
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:11,520
which is a theme i might come back to um

2064
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,360
and looking at what constitutes the

2065
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,600
likelihood of a cyber attack so looking

2066
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,320
at threat vectors looking at

2067
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,760
vulnerabilities

2068
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,760
and then the whole point of the exercise

2069
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,679
of conducting nsra is to combine all

2070
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:26,239
those insights into a an

2071
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:27,840
analysis and a report and

2072
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,920
recommendations that can drive capacity

2073
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,159
building so um i won't dwell on this one

2074
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:33,440
we've already touched on colonial

2075
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,760
pipeline cyber security attacks to the

2076
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,440
critical national infrastructure are

2077
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,679
escalating and becoming more and more of

2078
01:21:39,679 --> 01:21:41,679
a concern to all of us it wasn't always

2079
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:44,000
the case but now it's very much an area

2080
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,719
of of key concern for all of us um so

2081
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:47,920
protecting our critical national

2082
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,600
infrastructure is important

2083
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:50,719
uh

2084
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:52,320
pretty much every piece of modern

2085
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,679
critical national infrastructure is

2086
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:55,600
underpinned by an information system

2087
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,960
hence cyber is important

2088
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,560
sectors like communications and

2089
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,360
utilities cut across every other sector

2090
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,760
so dependencies are really important and

2091
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,520
unless we understand what are the

2092
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,560
systems that make up our cni then we'll

2093
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,080
find it very hard to defend those

2094
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,000
systems and add resilience to those

2095
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,560
systems um so we recommend a cyclical

2096
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:17,520
approach

2097
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,159
measuring the risk picture um through a

2098
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:21,199
survey

2099
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:23,120
analyzing the risk picture

2100
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,600
using that to prioritize where to focus

2101
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,679
scarce investment effort and then the

2102
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:29,679
the fourth and most important stage is

2103
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:31,360
to feed that information into action

2104
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,760
plans programs and projects and that's

2105
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,760
basically the essence of our national

2106
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,480
cyber risk assessment guidance

2107
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,560
we look at threats and threats need to

2108
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,719
be

2109
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:45,199
tracked all the time there are trends

2110
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:46,560
we're seeing a lot more supply chain

2111
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,480
attacks so we need to constantly track

2112
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,760
those attacks

2113
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,520
understanding the capacity building

2114
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,520
capabilities that are going to make most

2115
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:56,000
difference is important so mapping that

2116
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,719
risk picture onto where we can invest so

2117
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:00,800
things like risk management within cni

2118
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,159
organizations

2119
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:04,480
training asset management incident

2120
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:05,840
management these are all important

2121
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:08,000
capacity building headings that you can

2122
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,080
map the insights of a risk assessment

2123
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,760
into

2124
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:14,400
risk itself we use the standard model um

2125
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,880
for risk and we gather information on

2126
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:19,440
impacts at that lowest level we provide

2127
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,760
tools and calculate the various aspects

2128
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:22,800
of risk

2129
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,719
this allows us to reduce the overall

2130
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:26,800
risk by mitigating impacts and reducing

2131
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,880
likelihood and taking actions at that

2132
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,400
lowest level there

2133
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,239
so just to give an idea of what does an

2134
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:34,400
analysis look like this is your standard

2135
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,560
impact and likelihood grid the numbers

2136
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:39,120
in there are illustrative of the number

2137
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,679
of systems across all sectors that we

2138
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:43,920
find at that level of risk so this

2139
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,280
allows the immediate sort of

2140
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,080
categorization and the red highlighted

2141
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,320
systems there you know it shows that in

2142
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,639
this illustrative example there are four

2143
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:55,040
systems at a likelihood of five and an

2144
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,199
impact of five so these are critical

2145
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:59,679
systems that really need urgent action

2146
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:02,080
to address so that's typical of the

2147
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,760
insights that come from a national cyber

2148
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,920
risk assessment obviously you can drill

2149
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,719
down by sector and and conduct various

2150
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:10,400
and analytical views

2151
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:11,199
um

2152
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:13,360
just a few sort of highlighted best

2153
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:14,719
practices

2154
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:16,800
we've found that taking a very broad

2155
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,400
view of impact is important so

2156
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:19,760
considering things like national

2157
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,280
reputation

2158
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:22,960
we aggregate

2159
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,040
components of systems up into coarse

2160
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,800
grain systems that deliver essential

2161
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,760
services that's how we break down

2162
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:33,280
cni into a manageable set of systems

2163
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,800
we believe it's really important to

2164
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,880
understand national and international

2165
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,880
dependencies because our supply chains

2166
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,199
are so much more interconnected now and

2167
01:24:41,199 --> 01:24:43,679
becoming even more interconnected

2168
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:45,760
and the final slide there is just a

2169
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:47,600
summary of what we consider the best

2170
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,840
practice very happy to

2171
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,760
make these slides available

2172
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,840
but in the interest of time i think i

2173
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,199
will stop there

2174
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:58,480
thank you very much dr sharif

2175
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,960
thank you jeremy you really

2176
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,639
shared with us a very lively

2177
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,639
presentation i really appreciate this

2178
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:07,120
you touched upon you know quite a few

2179
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,480
important points

2180
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,480
when it comes to critical national

2181
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,639
infrastructure recognizing them

2182
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:14,239
coordinating efforts the

2183
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:16,159
interdependencies you touched upon

2184
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:18,000
interdependencies this is really

2185
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,120
critical

2186
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,560
you know failure and one of the

2187
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:23,199
infrastructure can result in just not

2188
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:25,440
you know affecting a specific sector it

2189
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,760
can have a ripple effect so that's a

2190
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,000
very important aspect of looking at

2191
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,320
things having assessment at different

2192
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:36,159
levels is also important

2193
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:38,719
you touched upon supply chain attacks

2194
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:40,960
and advanced persistent threat without

2195
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,000
even

2196
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,880
using the you know the the apt acronym

2197
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,840
but you know this is a pattern of cyber

2198
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:50,000
attacks that we are seeing uh i mean

2199
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,560
recently i've started seeing more of and

2200
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,199
unfortunately we anticipate more of it

2201
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:57,920

2238
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,159
international initiatives that we had to

2239
01:27:34,159 --> 01:27:36,400
take in place in with that we have to

2240
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,880
take in togo to build effective you know

2241
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,120
operational framework for for our cyber

2242
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,920
security program you know how to build

2243
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:47,280
uh effective uh cert and suck you know

2244
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:49,520
uh you know how to to build effective

2245
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,679
incident response capabilities and

2246
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:54,480
protect uh efficiency efficiently you

2247
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,040
know our critical infrastructure so uh

2248
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,440
in togo we decided to do it via

2249
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,800
ppp so public partner public private

2250
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,800
part partnership and i'm happy that the

2251

2253
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,239
initiatives so

2265
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:34,320
challenges of cyber security that we had

2266
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:37,440
to face to explain why we had to put in

2267
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,520
place a public private partnership and

2268

so um

2279
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:04,480
the challenges of cyber security that we

2280
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,320
had to face in togo you know the the

2281
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,840
togolese republic has a

2282
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:11,679
strong development plan based on the

2283
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:14,719
digital as a matter of fact 70

2284
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:17,440
of our uh five-year plan of development

2285
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:20,880
70 of the projects are really rely on it

2286
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:25,280
on a digital plat platform yeah so uh

2287
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:28,080
fortunately for for us that gave us the

2288
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,120
the

2289
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,360
to discuss the importance that gave us

2290
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,600
the chance to discuss the importance the

2291
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,080
importance of cyber security into that

2292
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,560
that that pro program so

2293
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,440
uh

2294
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,159
we had an urgent need to protect you

2295
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:44,880
know our critical infrastructures uh our

2296
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,920
public institutions and and uh and and

2297
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:50,159
and the citizens right because all these

2298
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:50,960
uh

2299
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,120
public initiatives are impacting the

2300
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:56,480
citizens directly right so we had the

2301
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,719
urgency to uh protect them

2302
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:03,040
we also had the financial

2303
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:06,320
issue right cyber security is uh is is

2304
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:09,280
is quite an expensive pro program so we

2305
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,400
had to

2306
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,560
find solutions to you know on how to

2307
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,960
finance it and how to finance it

2308
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:17,040
on a sustainable way

2309
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,440
not only relying on on

2310
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,760
public funds on our

2311
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:23,840
public you know state fine financing so

2312
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:26,480
we had to find a solution on how to

2313
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:29,199
finance our cyber security program

2314
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:32,000
uh a lot of the panelists that talked to

2315
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,520
today obviously they talked about

2316
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,280
building capacity you know in terms of

2317
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:37,440
technologies human resources and so on

2318
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:41,600
so uh in in in togo uh as many of the

2319
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,760
african countries and and as many of the

2320
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,600
countries in the world you know we are

2321
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,520
limited in terms of resources right in

2322
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,400
terms of human resources so that's one

2323
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,080
of the challenges that we had to face as

2324
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,440
well

2325
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:55,760
and on the other hand you know the the

2326
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,920
the attack surface is increasing right

2327
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,159
and we uh dr sheriff just talked about

2328
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:02,080
the apts right and

2329
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:04,400
and the the threats the attacks that are

2330
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,960
more and more sophisticated right so we

2331
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:08,480
we

2332
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,480
and when when when you compare this to

2333
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:13,600
the uh urgency of protection you know

2334
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:16,480
the the the actors the the threat actors

2335
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,320
they don't wait for you to be ready

2336
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,880
right they they they hack you right now

2337
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,440
straight straight away so we had to do

2338
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:26,000
well and we had to do quick and the last

2339
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,960
point that i want to discuss is as

2340
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,960
a challenge that we had to face was the

2341
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,159
lack of trust you know in in our country

2342
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:36,000
uh

2343
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,560
the public institutions do not get the

2344
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,280
trust from the private sector from the

2345
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:43,360
citizens from the partners and so on

2346
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:46,159
right so we had to build trust and so

2347
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:49,840
that the the the national cert had the

2348
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:53,760
trust of all these entities

2349
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:57,679
and at the same time we wanted to be you

2350
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:00,159
know not only build a cert but build one

2351
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:02,080
of the best cert in the region you know

2352
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:03,920
we we our

2353
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:07,280
the vision of the government uh was to

2354
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:09,600
not not only do it but do it well and do

2355
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,239
it the best way as we could so we had

2356
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:14,639
the political will we had the leadership

2357
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:15,920
from the double

2358
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,080
republic from the head of states to all

2359
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:19,840
the ministers involved into that into

2360
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,880
that project so digital economy security

2361
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,400
defense and so on

2362
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,480
they were all really really involved

2363
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,400
into the project so we had the political

2364
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,239
win uh

2365
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:32,719
we created a national agency for cyber

2366
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:35,120
security right it was important on our

2367
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,280
ecosystem

2368
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:39,920
but then we had that

2369
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,120
decree

2370
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,440
designating our operators of essential

2371
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,760
services so the critical infrastructures

2372
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:48,239
and they had the obligation to protect

2373
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:50,719
themselves against cyber attacks right

2374
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:51,679
so

2375
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:54,719
when we seen this we decided to create a

2376
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:57,600
company you know private company uh

2377
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:00,080
that was part of the shares were held by

2378
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:03,040
the state and this company we gave

2379
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,760
this company the ability to operate the

2380
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:11,120
national cert right so then this company

2381
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,280
not only will operate the national sect

2382
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:15,520
but we want this company to

2383
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:18,960
behave as a private entity you know

2384
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,080
because

2385
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:22,560
in our ecosystem the private sector has

2386
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,840
this uh capability to deliver better

2387
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,520
services you know better quality of

2388
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:30,320
services than the public sector so we

2389
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:32,400
wanted really this company to have a

2390
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:35,120
private mindset and not only be a public

2391
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:39,600
institution so we decided to add to this

2392
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,239
to the role of this company the ability

2393
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:45,040
to operate the national suck and this

2394
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,880
service would be provided to the

2395
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:50,000
critical infrastructures

2396
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,120
so now we ended up having a company that

2397
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:55,440
will operate the cert the national cert

2398
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:57,840
and the national stock and

2399
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,440
this this

2400
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:02,000
model gave us you know uh uh

2401
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,040
synergies we created since synergies uh

2402
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:06,800
in terms of resources in terms of

2403
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:09,440
finance uh because actually we use the

2404
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:11,520
same resources for the celt and the

2405
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:12,880
national sock

2406
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,040
where the goal is to pro

2407
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:19,120
protect the critical infrastructures

2408
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:20,639
now uh

2409
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:22,560
for the financing issue

2410
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,320
uh we decided that the

2411
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:27,760
services so the security for the uh

2412
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,760
for the

2413
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:33,600
critical infrastructures would be uh

2414
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,239
paid by by by actually the private

2415
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:37,840
sector right this critical

2416
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,120
infrastructure they would have to pay

2417
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:41,440
for the services for uh

2418
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:42,719
protection

2419
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:44,719
and then we will use this money that

2420
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:47,679
this company is is having to operate the

2421
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:50,320
self you know so we found we we actually

2422
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,480
found a way to finance our cyber

2423
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:56,239
security uh by the private sector

2424
01:34:56,239 --> 01:34:58,480
and then we have uh

2425
01:34:58,480 --> 01:34:59,280
we

2426
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:02,320
we decided to bring in a private uh

2427
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:05,280
partner which is uh aseco data systems a

2428
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:07,679
polish company to help us build this

2429
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:11,520
company uh because then we would you

2430
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,600
know use the track records we would use

2431
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,920
their their their processes we will use

2432
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:18,239
their quality of service to provide the

2433
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:20,639
best in class quality of service to uh

2434
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:23,360
the the private sector and this actually

2435
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:26,000
helped us as well to

2436
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,840
you know have a knowledge transfer and

2437
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:32,080
transfer of technologies and all that

2438
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,080
done in the best way post possible

2439
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:36,719
because then our interests were aligned

2440
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:39,280
right it's not only a provider

2441
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:41,679
delivering services or trainings to

2442
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:44,719
another another to its client but now we

2443
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:47,199
created that company together so the

2444
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:49,119
transfer of knowledge and the transfer

2445
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:52,080
of technologies are done from partner to

2446
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,320
partner you know

2447
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,400
because we built this company together

2448
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,000
so

2449
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,920
let me present you the structure of the

2450
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:03,600
project uh really quickly so you have uh

2451
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,400
togolese republic and aseco

2452
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,960
so togolese republic holds 68 of the

2453
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:12,159
shares of that company and aseco has 32

2454
01:36:12,159 --> 01:36:13,520
percent of the shares it's really

2455
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:16,080
important because this is how we control

2456
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:18,719
our sovereignty 68

2457
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:21,119
of the shares is what is required in

2458
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:22,560
togo

2459
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:24,400
to have the control of the company so we

2460
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,480
can take any decision we want without

2461
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,719
the private partner right so we just we

2462
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:32,239
created cga together we have the

2463
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:34,880
national agency of cyber security and

2464
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,520
tabula's republic is issuing you know

2465
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:41,199
laws and decrees and and and all you

2466
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:42,400
know the

2467
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:46,080
regulatory frame framework

2468
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:49,600
the ansi is delegating some services you

2469
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:52,560
know all the technical services to cyber

2470
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:55,040
defense africa now all the technical and

2471
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,679
operational activities are done by cyber

2472
01:36:57,679 --> 01:37:00,159
defense africa this company created by

2473
01:37:00,159 --> 01:37:02,560
both douglas republic and aseco data

2474
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:05,119
systems a second data system

2475
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:06,719
is helping cyber defense africa and

2476
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:08,880
togolese republic actually to build you

2477
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:11,760
know capacity

2478
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,679
we actually had uh uh

2479
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:18,000
you know support from from from a bank

2480
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,560
and this was important because by doing

2481
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:23,280
so we do not impact on the state finance

2482
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:26,239
we do we we do not rely on the state you

2483
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:28,639
know money to actually develop our cyber

2484
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:30,880
security program so now we have a

2485
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,440
sustainable model right and we are able

2486
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:37,199
to deliver the self-services non-pro

2487
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:39,199
profit obviously free for all the

2488
01:37:39,199 --> 01:37:42,320
citizens and everybody that needs to you

2489
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:43,440
know uh

2490
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,440
that need help to respond to its

2491
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:48,400
incidents we are here to help and we

2492
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,960
develop services for you know a circ

2493
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:53,600
client as well and and then that's where

2494
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:56,080
we get getting paid and that's where we

2495
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:58,320
get the money to you know pay the the

2496
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:00,000
bank so this is the model that we have

2497
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,800
structured in togo to uh you know

2498
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,920
develop our cyber security

2499
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,840
program so

2500
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:10,080
quickly i will not waste time on on this

2501
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:12,400
slide i talked about it cyber defense

2502
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,880
africa is a ppp between togo and aseco

2503
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:18,159
data systems and i will go uh on my

2504
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:21,199
final slide uh presenting the first

2505
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:23,920
results right that we've uh experienced

2506
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:26,560
so far so uh our journey of cyber

2507
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,840
security started in december

2508
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:30,560
28

2509
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:33,360
where uh we released the law on cyber

2510
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,520
security and fight against cyber cyber

2511
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:40,159
crime so basically to 2018 and 2019

2512
01:38:40,159 --> 01:38:42,400
was the regulatory framework you know

2513
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,639
all the laws all the decrees that were

2514
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:47,760
necessary to put in place uh the cyber

2515
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,400
structure in the in the country so end

2516
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:54,320
of 2019 we created cyber defense africa

2517
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,400
and the the the real you know the

2518
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:59,440
technical story started really in 2020

2519
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,840
when we when we recruited the whole team

2520
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:04,639
the technical team of cga and we started

2521
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:07,600
the journey you know that 2020 was also

2522
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:11,119
a big event in the world named kovid19

2523
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:13,520
um but this

2524
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:15,840
did not you know

2525
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:19,639
impacted us as uh as such because
