all the participants here looking um

74
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,760
at the the list in the chat of of all

75
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,519
the countries present

76
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,080
for a change i feel in the minority i'm

77
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,480
coming from switzerland and usually at

78
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,560
these type of events it's always pale

79
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,040
males it's always kind of

80
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,000
white men from u.s or north america and

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,840
i'm really happy to see this is not the

82
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,599
case today because this is really what

83
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,400
improving security together means it's

84
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,519
uh and we had earlier this year the

85
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,760
first conversation was

86
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,720
africa about how we should go on about

87
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,959
this event one of the things we brought

88
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,879
up is that we felt

89
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,560
there should be more contributions from

90
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,480
africa because

91
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,239
the perception the global perception is

92
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,080
always there's there's all these really

93
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,319
super smart people in kind of the

94
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,480
so-called developed nations and then

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,879
there's the rest but last year's event

96
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,480
has shown to me that this is not the

97
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,799
case and today's program the next the

98
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,959
program of the next two days proves that

99
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,879
this is not the case there's great

100
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,439
talent and i'm really happy to see that

101
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,840
that this talent this potential is not

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,319
only potential it's actually reality and

103
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,159
i think no one has to argue that the

104
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,799
internet is going to be a game changer

105
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,519
also in the african arab region but it's

106
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,600
actually good to see that these regions

107
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,680
are taking things into their own hand

108
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,680
and come up with your own versions and

109
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,919
their own self-confidence

110
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,080
so in that sense i'm really looking

111
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,400
forward to two days of actually learning

112
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,960
from your experience in your unique

113
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,800
individual cultural environments and

114
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,639
context which

115
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,960
sometimes is difficult for us for me to

116
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,080
understand

117
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,360
and not in a bad way but in a way that i

118
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,680
feel i can learn a lot from you so

119
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,550
welcome and thank you very much

120
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,679

workshop

260
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,000
the digital is a great opportunity to

261
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
improve the life of citizens with

262
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,240
connected administration e-banking

263
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,480
e-services due to the innovation in

264
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,040
artificial intelligence iot blockchain

265
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,079
5g

266
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,920
big data and all the issues you know

267
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,880
about

268
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,279
but this is making personal data and

269
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,800
even state data

270
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,440
more exposed to better connected hackers

271
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,519
and criminals

272
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,600
the digital inclusion

273
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,760
which is a noble noble goal is also

274
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,519
expanding the threat

275
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,360
on our data and information networks

276
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,000
we misconfigured or miscoded online

277
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,320
service can be fatal and we've seen

278
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,880
recent cases while creating e-wallets in

279
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,760
tunisia we created wallets to distribute

280
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,279
the the aid for covet 19 the needy

281
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,160
people and we created that online

282
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,200
service and the database was exposed

283
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,040
including some personal data phone

284
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,560
numbers id numbers and so on and

285
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,440
unfortunately hackers did discover the

286
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,519
flow and the mistake and they were able

287
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,720
to get part of the data and the database

288
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,680
and was a little bit created little

289
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,240
mistrust in the system

290
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,560
fortunately we discovered the issue

291
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,839
quickly with nc with our cert and we got

292
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,399
help from them on time unfortunately we

293
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,480
were able to save the service

294
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,040
but that can can touch on the trust that

295
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,519
can people can have in in online

296
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,000
services

297
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,880
so here comes the need for a hierarchy

298
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,000
of certs at the international level as

299
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,480
we have first and africa cert and so on

300
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,120
the national level the way we have is uh

301
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,320
nc and cert as well as sector-based

302
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,160
levels for better coordination and

303
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,279
adoption for this we have a banking cert

304
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,800
we have telecommunication search we have

305
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,200
computer center search and so on all of

306
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,279
that connected in the network

307
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,560
configured with with the national cert

308
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,200
so in tunisia we have six certs three of

309
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,600
them are first members and we we

310
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,680
recently launched the network of certs

311
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,720
and socks

312
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
for better coordination within

313
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,639
themselves and with africa third and

314
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,320
first

315
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,560
the final word for me today is uh you're

316
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,639
building the trust in digital services

317
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,880
keep up the good work and good luck in

318
