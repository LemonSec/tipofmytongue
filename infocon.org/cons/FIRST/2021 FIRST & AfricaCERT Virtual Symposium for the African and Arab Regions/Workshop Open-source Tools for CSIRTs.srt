[Music]

2
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,160
talent is how to generate your medical

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,119
list

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,680
this is made in this engineering

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,519
model

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,519
which will show you a little bit

7
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,080
various

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,439
security tools firewall needs

9
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,640
and also some little monitoring tools to

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,000
have

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,399
use them inside your infrastructure and

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,800
for building your

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,160
cyberspace monitoring

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,600
associate interview

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,720
linked to concert

16
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,960
so maybe i give an overview of the

17
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,320
program

18
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,639
and

19
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,720
i have a problem to

20
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,799
sorry

21
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,399
we are

22
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,479
so the plan

23
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,840
first we'll try to show and showcase

24
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,000
the

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,200
the

26
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,439
so the interest of open source why we

27
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,560
should rely on that field

28
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,040
to implement our

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,680
system and there is two parts in fact

30
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,080
there is a part concerning

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,919
which will be of interest for any

32
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,520
security official

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,680
how to strengthen your

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,080
security

35
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,680
architecture

36
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,080
deploying uh firewall needs and so on

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,840
second part

38
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,520
would be how to

39
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,480
establish a little cyber monitoring

40
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,680
system for safe spaces for national

41
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,200
assistance

42
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,760
on united system

43
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,360
big part of the training will be about

44
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,599
how to implement set activity so

45
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,160
system and tool open system of course

46
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,319
for cost management system concern

47
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,958
regarding warning process and unseen

48
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,480
process

49
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,360
and last and not this part will be on

50
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,560
forensics and investigation

51
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,519
so

52
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,720
maybe we'll start because

53
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
there is various demo made by the

54
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,920
engineers

55
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,159
nc and

56
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:13,040
received.tn during the training

57
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,040
we have

58
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,239
it will be possible after training to

59
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,360
organize session for hands-on on the

60
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,560
tools that

61
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,360
have been shown during this

62
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,000
this training but now we'll make only

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,159
because due to the concept of time

64
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,560
when you try to establish yourself

65
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,760
and you know

66
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,080
security architecture

67
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,040
there is a cost of equipment

68
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,000
that

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,480
the mast will be on the software tool

70
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,599
site when you have license fee

71
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,560
will

72
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,560
recurrent big annual maintenance fee

73
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,319
every year you have to pay maintenance

74
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,439
fees

75
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,599
so equipment are not really the big

76
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,200
cost center let's say for establishing

77
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,680
how to decrease the recover center and

78
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,160
also as you know in africa we have a big

79
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,400
problem of painful running at the

80
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,600
mission

81
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,960
procedure

82
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,080
so how to go through that

83
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,800
and devote delay of our

84
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,440
flourishing this is here or also for

85
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,720
adding additional services

86
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,800
and be able to more invest in capacity

87
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,160
building in fact that's the most

88
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,320
important thing for success and training

89
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,240
of associated staff

90
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,240
founding of the same activity like

91
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,080
severance campaign and so on

92
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,240
before the secularization of our

93
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,720
internal architecture as you know

94
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,160
associates

95
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,800
so a lot of hackers a lot of people will

96
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,400
try

97
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,919
to penetrate your

98
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,039
system

99
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,759
just fill for the challenge so you need

100
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,680
very strong

101
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,680
security architecture

102
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,320
for that you need a lot of tools

103
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,479
and values kind of tool also to be sure

104
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,160
we have the necessarily deployed

105
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,639
solution to protect correctly our

106
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,199
infrastructure

107
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,360
we need tool also for implementing this

108
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,960
here services and processes

109
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,639
that's another point for it specifically

110
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,880
and we need also values and

111
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,039
multi-platform heavy investigation and

112
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,120
forensic systems

113
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,680
so as you see the big budget

114
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,360
will come from

115
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,759
the software side from the licensing

116
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,120
side

117
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,880
especially as i said

118
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,520
those costs are accurate

119
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,199
concerning maintenance fee that you

120
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,160
should pay every year

121
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,280
so the solution comes from itself

122
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,520
is the use of open source tools i will

123
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,400
not say because

124
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,520
to

125
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,479
completely discard commercial tools no

126
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,560
to complement

127
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,520
that

128
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,000
good start and you try to

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,080
make the proof of concept that you have

130
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,720
enough tools and very good tools

131
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,600
to

132
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,319
really implement all of your activity

133
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,039
with open source

134
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,240
the beautiful world of open source we

135
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,199
have free license so let's concern cost

136
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,360
of deployment of

137
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,560
tools

138
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,960
also we have source code available in

139
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,919
this open way to customize those tools

140
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,880
to

141
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,600
drive to show you seth which

142
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,880
the system developed by

143
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,560
and

144
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,319
this

145
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,560
window will be opened

146
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,360
open to the respects responders

147
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,880
all of them

148
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,160
we have a very good guru now and

149
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
very good community assistance if you

150
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,840
have any problem just put it in the

151
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,440
mailing list of the tool and you have

152
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,479
various

153
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,599
users

154
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,639
or

155
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,560
developer of the tool that will answer

156
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,479
you immediately and better than

157
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,639
sometimes in conversion you know

158
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,840
assistance

159
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,560
panini d is proven

160
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,199
now we saw a lot of commercial solution

161
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,560
that disappears but you can see

162
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,560
uh

163
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,319
but for people who want you know

164
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,400
and to convince your

165
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,199
boss and so on and

166
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,240
that they need a very serious

167
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,440
support

168
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,560
a lot of now must have been so soon

169
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,919
offer contractual support and training

170
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,479
and the ship

171
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,280
that's why that you call open call in

172
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,319
fact

173
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,840
and

174
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,560
believe me the window is closing a

175
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,680
little bit

176
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,240
but still a lot of solutions still open

177
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,599
source and the community is behind and

178
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,520
there is no problem that there is a lot

179
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,319
of difference between what is offered

180
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,560
let's say between comma commercially and

181
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,080
suffer for the community so free

182
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,120
just some interfaces gui some little

183
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,360
functionality are offered on the

184
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,000
commercial between coma

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,360
a copy of the tools

186
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,919
mr nabil

187
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,080
that may conclusion any oppositive facts

188
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,320
as long as you expose your code there is

189
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,040
a lot of people that will give you all

190
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,680
to be here how that exists in its

191
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,040
vulnerability and then they approach

192
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,800
are closed

193
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,360
more repeating than in convention

194
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,240
to the facts

195
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,839
yes

196
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,120
i see

197
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,200
the only the first slide of your

198
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,360
presentation

199
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,839
oh

200
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,600
so there is a problem here with the

201
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
powerpoint

202
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,450
maybe

203
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,589
[Music]

204
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,880
sorry i will stop sharing and start

205
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,920
again sharing

206
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,560
do you see the slides

207
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,320
it's okay now

208
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,040
sorry so

209
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,040
there is a need of a lot of tools

210
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,360
and they need budgets and solutions open

211
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,760
source and that's concerning good for

212
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,519
the open source

213
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,160
and now let's come back to the meet so

214
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,640
if there was any soothing that

215
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,760
you know closed sources are very

216
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,880
variable so window will be the most

217
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,360
secure words and we all know what is the

218
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,120
situation

219
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,360
and believe me i got the occasion to

220
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,399
work on with the german

221
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,640
company on their

222
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,880
system developing you know we make some

223
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,680
eddy activity here in tunisia with our

224
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,600
young engineers very successfully it was

225
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,279
and first of all

226
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,440
what the guys told me we have a very

227
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,279
secure operating system for their

228
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,160
firewall that's what they say in their

229
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,079
brochure and so on

230
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,640
when we come to develop and customize

231
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,040
their tool we got of course the source

232
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,079
code and operating system we discovered

233
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,399
that the operating system was at that

234
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,120
time does

235
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
but in the brochure in the commercial

236
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,240
version we have our own operating system

237
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,959
very secure and so on so

238
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,200
there is insecurity in fact if you have

239
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,320
not you know access also to the

240
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,839
code to the source of the products

241
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,920
second might commission will have better

242
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,199
support like i just discussed

243
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,600
so store now have contractual

244
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,959
cheap support training assistance

245
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,600
and you can rely on the very rich and

246
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,160
friendly assistant from the community

247
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,120
that

248
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,160
is secure more secure concerning uh

249
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,519
assistance

250
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,920
believe me just post a question a

251
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,320
problem and you will have values made

252
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,120
coming explaining assisting you

253
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,959
so i don't think there is any problem

254
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,639
that if you want contracture on your

255
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,600
support this is feasible and this is how

256
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
you have access to the subcommission

257
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,880
training and assistance also with cheap

258
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,839
assets in fact

259
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,920
what open source will offer also the

260
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,839
external investments

261
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,240
by this free access to source code this

262
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,959
will be an enabler for research and

263
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,959
development activity

264
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,000
and will permit us is here to integrate

265
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,639
to customize them

266
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,320
gui starting but going deep and deep to

267
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,839
maybe perhaps develop new functionality

268
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,279
in the tools

269
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,839
and sharing it with the

270
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,200
community also you are the legal

271
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,680
provider of the security solution when

272
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,560
you go to assessor to

273
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,079
you know handle with them incidents

274
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,959
you

275
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,880
you will not let them you know you will

276
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,959
find especially in our country you will

277
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,920
find people without also fire sometimes

278
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,079
catastrophic situation

279
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,320
when you should at least immediately

280
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,639
provide some

281
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,120
strength of their security so and start

282
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,240
them needs a firewall should be you know

283
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,000
the

284
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,959
minimum things to do

285
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,800
for open source you will be a legal

286
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,639
provider of such solution you can do

287
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,519
that with commercial you have lots

288
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,120
have copy of that

289
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,680
because the copy is to you for you not

290
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,079
for the other clients but of course with

291
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,040
open sources you can do it and without

292
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,680
any problem

293
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,079
so let's start the first part of our

294
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,160
training is how to build your

295
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,560
security architecture with open source

296
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,839
tools

297
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,720
uh if there is any question please raise

298
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,560
your hand and maybe

299
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,480
and tracy with

300
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,600
us will again open the micro and you can

301
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,480
post your question

302
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,040
so now we'll go through how to

303
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,680
build the very strong security detection

304
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,760
of your network

305
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,160
and as i told you you have the

306
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,839
followers

307
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,760
will try to attack

308
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,639
any cert in the country just for the

309
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,279
challenge from inside or from outside so

310
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,160
to be sure that we have very strong

311
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,399
system very secure

312
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,360
it is very important for the reputation

313
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,959
of the third

314
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,519
if any incident will happen

315
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,920
or people who disgrace you and think

316
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,320
those people are not goods

317
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,560
so very important to have release

318
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,920
security architecture this is

319
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,320
interesting also for any security

320
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,680
official

321
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,440
let's see a little bit uh what's the

322
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,800
situation inside the generic template of

323
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,959
this

324
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,160
some people

325
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,959
create their sincere dress i will say i

326
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,760
will say search from now on knowing

327
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,839
certain sites sometimes another

328
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,600
organization

329
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,160
so you have the line of the

330
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
host of associate

331
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,959
your

332
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:17,920
land

333
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,360
and of course you'll be connected to

334
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,199
internet

335
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,959
you have will have server your internal

336
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,560
server

337
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,639
maybe we'll discuss that after you have

338
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,120
a service based monitoring system

339
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,600
and which contain the database coupled

340
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
with the database this is generic

341
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,360
template of

342
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,720
macro template of the shift

343
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,279
let's say how to start

344
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,240
securing this architecture

345
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,800
first of all what to do of course i will

346
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,079
go for people who are fluent in security

347
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,079
too sorry but

348
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,320
there is some people that maybe need a

349
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,000
little bit to understand what is the

350
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,720
firewall and so on you can do uh slowly

351
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,880
a little bit to explain to them it's an

352
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,560
occasion

353
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,600
sorry for that so for first protection

354
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,199
of the perimeter

355
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,120
uh external perimeter of the

356
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,839
network but also inside your network you

357
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,800
have one

358
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,880
segment with various security policy

359
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,519
very transitivity and you have to

360
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,600
dispatch those in values what you will

361
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,040
call dmz

362
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,160
to battle protect them

363
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,120
so what's the firing system

364
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,920
it's like checkpoints at the perimeter

365
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,120
of your network which will control

366
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,240
what can go inside your network and also

367
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,519
you can control

368
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,440
where your people will get out which

369
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
services are permitted

370
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,720
for

371
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,560
going to internet

372
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,720
but the principle is just

373
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,800
if people are customized with networking

374
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,160
of course

375
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,680
is to

376
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,160
block some parts

377
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,680
and by that we block all one propagation

378
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,679
and we just open the port for legitimate

379
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,839
services

380
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,480
so our network is now is well protected

381
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,959
from especially the small propagation

382
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,439
and services that we don't want they can

383
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,760
enter our network or can

384
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,039
go out of our network

385
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,760
so what the firewall do is the primitive

386
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,039
filtering but in but also out and you

387
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,880
can decide

388
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,120
which services with the protocol you

389
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,520
permit guys to use

390
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,640
uh

391
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,559
accessing to the internet

392
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,200
of course some services you know pdp and

393
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,760
so on are dungeons also for the internal

394
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,480
network and generally they have blocked

395
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,160
the

396
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,760
at the firewall

397
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,919
it will hide of course your association

398
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,760
terraces from

399
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,080
external you know

400
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,320
its firewall per meter protection

401
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,280
against attack based on probability of

402
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,240
communication protocol ddos who thinks

403
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,240
fluid and so on

404
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,919
but also very

405
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,320
important is permit to divide your

406
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,559
internal network in different zone of

407
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,600
security what we call dns that demonize

408
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,960
that

409
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,160
zone in fact but in fact militarize it

410
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,520
so you know

411
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,280
different zone of

412
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,720
high security

413
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,039
of the various level of security and

414
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,799
also of high security

415
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,760
with access control between those

416
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,320
a fire does not

417
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,559
control internal attack

418
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,880
you know it's just at the frontier of

419
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,440
your network so although it's happening

420
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,160
inside the network it cannot be seen by

421
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,080
the firewall

422
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,799
by its own it cannot also protect you

423
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,799
against content

424
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,600
based attack content

425
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,320
since we just blocked ports and so on

426
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,960
but you will see that you can add other

427
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,760
tools at the level of firewall that can

428
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,320
permit also to protect the game content

429
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,639
set

430
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,280
so if we go to our architecture what we

431
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,480
do now is to partition our network

432
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,720
you know we have the uncertainty which

433
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,559
is very critical

434
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,520
we have

435
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,080
and the rest of the team i chose that

436
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,160
divide that into two but you can more

437
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,480
divide so for everyone

438
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,240
from the internal network you will

439
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,960
create based on securities

440
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,559
with proper security policy

441
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,039
so since your thoughts of course you can

442
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,440
isolate them the most they can do

443
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,200
not a lot maybe

444
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,600
from the ccc you can accept some of the

445
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,000
services controlled access but they

446
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,840
cannot enter our internal network if

447
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,240
there is

448
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,600
of confidentiality very high so we put

449
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,200
them in their own zone

450
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,120
and the other teams maybe you can put

451
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,760
them all together but we can divide more

452
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,960
and

453
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,679
others teams we can subdivide them in

454
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,880
various zones

455
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,240
server will be protected in well

456
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,799
protected in their own zone you see

457
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,559
which can access observer

458
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,600
if you have database for monitoring of

459
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,640
the cyberspace we put that aside because

460
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,039
it's critical because we'll have our

461
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,159
system

462
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,840
gaining some information from the

463
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,720
outside from the internet but

464
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,280
it has to be corporate not coupled with

465
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,799
databases

466
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,120
so we can do what we want

467
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,320
partitioning our internal network into

468
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,799
values

469
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,799
of security

470
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,679
and

471
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,240
instituting a security policy for it's

472
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,720
done relatively to its scientificity

473
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,440
so

474
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,080
some people told you firewalls are not

475
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,400
really able to fire all the intensities

476
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,880
at the perimeter of your

477
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,400
network if it happened it got down so it

478
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,280
blocked all your access to internet

479
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,280
so normally we what we do is we have two

480
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,960
firewall

481
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,400
working

482
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,640
all together at the same time if one

483
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,799
fall down the other will take the heat

484
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,720
and we'll continue

485
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,440
you know providing you know access to

486
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,559
the external network to the internet

487
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,480
this is provided by some commercial

488
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,480
services

489
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,559
but

490
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,280
we can do it also with open source we

491
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,159
have various tool guard bfc

492
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,720
that we can put onto two servers

493
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,679
and they introduce this heartbeat you

494
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,919
know

495
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,440
so

496
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,640
we have a firewall

497
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,240
filing system that could not be

498
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,120
down completely if one will be down the

499
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,360
other will continue and give you access

500
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,159
to the external network so the social

501
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,559
existence also with firewall with open

502
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,280
source solution

503
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,759
[Music]

504
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,960
can expect also the content what is

505
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,679
going on on those legitimate flow in

506
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,640
fact that people can't consent attack

507
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,080
you know uh on the problem

508
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,400
you have with what we call utm when they

509
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,360
fight and statement

510
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,619
[Music]

511
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,480
and we can also introduce access control

512
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,200
and that no one can actually

513
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,960
of tools

514
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,679
in reality

515
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,799
also at the point if you will

516
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,120
connect to other external networks

517
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,200
if you have subsidiary or

518
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,679
so once those are going from the

519
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,240
internet

520
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,120
now we'll

521
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,880
introduce one tool which is pf cells an

522
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,600
example and on which there will a demo

523
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,720

[Music]

525
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,320
this is very good tool

526
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,640
it's a stateful firearm

527
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,320
for a very rich

528
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,000
federal capability

529
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,960

connection and so on it's a very

534
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,000
good web interface for the configuration

535
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,880
for companies and very good graphical

you to

539
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,039
see what's going on at the level of the

540
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,159
firearms

541
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,400
it can run in many investigation

542
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,679
environments

543
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,480
it offers high availability through the

544
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,039
software type and ps3 you have just

545
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,799
he

546
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,880
over is

547
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,960
the http server only and so on

548
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,960
what is interesting also and what we do

549
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,799
a lot of time is

550
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,960
buy one click and we don't show you that

551
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,960
the communication that you are learning

552

[Music]

553
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,919
so there is very easy

554
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,400
the integration and solubility of

555
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,760
console solution as you can see from

556
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,240
from pf sas we can integrate wirelessly

557
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,640
from various uh what is open source

558
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,640
solution

559
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,039
he

560
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,039
uh

561
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,840
tools like svg graphs

562
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,240
pc server in fact one gigahertz

563
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,080
one gigabit of ram

564
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,360
would be enough

565
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,600
of course they banned about the size of

566
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,840

demo

588
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,919
i will stop

589
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,799

thank you mr nabil i will share my

591
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,520
screen

592
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,279
do you see my screen

593
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,519
yes on dare we see your screen yes

594
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,799
thank you

595
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,720
so we will start with the first uh

596
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,880
demonstration about

597
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,600
the pf sans firewall

598
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,880
which is

599
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,000
an open source feature rich firewall

600
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,720
along with firewall services it also

601
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,880
performs a variety of

602
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,880
network and security related functions

603
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,080
and it's run on freebsd

604
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,600
and practically

605
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,039
all management

606
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,679
of the firewall

607
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,640
after

608
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,519
uh the initial configure configuration

609
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,840
and the initial setup

610
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,600
is done through the graphical user

611
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,960
interface so first of all what does the

612
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,640
pf sense stand for so pf does mean

613
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,679
packet filtering and the sense does mean

614
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,760
we need to make sense to packet

615
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,039
filtering

616
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,600
and that is the origin of the pf sense

617
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,799
so

618
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,080
in this demo

619
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,799
i will show you the pf sense gui the

620
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,880
graphical user interface

621
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,480
we see

622
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,919
the features

623
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,120
and we will

624
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
base our demo on this

625
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,039
architecture

626
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,320
here is the firewall pf sans we have a

627
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,240
dmc

628
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,399
zone we have one interface and

629
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,640
the lan interface

630
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,200
we will i will show you how to create a

631
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,399
dmz

632
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,200
uh interface with the pf sans how to

633
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,559
create a rule

634
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,200
we will allow access to in to the

635
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,080
internet from the dmz

636
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,799
subnet to multiple ports and we allow

637
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,600
traffic from lan network to the web

638
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,919
server which is inside the dmz zone and

639
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,840
we will block traffic from a specific

640
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,720
address it's just an example

641
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,080
is it's up to you to to make your rules

642
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,279
to make your uh your your configuration

643
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,640
uh basic on your policy and your

644
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,919
security strategy on your organization

645
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,200
so first of all i will

646
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,399
log into the pf sense dashboard we have

647
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,279
here

648
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,519
an informational

649
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,240
dashboard we have a system information

650
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,080
the interfaces and the traffic

651
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,480
graphs

652
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,080
we can customize the dashboard

653
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,880
by

654
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,440
available widget

655
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,080
here we can add

656
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,519
the status of services which is here you

657
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,679
can start and you can stop and you can

658
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,360
reload any unsolid services

659
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,960
you can also

660
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,840
add a firewall logs

661
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,320
the interface statics

662
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,399
we we can

663
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,440
add the suricata alerts we can show you

664
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,799
this this again and you can

665
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,919
customize the dashboard by the picture

666
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,399
of your organization

667
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,159
so

668
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,119
i will start by creating the dmz

669
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,280
interface so i will delete this

670
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,399
interface

671
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,760
first of all

672
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,280
i we will choose

673
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,679
interface assignments

674
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,480
and we will add here

675
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,399
the new interfaces

676
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,320
opt does mean the optional interface

677
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,399
which refer to any additional interface

678
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:39,918
other than the one and the line

679
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,839
we will choose the name of this

680
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,440
interface dmz

681
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,399
and we we will enable this interface

682
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,520
for ipv4 configuration type we will

683
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,480
choose static ipv4

684
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,359
and

685
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,200
i will assign this ip address to the

686
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,119
this interface

687
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,400
so

688
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,480
after this workshop and this uh training

689
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,079
we will give you

690
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,040
uh a credential next week to access to

691
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,200
uh all tools and all the platform so do

692
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,280
not hesitate to put your email on the

693
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,400
chat zoom

694
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,280
so after putting the the ip address i

695
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,520
will click to save

696
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,480
and

697
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,160
we need to apply

698
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,320
any change

699
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,320
here

700
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,480
and now the interface dmz is up and this

701
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,119
is the ip address

702
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:41,920
so

703
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,880
here

704
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,240
there is a lot of feature offered by

705
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,599
pf sans

706
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,240
here there is a vpn the virtual private

707
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,359
network

708
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,920
ipsec

709
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,599
l2tp openvpn

710
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,160
there is also

711
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,400
we give you a possibility to to make

712
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,359
high availability synchronization

713
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,400
we need another node or another

714
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,240
firewall

715
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,040
cluster and we can put the another ip

716
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,480
and the credential

717
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,280
for

718
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,599
the the other pf sounds

719
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,440
we have the diagnostics options there is

720
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,560
a lot of

721
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,320
tools if there is any issue on our

722
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,280
pf sounds or or our network

723
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,280
so

724
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,560
uh i will give you uh

725
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,079
more details about the interface so

726
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,880
the interface one does mean

727
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,800
wide area network

728
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,680
is the untrusted public network outside

729
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,640
of the firewall the lan referred to

730
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,920
local area network uh is the commonly

731
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,359
private side of the firewall and the dmz

732
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,320
is a demilitarized zone

733
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,480
which is an area

734
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,839
where public servers are reachable from

735
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,880
the outside or are reachable from the

736
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,480
internet

737
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,160
so now

738
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,520
it's okay for

739
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,240
uh

740
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,359
dmz interface now we will

741
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,760
i will show you how to create

742
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,640
rules

743
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,200
first of all we will allow traffic from

744
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,680
dmz subnet to

745
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,920
http power

746
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,200
and allow not traffic from dmz subnet to

747
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,880
dns ports and

748
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,119
a low traffic from dmz subnet to

749
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,880
https

750
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,280
port and

751
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,040
we want to to to give access from dmz

752
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,640
subnet to network to to internet if we

753
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,440
have

754
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,880
any update

755
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,040
and so on so first of all we need we

756
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,040
choose firewall

757
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,560
rules

758
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,880
and we select the dmz interface

759
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,359
by default there is no rule defined on

760
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,119
this interface we click add

761
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,160
and

762
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,240
when we create a rule we need to assign

763
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,280
this rule to interface or to interfaces

764
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,640
so in general rules are

765
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,920
read from top to the bottom in the list

766
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,839
and the traffic is

767
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,839
proceeded based on the first match rule

768
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:26,880
so

769
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,920
we we choose pass for the action

770
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,960
the interface is dmc

771
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,880
for the source we will choose dmz net

772
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,839
and for the destination we will choose

773
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,240
any

774
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,960
and i will select

775
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,240
http bar

776
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,920
for the destination part

777
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,880
and

778
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,200
it's

779
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,119
it's important to add a description

780
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,200
allow

781
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,598
traffic

782
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,160
ggb bar

783
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,119
and we can enable log packet filter that

784
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,160
are handed by this rule and we click

785
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,480
save

786
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,200
we repeat this for the other parts

787
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,040
so we select tmc network

788
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,400
and

789
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,599
for the part we select https

790
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,960
and you click save

791
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,280
and if we have many

792
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,720
rules

793
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,400
you can use

794
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,079
this icon to copy this rules

795
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,640
now we will choose for the protocol for

796
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,440
the dns we will choose tcp and udp

797
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,760
and i will select dns port

798
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,960
and we need to apply

799
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,000
change

800
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,079
by this button

801
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,880
now we have this three

802
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,880
rules on the dmz interface

803
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,640
uh

804
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,599
after that i will allow traffic from lan

805
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,520
network to the web server inside the dmz

806
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,359
so there is

807
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,880
here uh aliases it's very important to

808
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,480
use aliases

809
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,160
to make

810
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,440
easier creating the rule we need here

811
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,680
the name of web server

812
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:51,160
and i will put the ip of the web server

813
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,640
we click save

814
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,960
we apply change

815
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,920
and we choose rules

816
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,520
on the lan

817
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,920
i will add

818
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,400
rules

819
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,200
so for the action

820
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,960
i will choose pass

821
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,480
for the interface

822
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,880
this is lan and for

823
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,240
the source

824
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,440
we click

825
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,359
lan network

826
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,760
and for the destination i will choose

827
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,079
single host or alias

828
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,520
and we put

829
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,240
web server demo

830
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,400
and we will choose the power http

831
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,359
and i click save

832
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,800
this is

833
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,160
this is the rule

834
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,319
of permit

835
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,280
access from the lan to the web server

836
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,800
demonstration

837
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,319
so i can test

838
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,119
this rule

839
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,319
here this is the lan network and i will

840
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:09,160
access to the dmz web server

841
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:34,598
this is the ip of the web server

842
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,240
wonder

843
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,280
yes

844
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,599
you come back to pf sounds

845
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:52,880
okay

846
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,119
and for the dmz uh the ip it's

847
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,119
the mask it's uh

848
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,720
go to firewall interface

849
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,640
no no for the

850
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,839
for the pf sounds

851
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,119
go to interface the interfaces

852
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,520
dmz

853
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,200
and i think to change the mask

854
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,599
the mask

855
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,520
no no go google

856
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,400
this

857
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,720
it's okay for for the muscle

858
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,118
it's okay

859
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,520
so

860
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,700
normally we can

861
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,400
[Music]

862
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,839
so after after the the configuration of

863
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,160
this rule normally we have access from

864
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,879
the land network to to the web server

865
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,119
so

866
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,319
this is the demonstration about rules

867
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,960
and about

868
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,480
p.f sans

869
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,599
uh i give now the floor to mr nabil to

870
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,079
continue with the presentation i and i

871
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,680
come back to you

872
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,040
with the

873
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,319
installation of uh package syrica

874
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,560
thank you

875
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,200
thank you

876
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,839
the purpose to show how

877
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:22,880
configure

878
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,680
you know the quality of interfaces of my

879
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,240
vertical

880
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,280
hands interface and so on as i told you

881
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,720
you cannot realize that people are

882
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,960
interested you know special

883
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,680
training on installation and also

884
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,880
configuration going step by step so that

885
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,440
you can follow correctly what's going on

886
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,280
thank you wonderful

887
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,440
thank you mr nabeel

888
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,480
and maybe you show after the viciousness

889
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,640
as i talk you can install other tools on

890
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,160
the firewall to

891
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,319
better protect your infrastructure

892
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,560
so

893
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,599
let's continue

894
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:16,050
[Music]

895
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,000
we go through

896
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,280
and

897
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,760
this will give

898
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,160
opportunity to hackers to use the sport

899
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,440
and try to

900
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,599
to enter your fire through those parts

901
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,839
so we need another level of protection

902
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,520
in fact

903
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,000
for what concern

904
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,240
the internal network to control what

905
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,879
three are

906
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,319
and that's the purpose

907
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,359
of something

908
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,880
you be able to speak a little bit louder

909
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,640
into the microphone you're very soft

910
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,839
so now

911
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,599
let me install it

912
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,680
the first firewall as associated you

913
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,480
need a very strong architecture we need

914
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,359
in fact only one firewall the firewall

915
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,000
is a software tool and he can also have

916
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
an ability inside

917
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,800
that will appear

918
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,079
that should not be the same product

919
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,800
so if there is a vulnerability in the

920
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,920
first one the second one would be okay

921
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,680
and vice versa

922
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,160
so generally

923
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,400
you know platform two firewalls from

924
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,400
different you know open source

925
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,319
typically the architecture is to have

926
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:09,119
two firewalls if someone is vulnerable

927
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,760
here sometimes you don't need

928
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,559
very heavy you know control because we

929
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,680
enter you know some website in fact

930
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,040
let's say other monitoring

931
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,880
and for that you have a choice you have

932
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,559
a choice to choose another tools open

933
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,160
source

934
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,720
the rgbl which is a next generation file

935
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,200
with deep protocol analysis

936
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,160
that is ng firewall but this one is one

937
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,119
medium-sized network but config server

938
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,240
fire smooth wall engine and so on you

939
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,839
have each offer a firewall but we

940
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,800
can choose another one to deploy as an

941
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,440
additive protection of the perimeter of

942
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,640
your network

943
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,599
now let's go what i was

944
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,359
introducing is

945
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:08,880
the open product

946
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,720
to file as a

947
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,640
knowledge he should open http

948
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,800
through that spot can climb some attacks

949
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,040
so what we need is an inclusion

950
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,119
detection tool

951
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:24,880
to control

952
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,559
if there is attack

953
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:31,119
exploiting these open ports and

954
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,880
what is the principle of these tools in

955
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,880
the network lps

956
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,839
is

957
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,480
a tentative attack through an open port

958
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,280
he can react immediately at different

959
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,800
what we call lips

960
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,920
and stop the attack or tcp attack can be

961
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,839
stopped immediately

962
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,079
when not permitting them to go further

963
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,000
inspecting the inside network

964
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,359
so it doesn't

965
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:22,720
delay ultimate flow with sniffer in fact

966
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,720
on the network we do

967
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,040
and

968
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,359
intrusion detection system when he

969
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:43,760
stopped the attack we call it

970
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,240
ips nips

971
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,160
network intrusion prevention system

972
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,200
because so all tcp you know

973
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,280
basis attack has opportunities that the

974
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,880
coffee gp

975
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,760
data

976
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,079
protocol there is difficulty to stop

977
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:01,040
them

978
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,160
but what you can do in nibs is to

979
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,400
configure the firewall to say to the

980
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,960
firewall hey there is i

981
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,280
observed an attack coming from this ip

982
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,319
address

983
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:15,119
and he sent him a new rule to block this

984
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,640
ip address so he blocked also the udp

985
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,800
until the flow

986
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,440
and there is a good interaction between

987
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,640
firewalls open source firewalls and nibs

988
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,359
open source snips to permit that easily

989
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,200
the one of the best tools is not the

990
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,240
oldest one but the problem only with the

991
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,720
smart is scanned literally that it was

992
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,960
acquired by cisco in 2013

993
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,760
but people found snot

994
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,160
take the head and say we should concern

995
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,720
the open source new persian

996
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,680
life and cisco accepted that

997
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,280
and still today you know offered the

998
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,119
community version

999
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,880
just a little

1000
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,520
problem is when you need

1001
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,720
a fresh signature because the needs

1002
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,359
will always have to be updated signature

1003
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:13,200
of attack this government has to be

1004
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,800
updated at the level of the

1005
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,319
nips

1006
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:19,359
so

1007
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:21,440
you should pay a little bit

1008
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,359
around 400

1009
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:26,160
a year by sensor if you for business

1010
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,200
usage

1011
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,440
will be just thirty dollars if for

1012
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,240
educational personal use

1013
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,760
and but still a signature of one's minus

1014
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,680
one still free

1015
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,640
but of course you need good protection

1016
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,680
so it's not very expensive in fact if

1017
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,680
you don't agree that

1018
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,440
has reacted to that

1019
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,960
and they are offering

1020
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:49,920
rich

1021
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,040
and fresh signature for snort and hard

1022
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,480
tools as a reaction of this attitude

1023
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,119
of cisco

1024
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,640
for example silicate the other two

1025
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,000
which is

1026
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,480
combined nips in fact but also network

1027
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,599
security monitoring and also can go

1028
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,920
more deeper to pick up you know to go to

1029
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,119
the

1030
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,359
level of your pact and make your own

1031
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,839
inspection of what's going on it's

1032
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:20,559
developed by your acf it's a very high

1033
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:22,800
performance nips

1034
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,400
because if you

1035
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,200
take

1036
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,359
full advantage of multicore processors

1037
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,480
very efficient intuition detection high

1038
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,359
speed traffic

1039
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,640
sometimes

1040
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,599
very specific attack

1041
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,640
the nips is to put a lot of

1042
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,680
flow

1043
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,280
so the nib

1044
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,680
is overloaded a little bit and through

1045
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,880
the tank you had to insert the attack

1046
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,960
knowing that the lip

1047
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,960
is overloaded

1048
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,839
this is the solution is better

1049
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,960
protect against those kind of attack

1050
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,160
we have another solution to protection

1051
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,800
i will talk about this few minutes we

1052
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,800
have another very good tool developed by

1053
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,559
berkeley chevrolet

1054
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,440
which is based on behavioral approach

1055
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,960
so

1056
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,839
the next knowledge

1057
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,960
is based on signature that you have to

1058
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,079
update

1059
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,720
every time

1060
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,200
communication

1061
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,119
any content-based attack exists so his

1062
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,680
behavioral approach he can detect

1063
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,400
zero-day attack and you need such kind

1064
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,680
of tools because for many high security

1065
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,200
level entities

1066
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,359
generally

1067
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,240
attacked is a very new attack not

1068
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:52,040
yet when unknown

1069
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,839
language for detecting new attack

1070
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:04,079
he can trigger attacks on his necks his

1071
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:07,799
compatibility is

1072
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,040
you know signature of attacks existent

1073
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,720
attack but he can also discover new one

1074
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,359
and he has a very good learning mode

1075
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,359
because the problem with those tools

1076
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:22,720
sometimes legitimate flow

1077
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,160
are

1078
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:28,240
marked as you know tentative of attacks

1079
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,119
you have first to configure it to show

1080
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,400
and if you have an internal scanner

1081
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,079
that make the

1082
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:38,000
vulnerability assessment of your soul

1083
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,480
for example he is a guy acting as an

1084
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,280
attacker so i have to tell him no

1085
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,359
don't

1086
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:47,599
you know put those after attack i know

1087
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,839
that i'm making vulnerabilities coming

1088
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:51,200
and so on

1089
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,160
and after that he can work very easily

1090
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,559
and very well

1091
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,520
so maybe we like i told you there will

1092
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,359
be a

1093
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,680
virtual you know network or as you

1094
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,599
explained it and will be available

1095
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,200
online i saw that you send your email

1096
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,280
thanks for that and we will

1097
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,480
give you also mailing lists to

1098
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,040
post us

1099
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:28,799
and better explain your needs and so on

1100
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,160
so now we'll go to the second

1101
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,160
demonstration

1102
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,040
again

1103
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,400
we'll show you

1104
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,760
uh

1105
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,240
in fact

1106
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,319
as he said

1107
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,880
in the

1108
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:53,689
[Music]

1109
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,880
to see what's going on

1110
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,200
it's okay for my screen

1111
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,400
okay okay so we continue with

1112
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,119
with the next demonstration which

1113
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:26,640
we will show you

1114
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,359
how to install a package on

1115
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:32,720
pf science this package is a

1116
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,920
suricata which is a network

1117
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,480
intrusion detection system

1118
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,280
so

1119
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,960
uh we choose system and we choose uh

1120
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,880
package manager we have a lot of package

1121
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,160
there is

1122
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,520
uh already many unstyled package and we

1123
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,640
have if if we we want to install a new

1124
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,720
package we click available packages

1125
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,079
so we need

1126
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:03,839
just to click on install and the package

1127
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:06,480
will be installed

1128
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,920
so here surikata is already installed

1129
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,359
first of all we need to configure the

1130
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:14,480
package

1131
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,960
on the surface on the services we choose

1132
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,280
suricata

1133
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,839
and we need two

1134
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:25,520
settings the rules so we need to check

1135
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,559
uh

1136
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:30,079
which rules are used here we will use

1137
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,040
et open emerging threat rule et for

1138
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,400
emerging threat

1139
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,400
we we select

1140
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,760
this option and we will use a custom uh

1141
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,480
url for uh at open downloads and we put

1142
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,480
the uh

1143
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,839
the link here

1144
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:50,640
for uh downloaded rules

1145
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,759
we select also

1146
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:58,160
the theater.net c2 ip rule set

1147
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,440
also for the abuse dot ch

1148
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:06,559
and we hide deprecated rules category

1149
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,200
we can choose the interval of updated

1150
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,480
rules

1151
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,839
six hour or one day or for today it's up

1152
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:17,200
to you to change this option

1153
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,680
and we click we click save

1154
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,640
after that we choose updates

1155
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,000
to update

1156
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,119
our

1157
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:30,319
rule set

1158
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:34,640
we just need to click on update

1159
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,119
so here the last update was

1160
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,119
yesterday

1161
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:52,240
the signature of attacks just yes

1162
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,079
so for this

1163
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:57,760
the first update

1164
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,359
it

1165
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,640
take time

1166
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,760
i will so close this this task

1167
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:04,799
and

1168
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:06,160
i will show you

1169
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:06,960
we

1170
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:07,690
we

1171
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:10,160
[Music]

1172
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,440
we will choose

1173
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,640
the

1174
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,640
interface to monitor

1175
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,680
which is

1176
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,799
the one

1177
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,920
and here the address

1178
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,760
of the one interface

1179
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,240
so now we will

1180
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,119
choose another ipv from the outside from

1181
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:31,040
the internet and we will attack this ip

1182
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,839
to to see the detected

1183
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:36,400
malicious traffic so

1184
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,520
here

1185
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,640
this is the the the threat actor

1186
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,599
ip

1187
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,520
and we will choose the

1188
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,760
alert option to see

1189
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,160
the attack in real time

1190
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,040
so we will clear clear this log

1191
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,480
we will choose

1192
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,599
network mapper to scan

1193
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,119
our ip

1194
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:00,079
sv

1195
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:02,480
for service version

1196
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,280
and

1197
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,599
the script

1198
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:06,480
is

1199
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,839
to to detect the vulnerability or

1200
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:12,480
any ip

1201
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,359
and i will attack my

1202
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:18,680
one interface

1203
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:25,839
and

1204
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:29,440
we need to show here the source ip

1205
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,079
of the threat actor

1206
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,559
there is also another

1207
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,559
threat actors that

1208
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:07,599
scan

1209
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:10,240
my ip

1210
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:11,920
and

1211
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,920
our scan is detected

1212
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,280
potentially bad traffic and this is

1213
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,680
the ip of the threat actor and this is

1214
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,799
the signature et scan suspicious inbound

1215
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:24,960
to ms sql for

1216
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,640
traffic or mysql port and

1217
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,400
other other many

1218
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,880
signature

1219
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,079
all all this detected the traffic are

1220
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:40,319
show in the alert log view filter

1221
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,920
it's an ongoing attack

1222
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,160
and we can see all the the information

1223
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,799
of the attack here we see the protocol

1224
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:51,440
we see the date we see the category or

1225
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,640
the class of the alert the source ip

1226
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,440
and

1227
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,280
the destination which is the one

1228
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:02,160
interface and here it's the description

1229
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,079
so that's it for the siricata

1230
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:06,000
demonstration

1231
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,440
cinebill e the floor is you

1232
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,079
it is yours

1233
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,839
thanks mother

1234
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:16,400
as you see and we can program of course

1235
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,559
action and you can see that

1236
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:22,000
at the level of the same

1237
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,280
tools you can install values tools

1238
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,359
silicata is not the

1239
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:29,680
same because pf cells but there is

1240
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,599
interaction between them

1241
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:32,960
and as you

1242
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,920
do so we were able to

1243
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,559
to install it on the other one rapidly

1244
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:40,960
and easily with integrated interface

1245
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,599
between the two

1246
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,760
so the problem

1247
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:59,680
is now with needs nips as you've

1248
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,440
understood a little bit

1249
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,920
nips is a needs active he can't stop the

1250
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:04,880
attack

1251
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,640
nip needs just log as the uh

1252
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,200
monster configured but he can indeed

1253
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,400
that uh

1254
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,039
silicata actor does the nips the action

1255
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:17,760
and so can be made stop the attack not

1256
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,359
just lock

1257
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:22,319
now the problem with needs is that

1258
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:24,559
there is a lot of efficiency in case of

1259
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:25,520
high

1260
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,760
as like i told you there is possible

1261
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,960
overload of the needs is a sensor but if

1262
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,599
there is a lot of tentative of attacks

1263
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,680
we can overload it

1264
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,000
uh silicata is a high performance one

1265
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,359
which is very difficult to do but

1266
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:44,559
still possible and in the excellent

1267
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:46,559
situation it's still possible there is

1268
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:48,720
various tools that do that work like

1269
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,960
flag rooter and so on that

1270
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,960
try to overload the needs and

1271
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,079
after that try to enter an attack that

1272
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:00,720
in certain attack when the needs we know

1273
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,240
it's overloaded

1274
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,599
it's not very efficient to get

1275
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,280
distributed attack and advanced

1276
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:08,559
diversion techniques sometimes he can

1277
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:11,119
now he suffers with a lot of switch of

1278
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,720
course

1279
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,039
as a sensor he has to have access to all

1280
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:16,480
the flow

1281
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,960
so we have to have switch mirroring bolt

1282
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,319
on which we put the needs of the nips

1283
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:24,319
but the problem can also form encrypted

1284
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:26,960
flow when you open if you now we are

1285
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,640
going to ipv6 and sometimes

1286
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,559
as you sail the sensor it's a sensor

1287
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:34,640
it's observing the flow if they are

1288
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,720
encrypted of course he cannot discover

1289
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,760
an attack because the flow are encrypted

1290
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,520
so a companion solution to stand

1291
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,760
the protection of network is what we

1292
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,200
call earth

1293
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,000
based

1294
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,280
ips

1295
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,359
or host ideas

1296
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:54,160
you understood the difference ids ips is

1297
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,640
it active or just log

1298
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,359
so they don't depend on traffic load

1299
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:00,960
they are efficient to get distributed

1300
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,200
attack and the aet

1301
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,119
of diversion technique and left maybe

1302
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:07,680
vpn without any problem because they

1303
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,000
understand that the level of workstation

1304
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,039
so after the flow were decrypted and you

1305
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,760
can disturb if an attack is coming in

1306
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,680
through the tunnels of the vpn

1307
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,640
that's why we have to

1308
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,520
start them also in our network and we

1309
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,160
have tools that we can manage

1310
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,319
we have central management

1311
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,880
because i understand that the level of

1312
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,319
you know sensitive

1313
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:36,960
server and a lot of organization and

1314
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,720
there is possibility to make central

1315
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,480
americas

1316
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,640
yes to crush eps

1317
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,200
one good solution yourself which

1318
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,599
discover a lot of root kits after

1319
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:49,760
getting intensive attacks at the level

1320
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,400
of reproduction they make log analysis

1321
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,440
to discover there is a

1322
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,920
possibility of intrusion and check the

1323
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,119
integrity of fight system and process of

1324
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:03,119
super mutant news process they are

1325
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,200
available on our platform

1326
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,480
mac

1327
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,480
linux vmware

1328
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,640
and of course on the platform

1329
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:14,000
they can also interact with the ips

1330
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,119
to every discovery to interact between

1331
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,920
the two tools we have can configure the

1332
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,400
alerts that they send you an email and

1333
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,319
they discover there is a tentative of

1334
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:26,000
attack or

1335
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,559
also you can program the response so to

1336
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,880
stop the attack there is simplified

1337
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,880
conflict management servers to manage

1338
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,119
policy classes because

1339
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,760
all the workstation on the vtl starts at

1340
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,720
eds and they are compliant with pce dss

1341
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,119
for the banking sector and so on as you

1342
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:44,960
see there is a lot of rich functionality

1343
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,280
respect of standard respect of you know

1344
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,520
contract and campaigns requirements also

1345
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,440
in open source schools

1346
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:53,280
another good tool is

1347
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,680
good centralized logging and maintenance

1348
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:56,880
is somehow

1349
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,039
which provides some functionality but

1350
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:00,480
really

1351
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,480
good centralized learning and mentors

1352
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,799
but the most famous so say in fact the

1353
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:07,520
most popular

1354
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:11,680
now so in our network we divided our

1355
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:15,760
zone with dmz and ozone when we isolate

1356
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,920
our teams and our

1357
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,120
server

1358
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,040
and the system

1359
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,479
and

1360
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:24,880
it should be that we'll install nibs at

1361
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,279
the level of all

1362
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,679
the internal of all those

1363
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:32,799
zones to discover if they're an attack

1364
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:36,158
that goes through the firewall

1365
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:39,679
so we can start as many needs as we want

1366
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:42,238
since they are license free

1367
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:44,880
that's sometimes we need to cut in a

1368
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,679
number of tools which means more

1369
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:51,600
licensed or more expensive license

1370
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:55,839
we'll install also her gds on server and

1371
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:58,479
all sensitive workstation to discover if

1372
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:01,759
an attack has those of the lips and

1373
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:04,839
as i explained before

1374
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:07,278
so have

1375
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,279
we have now

1376
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:12,399
a good you know protected system network

1377
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:14,000
protected

1378
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:14,719
we

1379
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:17,600
make some work now when puts tools

1380
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,880
doesn't mean anything if you

1381
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,080
driver for tax

1382
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,399
so we will make an overview a little bit

1383
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:40,880
of administration tool the thing that we

1384
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,520
have very powerful tools for processing

1385
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,439
and for resting

1386
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:46,799
from the

1387
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:49,799
uh

1388
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,840
to implement

1389
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,320
security base

1390
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,199
who basically said the number twos and

1391
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:21,120
the interaction between

1392
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,280
school and we can clearly analyze the

1393
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,600
errors coming from smart needs

1394
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,120
system second

1395
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,520
stagnated news correlation between

1396
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,080
parents so you can discover you know

1397
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,560
distributed attack more easily with

1398
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,800
those kind of tools watch

1399
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,760
it

1400
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,679
that is the pre-configured you know

1401
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:41,760
entities that you want to be elected

1402
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,320
about it

1403
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,679
[Music]

1404
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:51,239
but there is

1405
01:10:56,460 --> 01:11:02,160
[Laughter]

1406
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:08,719
[Music]

1407
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:12,440
we have this problem

1408
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:30,640
a very good tool which made coloration

1409
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,760
by its own he has a very

1410
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:34,640
uh

1411
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,679
powerful enzyme for processing

1412
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:39,360
the two disasters

1413
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,040
which was

1414
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,159
took as departure for the uh system

1415
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:46,400
which will be presented after

1416
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,640
so it's a scene which make event

1417
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,960
correlation but normalization after that

1418
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,040
correlation of the various log of

1419
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,560
various events

1420
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,199
he can combine log access data and

1421
01:11:57,199 --> 01:12:00,800
discovery that i can show you

1422
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,960
not very visible

1423
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,480
of attack through that correlation

1424
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,719
so it's very important to have all the

1425
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:11,840
cn inside of your network to discover or

1426
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,400
distribute the attack and to be alerted

1427
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,560
very rapidly that an attack is going

1428
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,560
wrong of course so there is a little

1429
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,360
piece of electron a very sturdy inside

1430
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,960
that from the needs

1431
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,760
are from the hashid yes as you see we

1432
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:29,120
work with a lot of tools now

1433
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,760
attack measures also for traffic

1434
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,550
analysis in case of leaders there is

1435
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:41,099
[Music]

1436
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,560
that can be used to correlate and to

1437
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,960
come out and to

1438
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,000
i went to uh at the start of any attack

1439
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,920
with correlating

1440
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,800
the event from one's rewards security

1441
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:01,960
tool let me understand it inside of

1442
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,960
i

1443
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,560
you're very very quiet is there any

1444
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,560
possibility you can

1445
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:33,000
maybe switch a microphone or

1446
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,000
it's very low yes you've kind of been

1447
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,120
cycling

1448
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:43,080
um you sound very far

1449
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,000
okay

1450
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,320
just a second mr maybe i will give you a

1451
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,760
mic

1452
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,239
okay thank you

1453
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,199
okay we can

1454
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:09,120
come back with

1455
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,640
michael's off

1456
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,880
too you know i should have used the open

1457
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,640
source tools anyway

1458
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,040
so second tool that you need inside your

1459
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,400
network is you have to always scan

1460
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,400
all your servers and workstation to

1461
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:25,280
discover vulnerability before interlude

1462
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:26,800
will discover that

1463
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,800
so we need to periodically uh

1464
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,120
you know make vulnerability assessment

1465
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,640
of our infrastructure to see if we have

1466
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,679
an outdated version not patcher to see

1467
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:42,080
if there is misconfiguration inside the

1468
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,120
tool and to close them

1469
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,280
so we should use

1470
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,800
this scanner and for that we have a good

1471
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,120
tool with his open bus

1472
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,560
which is

1473
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:58,159
his fork from a twitter let's say

1474
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:01,360
from the open source community upon 2008

1475
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,040
which is

1476
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,440
it's one of the best

1477
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:08,000
vulnerabilities but become fully

1478
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
commercial

1479
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,239
which is

1480
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,360
if you hear me better

1481
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,000
oh that sounds much better yes

1482
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,239
oh okay great

1483
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:51,799
i have two microphones

1484
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,159
so

1485
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:55,920
we are in separate

1486
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,840
best

1487
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,040
the high availability

1488
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,199
so those kinds of leftovers are very

1489
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:06,560
important to

1490
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,840
use to always scan your internal network

1491
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,840
and discover liability before a hacker

1492
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,800
do internal external sometimes it comes

1493
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,640
from training you bring

1494
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,320
you know inside your network there is

1495
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,679
always a challenge against the certain

1496
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:24,239
oh i succeeded to

1497
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:25,360
you know

1498
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,960
so we have to be very

1499
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,520
careful about that

1500
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,920
there is no concern and you are in

1501
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,239
charge and it means if nationally set of

1502
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:37,040
your own certified privacy search to

1503
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:40,000
scan your web server of course

1504
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,920
uh sometimes on the

1505
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,199
web server of your custody energy

1506
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:47,199
and for that we have very good tools

1507
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:50,320
also we have like two workings it's a

1508
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,760
very good web server scanner he

1509
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,080
tried to discover six thousand more than

1510
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,199
six thousand potential modules fly

1511
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:01,280
the file of program and check for

1512
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,120
updated version of

1513
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,800
services

1514
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,520
for a version specific problem of over

1515
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,199
2070

1516
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:10,400
server

1517
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,960
we have also another solution skipfish

1518
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,080
from google who can try to it's a

1519
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,880
dictionary based probe of your network

1520
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,800
you give you a map of

1521
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,000
your your web server and with annotation

1522
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,920
about the problem security problem

1523
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,480
existing needs and a lot of other tools

1524
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:32,320
vice web scrap web security powers and

1525
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,640
so on that permit you to

1526
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,199
test the vulnerability of your web

1527
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,920
servers of course your observer is the

1528
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:43,199
external uh you know eyes of your

1529
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:46,480
institution and it's very important to

1530
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:50,159
make them very secure and to

1531
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:53,120
close holds if they exist also for our

1532
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,679
community of national web servers

1533
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:58,239
sometimes to have a check of their level

1534
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:00,719
of security

1535
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:03,280
what we lose inside and for you it would

1536
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,800
be very easy to do it for the

1537
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,880
constitution that's one of the things

1538
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,199
that you have to think about while you

1539
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:12,320
search tools invest in learning such

1540
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,719
tools

1541
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,199
we have kali linux

1542
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:19,920
linux distribution live dvd

1543
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,480
which can with a graph more than 600

1544
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:23,760
tools

1545
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,460
open source tools around them and some

1546
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:28,719
[Music]

1547
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:31,120
other you know

1548
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,199
tools that you can use to

1549
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:37,120
script the very er evaluated scripts

1550
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:39,679
of vulnerability assessment of what you

1551
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:42,719
want a wireless

1552
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:44,080
network

1553
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,199
there is

1554
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:47,760
testing for our web for

1555
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,159
you know password attack sniffing

1556
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:53,120
reverse engineering all what you want

1557
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,719
is the group but then this carry

1558
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,880
distribution we can test those two one

1559
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,719
by one and see what's

1560
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:01,520
go to you and combine them in script

1561
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:05,440
complex script if you want to make more

1562
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,800
you know

1563
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,480
complex you know

1564
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,040
assessment

1565
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,040
about financing there is one six

1566
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,640
students and

1567
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,800
i mean at the end of training will show

1568
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,600
you some of the tools

1569
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,760
now concerning user access control also

1570
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,480
we have to put it

1571
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:27,360
outside network web access control when

1572
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,280
how people get out

1573
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,480
or better

1574
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,120
for that we can control

1575
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,520
and you have this extension of tweed

1576
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,120
which is a proxy

1577
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,360
squidward with permit also you are

1578
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:42,320
filtering if you want to control uh that

1579
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,480
people are productive and

1580
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:47,280
all actually excellent although only

1581
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:51,040
list of url or discard somewhere else

1582
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:53,199
i don't think to do that our guys have

1583
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:56,080
sometimes to know to see sport and so on

1584
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:56,960
but

1585
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,920
you have those if uh education entity

1586
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,840
and so on sometimes it's important to

1587
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,120
control

1588
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,120
web access to

1589
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:08,800
buy keywords or without just permitting

1590
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,800
execute link some sites that they go

1591
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,679
through you have only to install

1592
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:15,440
this proxy server

1593
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,719
on the

1594
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:18,800
proxy screens

1595
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,560
at least make it easier in fact to

1596
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,360
configure your firewall since if you put

1597
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,560
a proxy

1598
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,800
all access to internet have to go

1599
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,800
through that proxy so here it's easy to

1600
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,800
configure the firewall to pen anything

1601
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,520
that people go only to the proxy server

1602
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:34,880
and you when you're configuring the

1603
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,520
proxy server he can

1604
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:40,239
sorry his liability can get out

1605
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:43,840
and go to the internet and you reduce

1606
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:46,159
the surface of attack to this proxy

1607
01:20:46,159 --> 01:20:47,120
server

1608
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,840
lively strength with proxy server with

1609
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,920
host intelligent detection tool and so

1610
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,760
on and you will see it

1611
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,040
talk about web firewall and so on

1612
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,679
so you can also make single signal

1613
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:00,719
solution

1614
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:02,719
if you want to you know all know that

1615
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:05,040
people they have various passwords they

1616
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,600
put them and

1617
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,000
very visible in their desks

1618
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,320
so having only one password to access

1619
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:15,040
the values you know server and so on in

1620
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:17,520
the institution is better we have

1621
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,360
shipped off which is very good this is

1622
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,400
so too good to implement that they offer

1623
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,360
api also for your own application but

1624
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,960
they can do the same with

1625
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,800
university also provides very good

1626
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,960
social protocol for the kids application

1627
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,719
so you can also

1628
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:40,800
go to sso solution inside your

1629
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,280
institution step by step of course here

1630
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:45,520
we will show you the quality of tool the

1631
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,679
richness but of course

1632
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:49,520
and then when you start

1633
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,080
when you go you will see how easy

1634
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:55,719
and how far

1635
01:21:56,239 --> 01:21:58,719
about the virus on this farm that

1636
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:00,320
may be the uh

1637
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,679
only disadvantages but in open source

1638
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:05,760
there is one of the best antivirus

1639
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,280
engine which was acquired by cisco in

1640
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:11,120
2013 but still open source

1641
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,320
it's a very

1642
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,120
good antivirus engine which evaluates

1643
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,760
with cisco also and seed open source

1644
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,320
it's the basis of a lot of antivirus

1645
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,420
solutions

1646
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:25,550
[Music]

1647
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:30,760
[Music]

1648
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,719
you can implement customization site

1649
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:36,800
specific detection and remediation

1650
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:40,000
solution will is it back either bad i

1651
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,920
have always problem

1652
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,840
with the tools

1653
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,880
but the problem is we have also other

1654
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:49,840
solutions for workstation which

1655
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,120
most of the

1656
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:54,320
antivirus solutions are based on claim

1657
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,920
we're enjoying

1658
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,000
but those solutions only the problem

1659
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,760
that we have

1660
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:03,199
is sometimes a free work and sometimes

1661
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:06,320
they have less rich signature than

1662
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,760
commercial one

1663
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:11,199
of course financial solutions have big

1664
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:14,000
task force because what mean antivirus

1665
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,199
is to

1666
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:18,639
recall the maximum of fire signature but

1667
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:20,880
in real time every day

1668
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,800
and to update your

1669
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,520
anti-virus later device will update and

1670
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,639
discover the new discovered wires

1671
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:31,040
in open source there are not enough

1672
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:32,800
money to establish

1673
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,800
big task force

1674
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,600
but still they protect against the

1675
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,320
biggest wires from the biggest attack

1676
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:43,120
and believe me for commercial guys

1677
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,800
when you see the number of wires

1678
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,360
discovered every day

1679
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,639
that is the

1680
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:51,040
point of examination

1681
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,120
if it's not a way

1682
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,840
to continue to be the best

1683
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,040
and

1684
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,360
anyway i will not go to

1685
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,199
the other hypothesis

1686
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:03,520
the problem also they have no central

1687
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,920
administration for those tools

1688
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,400
so there is no limitation on open source

1689
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,560
solution

1690
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:13,040
still there we have you can have a

1691
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,360
commercial version free of charge for

1692
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:18,560
domestic use which are not also with no

1693
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,719
central administration but with fresh

1694
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:22,159
signature

1695
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:25,840
normally they'll not should be used for

1696
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,080
professional purpose

1697
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,400
only for domestic user

1698
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,638
but

1699
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:36,560
conservative spam the best that is

1700
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,679
uh are open source so spam is valuable

1701
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:42,400
known as used by a lot of isp

1702
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,719
for controlling spam and reducing spam

1703
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:46,239
there while sticking with transparent

1704
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:48,080
detection

1705
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,280
filtering

1706
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,199
further checks on basis all the

1707
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:53,600
techniques are implemented inside those

1708
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:58,800
tools you have to also hsp which and

1709
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,440
and so on that's not necessarily the

1710
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:17,040
best which is an image

1711
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,800
we have also tools for encryption of

1712
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,960
communication and also

1713
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:24,320
caption of storage on disks

1714
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,440
so

1715
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:29,679
you you know new parent cigar group pg

1716
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:30,880
what

1717
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,560
is the

1718
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,199
an opportunity the best can use

1719
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:37,840
and when you become research it's

1720
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,199
normally this is concerned emails you

1721
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:43,840
can encrypt email you can sign them that

1722
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,639
people also know the mail is coming from

1723
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:47,600
you

1724
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,560
and this is the mandatory for this here

1725
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:54,870
when we discuss with ourselves that i'd

1726
01:25:54,870 --> 01:26:01,030
[Music]

1727
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:10,320
the management of the certificate of the

1728
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,159
key of encryption

1729
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:14,400
for your image

1730
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,080
there is a version for

1731
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:19,520
windows window version of gpg for real

1732
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:22,400
which is also you can be used on

1733
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:25,199
the platform now a lot most of the tools

1734
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:28,400
you have also used on windows platform

1735
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:31,120
apart server now and staying linux

1736
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,120
because it's small reliable and somewhat

1737
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,159
clean

1738
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:36,400
at the forward station we have also

1739
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:40,400
working for rotation only

1740
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:42,560
this conception tool

1741
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:45,679
there is a lot to give you too but

1742
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:47,280
very clipped for example which is

1743
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:51,840
basically two cryptos very fast

1744
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,920
therapy tools now with

1745
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,560
up-to-date and very efficient who have

1746
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:11,600
also described unless we permit you to

1747
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,000
form you know

1748
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,239
confidential information to have them

1749
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:19,120
engaged on your disc so horrible concern

1750
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,600
investigation on incident and so on has

1751
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,360
to be followed

1752
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:26,480
to avoid any uh infringement to the

1753
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,639
confidentiality of

1754
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:32,920
declaration of people and

1755
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:46,520
but there is a solution also open vpn

1756
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:06,720
[Music]

1757
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:14,239
ssl you know vpn solution vpn solution

1758
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:15,600
means you will

1759
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,840
make you know tunnels but we knew

1760
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,280
another network

1761
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:22,000
and you permit also with clients

1762
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,760
your people if they

1763
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:28,080
will interact with you from outside

1764
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,000
you still sound very far like very very

1765
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,159
far

1766
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:57,159
keep talking test one two three

1767
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:59,760
it's better when you

1768
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,000
it goes in and out you start you start

1769
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,080
louder but then it fades

1770
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,159
i will start recording on his phone

1771
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:07,360
maybe

1772
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:11,239
maybe better okay

1773
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,280
all right thanks everybody for your

1774
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:24,280
patience

1775
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,800
that you can install at the level of

1776
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,760
the frontier of your network and you can

1777
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,320
give vpn clients you know to your people

1778
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:47,040
that they can

1779
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,280
another you know

1780
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:55,440
that again when they can

1781
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,239
have to enter your network they can

1782
01:29:58,239 --> 01:30:00,480
come

1783
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:03,760
to the vpn so there is no interception

1784
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:06,320
of their communication with your with

1785
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:09,440
your internal network

1786
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,239
so

1787
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:13,199
we have our solution ipsec ssl and we

1788
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:16,080
have vpn clients of course you all of

1789
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:20,120
you know ssh

1790
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:35,000
public web server

1791
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,440
it's a little bit better keep talking

1792
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,759
for me please

1793
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:02,639
you better hear me now

1794
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:05,760
yes we can hear you now

1795
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,639
i will try to keep my mouth only michael

1796
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:11,120
that's the only solution yeah technology

1797
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,120
thank you professor

1798
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:15,440
apologies for interrupting well it's a

1799
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:18,639
new pc and i suspect there is a new

1800
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:21,040
problem

1801
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:23,840
so the full protection of your web

1802
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,040
server

1803
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:27,120
you are not common

1804
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,600
i have not common web server it has to

1805
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,400
be very strongly protected as i told you

1806
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:35,600
hackers will try as a challenge to try

1807
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:36,850
to you know to

1808
01:31:36,850 --> 01:31:38,400
[Music]

1809
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,960
attack your your server all or your

1810
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,679
external you know resources and mainly

1811
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:45,199
the web server

1812
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:47,920
so for that

1813
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:50,159
now i have a problem with my powerpoint

1814
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:54,638
not with my micro nicer

1815
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:57,920
sorry really sorry for this logistic

1816
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:00,320
problem

1817
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:06,000
i have to cut let's come back to you

1818
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:10,760
oh

1819
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,639
so i will stay i don't know if you'll

1820
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:16,480

1821
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:19,520
is it okay oh let me return when when i

1822
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:22,800
come okay okay yeah this looks fine

1823
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,320
okay so i maybe go through that

1824
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,719
so now the protection of the c2 web

1825
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:30,000
server

1826
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,199
you have

1827
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:33,600
what you have to install but here i have

1828
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:35,600
an animation i have

1829
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,080
should be to come back to full screen

1830
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:40,560
because there is a little animation i

1831
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,000
don't know

1832
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,440
i haven't

1833
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,760
so sorry anyway

1834
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:48,800
what you do is to hide your web server

1835
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,760
his this is your web server

1836
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,760
but what you should do is not to expose

1837
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:56,560
it directly to the internet guys

1838
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:57,920
we put

1839
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,960
a reverse box in fact

1840
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,760
guys from outside enter this server with

1841
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,840
proxy and this syllabus proxy

1842
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:09,280
will and do you know

1843
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:12,000
contact the web server

1844
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
so we make you know

1845
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,719
as a distinction and we hide our

1846
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:20,480
observer from outside here we'll install

1847
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,320
what we call waff

1848
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:24,000
web firewall

1849
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,360
which

1850
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,920
it's like it needs in fact he

1851
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:30,320
screwed the content of

1852
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:33,280
http you know code and see if there is a

1853
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:35,360
tentative of attacks

1854
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:38,480
and he can stop them

1855
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:40,880
after that it came to reverse proxy to

1856
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:44,159
take if also go inside that only the

1857
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:48,000
proxy will contact the web server

1858
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:51,520
get the answer and give you the answer

1859
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:53,440
back to the clients

1860
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:55,280
so this is the way to strength your

1861
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,520
observer protection

1862
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:01,040
to be sure you have put frontiers and

1863
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,520
you have other frontiers that for

1864
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:06,000
intruder when they attack in fact they

1865
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,239
attack the reverse proxy and don't see

1866
01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:10,480
your observer and you can react and

1867
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:13,040
stress at that level

1868
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:15,120
so for that we have also very good

1869
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,520
solution from the open source

1870
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,840
mod security which

1871
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:22,239
a very good wife what because web

1872
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:23,520
firewall

1873
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:28,000
is the real-time backlash lookup he sees

1874
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,480
the tentative of hashtabular servers you

1875
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:31,679
know attack

1876
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:33,920
and generic one

1877
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:36,000
detects the error which comes from your

1878
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,480
observant hide them you can hide you

1879
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:41,119
know vulnerability of your observer that

1880
01:34:41,119 --> 01:34:42,159
layer

1881
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:44,000
male protected

1882
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,159
and the community offer you also consult

1883
01:34:46,159 --> 01:34:47,920
to trade with

1884
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:52,159
fe we can protect you better

1885
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:55,600
iron b is another sensor

1886
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,800
for real-time monitoring which is also a

1887
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,199
good tool but mouse security is more

1888
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:03,679
well known more users

1889
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:05,920
and you have various open source

1890
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:08,880
circuits for https based on various

1891
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:11,520
library for example mode ssl is

1892
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,199
based on

1893
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:13,600
lay analysis

1894
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:17,040
our library of encryption uh apache ssl

1895
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:19,280
is based on an open ssl library of

1896
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:21,600
encryption so value solution you have

1897
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,880
the choice

1898
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,760
to make the one more accommodate your

1899
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:29,520
needs or your belief

1900
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:32,719
we have also now for sensitive server we

1901
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:34,080
should install

1902
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:36,480
you know special operating system let's

1903
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:40,239
say secure operating system

1904
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:42,400
so for that we have value solution from

1905
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:45,920
the person's files like linux v server

1906
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,360
which permits

1907
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:49,199
that you isolate you know your

1908
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:51,520
environment if there is an attack on the

1909
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:55,440
process he can go and spread to all your

1910
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:58,400
it is contained in its zone

1911
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:01,520
so he better protect your server because

1912
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:04,159
you have various services some can be

1913
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:06,320
sensitive i can source of attack and two

1914
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:07,600
that can

1915
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:10,560
hack them but he cannot and make root

1916
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:13,600
kit to enter the whole system

1917
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,679
cube os is another solution it's not a

1918
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:18,320
mid-user system only but he is a late

1919
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,639
values environment permitting that an

1920
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:23,760
attack doesn't spread inside the server

1921
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:26,560
seo linux from nsa and at heart also

1922
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,639
support a very good

1923
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:30,960
system based also on monetary access

1924
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,800
control of dirt

1925
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:34,580
and but it's difficult to

1926
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:36,080
[Music]

1927
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:38,080
configure but the reaction of the open

1928
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:40,880
source community app armor which include

1929
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:43,119
the learning module permitted to easy

1930
01:36:43,119 --> 01:36:46,000
configured seo linux you know operating

1931
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,119
system so for sensitive server you

1932
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:52,320
should install those secure operating

1933
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:55,119
system and also as we said for the web

1934
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:57,040
server for example or what is in the

1935
01:36:57,040 --> 01:37:00,000
surface attack should be

1936
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,880
better protected against attack against

1937
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:06,440
expert attacks

1938
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:08,400
uh if there is platform you have the

1939
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:12,239
choice also not only vm you have uh type

1940
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:14,480
one impervious or type two you probably

1941
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:18,000
know virtualbox for example foreign open

1942
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:18,880
source

1943
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,679
run on virus you can install

1944
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:23,679
run on linux on

1945
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:25,520
window on mac

1946
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:28,280
and he can permit you to have uh

1947
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:31,119
celebration environments very easily

1948
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:33,119
then very well known he's an episode's

1949
01:37:33,119 --> 01:37:35,679
type one person this run directly on the

1950
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:37,360
horse's hardwoods

1951
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,440
and he permitted to have various senses

1952
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:41,119
of pelleting system

1953
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:42,320
and

1954
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,320
he's used it for example with amazon web

1955
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:48,080
services relax based hosting very zone

1956
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:49,520
as you see

1957
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:51,440
you know big institutions give

1958
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:53,520
confidence to open source products

1959
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,840
because they sense the interest of

1960
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:58,639
the system and the quality of them

1961
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:01,119
and they are also security

1962
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:03,920
because when we have the cod source open

1963
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,159
and seen i believe it's better than they

1964
01:38:06,159 --> 01:38:08,080
have as i told before

1965
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:10,239
be blind about what's going on inside

1966
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:12,960
the commercial you know closed

1967
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:16,280
source code

1968
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:19,440
so and much much more for the open

1969
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:20,400
source

1970
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,400
if you have need network attached

1971
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:25,440
storage or san we have open source

1972
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,560
solution

1973
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:27,520
uh

1974
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:28,719
offered

1975
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:30,560
so open by

1976
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:33,199
frinas for example and there is another

1977
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:35,440
commercial one but still full open

1978
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:36,639
source

1979
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:38,639
support thread

1980
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:40,320
just for letting the spirit of

1981
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:43,119
possibility in the open source community

1982
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:45,280
uh open filler

1983
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:47,520
when the author discovers that there is

1984
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:50,080
vulnerability there is hole in the

1985
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:51,280
products

1986
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:53,920
they by themselves publish that to

1987
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,520
people do not

1988
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,679
give confidence to their own tool you

1989
01:38:57,679 --> 01:38:58,639
know

1990
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:00,239
because that's just what you find in

1991
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:01,840
open source you'll never find the

1992
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:03,679
commercial tools of course

1993
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:05,440
due to the economic impact on the

1994
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:07,360
company but in open source you know

1995
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:09,360
those are philanthropic guys

1996
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,760
who try to make the best and when they

1997
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:14,320
discover they make error they don't

1998
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:17,119
hesitate to declare it to the community

1999
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:20,159
and the author in fact in 2013 say hey

2000
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:21,040
guys

2001
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:23,199
we have some holes that we cannot

2002
01:39:23,199 --> 01:39:24,560
remediate

2003
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,960
so please stop using our tools and

2004
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:29,719
development stopped fully in

2005
01:39:29,719 --> 01:39:32,480
2015. that's another example of the

2006
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,400
responsibility of the open source

2007
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,320
community

2008
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,239
if you need video control solution you

2009
01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:39,119
have

2010
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:40,719
i spy

2011
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:43,199
you know for pc zone mind that

2012
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:45,360
also can be used for large calculation

2013
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:48,000
and also integrate cctv

2014
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,920
you know unit if you want

2015
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,159
and of course security camera

2016
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:54,960
and with a very good

2017
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,679
graphic interface functionality and so

2018
01:39:57,679 --> 01:39:59,280
on

2019
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:02,480
as you see a lot a lot a lot of tools

2020
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,719
and you are not stopped by budget

2021
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:07,600
consonant you are stopped by heavy

2022
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:10,880
accusation procedure and so on

2023
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,560
it's only

2024
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:13,840
live to your

2025
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:16,159
creativity and believe me when you put

2026
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:18,000
your guys there and you put yourself

2027
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,840
there

2028
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:22,080
you so little interface the quality you

2029
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,000
know like

2030
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,239
playing you know

2031
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:28,719
what is more is now you are if you

2032
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:31,840
master those tools and this is uh

2033
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:34,719
you can deliver more seat service as i

2034
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:37,280
said before can provide immediate

2035
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:40,159
assistance for a consistency in rapidly

2036
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:41,280
deploying

2037
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:44,480
uh something like security architecture

2038
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,239
and selling them you know open source

2039
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:48,960
solution until if they want they can

2040
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,199
sell commercial products oh

2041
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:53,040
when they discover the beautiful this is

2042
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:54,719
those beautiful tools they will stay

2043
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:55,840
there

2044
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:58,480
they say there but please

2045
01:40:58,480 --> 01:41:02,560
don't go to offer training and assistant

2046
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:05,360
let it made by young private guys

2047
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:06,320
who

2048
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:10,159
will and then you create jobs you create

2049
01:41:10,159 --> 01:41:13,679
you know skills inside your country and

2050
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:15,199
uh

2051
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:18,000
let's step when people start making

2052
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
training open source and making

2053
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,480
assistance to users that install the

2054
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:25,199
console solution they can rapidly go

2055
01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:28,639
also to search and development activity

2056
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:29,679
easily

2057
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:31,679
by customizing for some

2058
01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:34,480
users by accompanying tools

2059
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:37,119
and they will go to really create new

2060
01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:38,639
tools

2061
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:41,360
so please leave that to the community to

2062
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:43,920
your young guys young engineers that

2063
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:47,280
they work but when you do it you install

2064
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:50,639
you open the market for them

2065
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:51,760
so

2066
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:54,239
i think we

2067
01:41:54,239 --> 01:41:56,159
we've finished it now

2068
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:58,080
concerning securing your internal

2069
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,520
architecture

2070
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:02,800
and we'll go a little bit to how to try

2071
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:06,239
it on our concerning cyberspace it will

2072
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:09,199
be fantastic for cecil guys national

2073
01:42:09,199 --> 01:42:12,719
associate guys but for all of you

2074
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:15,920
so how to install a monitoring system of

2075
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:19,040
cyberspace how those honeynut system

2076
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:23,360
and also artifact analysis labs

2077
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:25,760
concerning cyberspace monitoring system

2078
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:28,719
it's important for national assistance

2079
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:31,119
to not be blind in case of an attack is

2080
01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:34,000
going on on the national cyberspace so

2081
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,239
have to install your monitoring system

2082
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:39,199
to be immediately alerted if there is an

2083
01:42:39,199 --> 01:42:41,600
attack starting and going on in the

2084
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:44,159
cyberspace not inside now

2085
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:48,239
no more talking about the inside network

2086
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:49,520
and for that

2087
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:52,480
what can be done is to install

2088
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:54,159
you know agent

2089
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:56,880
to sell needs for example

2090
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:00,000
uh we'll see value solution going to

2091
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,440
complexity

2092
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,280
but here you come to

2093
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:06,480
corporate network you know your national

2094
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,600
computer center and so on all what

2095
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,360
sensitive or not sensitive corporate

2096
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:15,040
network we install atlanta frontier

2097
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,960
at the level of the external router

2098
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,639
let's say

2099
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:20,960
here the sensor when we can start

2100
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:23,520
solution

2101
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,600
intrusion detection tools

2102
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:26,719
are

2103
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:30,000
network monitoring tools in case of ddos

2104
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,920
and we connect them to secure connection

2105
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:34,719
to

2106
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:35,840
the

2107
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:38,639
associated sock

2108
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:40,719
so if an attack is going on on those

2109
01:43:40,719 --> 01:43:44,320
corporate network or telecom network

2110
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:48,080
uh operator network on the isp

2111
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:51,440
network we are immediately

2112
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:52,719
you know

2113
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:55,840
are alerted about that

2114
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:58,320
and we know that an attack a big mass

2115
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,239
attack of course

2116
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:02,639
those tools are not destinated to

2117
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:04,239
protect those

2118
01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:06,560
and you have to explain them it's just

2119
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:09,760
to have a monitoring tool when we detect

2120
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:12,480
mass attack it's not your job to protect

2121
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:13,280
them

2122
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:16,880
but your job to see if cyberspace is

2123
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:19,119
under attacks is in

2124
01:44:19,119 --> 01:44:21,840
bad situation

2125
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:24,480
so those server space monitoring system

2126
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:27,679
you can call them tsms briefly

2127
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:30,080
you have tools from

2128
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:31,600
the open source

2129
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:33,840
uh like snobby which is simple cyber

2130
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,760
sense monitoring system when you can

2131
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:37,040
install

2132
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:39,600
needs nips what you explain snot

2133
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,520
shuriket or sagan

2134
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:44,320
at the level of those frontier frontier

2135
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:45,360
of those

2136
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:47,760
you know sensitive network

2137
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:50,639
and immediately if an attack is going on

2138
01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:53,199
you can go and see what's going on

2139
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:54,639
inside

2140
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:57,280
the muti from your sock

2141
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:58,719
and respect

2142
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:00,960
if there is an attacks going on this is

2143
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:04,800
a very easy tool to install and to use

2144
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:08,639
another tools richer in fact

2145
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:10,639
is the security onion

2146
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:11,440
which

2147
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:14,800
install needs but install

2148
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,719
various open needs but

2149
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:20,239
in sem you know network security manager

2150
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:24,080
you can better see the dos attacks flow

2151
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,920
growing at the level of network so you

2152
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:28,800
will discover you have distributed ddos

2153
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:31,679
attack going on on your cyberspace

2154
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:35,199
he integrated a lot of tools that can

2155
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:39,040
permit you to not be blind of a case of

2156
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:43,199
an attack going on in your cyberspace

2157
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:44,400
mundo will

2158
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:45,600
show you

2159
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:48,880
uh this little tool but security onion

2160
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:50,080
in fact

2161
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:52,480
and we'll make a demo of that to show a

2162
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:53,520
little bit

2163
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:55,840
how easy it is to use those kind of

2164
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:59,679
tools mondo i use that okay

2165
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:02,159
thank you i will stop

2166
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:04,400
okay

2167
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,440
i will just uh

2168
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:10,800
start with the presentation of sehar mr

2169
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:13,800
nabil

2170
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,520
yes okay okay

2171
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:27,679
i will shave myself and then we'll make

2172
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:29,520
a demo of her

2173
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:31,360
so we make demons

2174
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:32,560
but that's

2175
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:36,639
to show the guys how easy is how easy

2176
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:39,960
they quality

2177
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:42,800
so first of all i will show you uh

2178
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:45,440
which is a cyber threat

2179
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:48,560
monitoring system which is developed by

2180
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:49,840
our

2181
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,840
azac team information sharing and

2182
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:56,080
analysis team and which is based on uh

2183
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:58,960
so open source tools here the first

2184
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:02,000
interface is the single sign-on

2185
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,960
lemon ldap solution which is

2186
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:07,600
open source

2187
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:11,360
after log into the interface we have

2188
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:15,440
all uh tools we we can see here

2189
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:18,000
the dashboard the threat intelligence

2190
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,520
tools

2191
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:23,040
the resources the common resources

2192
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:25,840
the sensor monitoring

2193
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:29,040
which is implemented on the isp the

2194
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:31,440
internet service provider and

2195
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:32,400
the

2196
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:35,600
operator telecom

2197
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,840
we can choose the seller ip manager

2198
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:40,880
which is the local who is for the

2199
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:43,040
national agency for computer security or

2200
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:46,000
for to insert

2201
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,560
here are all the ip

2202
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:51,520
range of our cyberspace it's very

2203
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:52,960
important

2204
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:56,159
here are the dashboard of vulnerability

2205
01:47:56,159 --> 01:47:59,520
detected and declared for

2206
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:01,840
for our partners

2207
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:04,400
there is also a dashboard for

2208
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:07,199
vulnerability related to the critical

2209
01:48:07,199 --> 01:48:09,920
infrastructure information protection

2210
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:12,800
the cni or the the critical national

2211
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:14,639
infrastructure

2212
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:17,199
we can see all vulnerability

2213
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:20,000
categorized by

2214
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,199
ip or by sector

2215
01:48:23,199 --> 01:48:26,960
we can see here also zabix which is

2216
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:31,719
used for passive monitoring

2217
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:39,840
here we can put all the website or

2218
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:44,239
our government website on our space to

2219
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:48,159
to to detect the availability of this

2220
01:48:48,159 --> 01:48:49,600
website

2221
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:52,239
there is also cyber chef there is also

2222
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:53,760
the attack

2223
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:56,480
navigator which implement the tactic

2224
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:58,000
techniques and the procedure of the

2225
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,679
threat actors

2226
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:02,480
the high for case management

2227
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:04,880
there is also a misp the malware

2228
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:06,639
information sharing

2229
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:08,719
threat platform

2230
01:49:08,719 --> 01:49:11,360
there is also the common resources

2231
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:13,679
here the internet and the next cloud

2232
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:14,960
which is

2233
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:17,119
an open source to uh

2234
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:18,800
to to share

2235
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:22,080
the document between uh cesar team and

2236
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:24,320
the circ and the isaac team

2237
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:28,639
and there is also a services for who is

2238
01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:33,520
we just need to put the ip here and show

2239
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:36,560
the the the isp of this ip

2240
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:40,800
there is here the matter most for

2241
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:44,320
chat and now i will show you the and the

2242
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,560
graphical user interface of security

2243
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:47,840
onion

2244
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:49,040
it's uh

2245
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:53,199
contains uh multiple tools like kibana

2246
01:49:53,199 --> 01:49:56,480
for dashboard grafana also cyber chef

2247
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:59,599
we can create a playbook for

2248
01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:02,960
a multiple uh type of attacks we can

2249
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:06,560
we he it implements also the hive and

2250
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:09,199
the attack navigator

2251
01:50:09,199 --> 01:50:12,960
uh this is just an example of uh sensor

2252
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:15,280
security onion and

2253
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:16,480
here we see

2254
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:19,280
the alerts generated when

2255
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:22,239
uh the attack or when we have

2256
01:50:22,239 --> 01:50:25,440
an attack on our networks it implements

2257
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:28,800
a lot of tools like suricata like

2258
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:31,840
eds host intrusion detection system

2259
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:33,280
ossec

2260
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:34,080
and

2261
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:37,040
so i will stop here to not unpack the

2262
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:39,920
time of my colleagues and uh we can

2263
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:42,960
assist you later or in the the next

2264
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:44,960
workshop in the next

2265
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:45,920
week

2266
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:46,800
to

2267
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:47,760
uh

2268
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:51,599
to to implement this free framework and

2269
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:52,960
to implement

2270
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:55,920
all these open source tools

2271
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:57,840
so thank you and

2272
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:01,520
mr nabil the floor is yours

2273
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:04,840
thank

2274
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:08,239
you we can go if you want to post

2275
01:51:08,239 --> 01:51:10,880
question please raise your hand

2276
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:12,719
or we can

2277
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:14,800
make us

2278
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:18,320
before the i don't know when you

2279
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:22,239
left two hours when we maybe let you

2280
01:51:22,239 --> 01:51:25,440
rest a little bit for how much time but

2281
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:28,080
i've just finished this part

2282
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:30,639
and then we can maybe make a break

2283
01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:33,199
if you want

2284
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:36,560
so but not hesitate to

2285
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:38,880
raise your hand in case you need to have

2286
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:42,719
questions or just send them by the qr

2287
01:51:42,719 --> 01:51:44,800
und you know

2288
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:46,400
tools

2289
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:47,360
so

2290
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:49,839
like

2291
01:51:50,239 --> 01:51:53,040
other problems from uh sorry i don't

2292
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,280
know

2293
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:58,840
stuff

2294
01:52:13,199 --> 01:52:14,880
sorry for that

2295
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:19,280
i'll take my mic on my mouse again

2296
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:25,040
let's microsoft then

2297
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:32,239
so what explain it a little bit uh

2298
01:52:32,239 --> 01:52:33,599
munder and

2299
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:34,639
sarah

2300
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:36,719
is the thinset system for monitoring

2301
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:38,880
cyber space security for tunisian cyber

2302
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,000
space

2303
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,880
it's cms tools but which integrates also

2304
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:46,480
collaboration of incident log

2305
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,800
to permit automatic alert in case there

2306
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:50,719
is an attack going on

2307
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:52,719
but with onion you have to go you know

2308
01:52:52,719 --> 01:52:55,520
from sensor to sensor and see what's in

2309
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:58,080
going on what we need is the system that

2310
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:59,440
correlates

2311
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:01,840
what's going on around the various

2312
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:03,679
sensor and

2313
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:05,040
adding other

2314
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:06,560
fat you know

2315
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,840
formation

2316
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:10,880
sources to try to automatically alert

2317
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:12,960
the

2318
01:53:17,599 --> 01:53:18,639
there is

2319
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:21,280
an attack a big attack must attack going

2320
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:23,199
on starting

2321
01:53:23,199 --> 01:53:26,400
he also has explained rapidly mondo

2322
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,719
integrate feeds from other

2323
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:30,560
natural international heat intelligence

2324
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:32,880
platform and honey net system the

2325
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:35,599
national honey led system but other

2326
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:39,040
also owning its system from france

2327
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:41,679
so it's important there is correlation

2328
01:53:41,679 --> 01:53:44,000
between various models of sahara which

2329
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:44,719
says

2330
01:53:44,719 --> 01:53:47,040
which control the web web defacement and

2331
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:49,760
so on and automatically will alert if

2332
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:52,639
there is a defacement uh or tentative of

2333
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:54,480
defacement for observer

2334
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:55,679
also the

2335
01:53:55,679 --> 01:53:57,679
important you know

2336
01:53:57,679 --> 01:54:00,719
internet infrastructure server dns and

2337
01:54:00,719 --> 01:54:03,040
so on

2338
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:05,360
sorry

2339
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:09,679
i'm not kidding you

2340
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:11,599
i'm not hitting you now i have a problem

2341
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:14,000
of uh

2342
01:54:14,159 --> 01:54:15,840
go ahead

2343
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:17,040
it's okay

2344
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:19,040
okay okay thanks

2345
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:20,239
so uh

2346
01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:22,800
the senses that we say in the honey nets

2347
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:25,920
try to make correlation and to

2348
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,760
alert

2349
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:31,199
so sehha is installed at the level of

2350
01:54:31,199 --> 01:54:34,480
you know some pcm but a little powerful

2351
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:36,560
depending on the size of the network

2352
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:38,639
that we are supervising

2353
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:40,800
and he

2354
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:43,679
see what's going on

2355
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:47,760
trace of you know tentative of intuition

2356
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,040
by the

2357
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:51,040
ids but it needs

2358
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:54,480
all flow going up meaning the dos attack

2359
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:57,280
is going on and other little

2360
01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:00,480
things and we he send them automatically

2361
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:03,440
to the stock to the server their server

2362
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:05,679
attuned cert

2363
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:09,040
so as we said values we

2364
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:11,040
can take from the community also left

2365
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:13,760
coming on and from

2366
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:16,320
our system of internal supervision of

2367
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:18,080
the cyberspace

2368
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:21,119
and correlate them and try to

2369
01:55:21,119 --> 01:55:23,840
put it to the incident team and to

2370
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:26,239
automatically alert farmers attack on

2371
01:55:26,239 --> 01:55:28,639
the tunisian cyberspace

2372
01:55:28,639 --> 01:55:31,040
so we have situational ones about what's

2373
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:34,159
going on inside our cyberspace and it's

2374
01:55:34,159 --> 01:55:36,480
very important for you if especially if

2375
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:38,239
you're of course if you are a national

2376
01:55:38,239 --> 01:55:40,719
associate to implement this kind of

2377
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:43,840
thing do not be blind of thing going on

2378
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:47,199
on your cyberspace

2379
01:55:47,199 --> 01:55:50,638
so various has explained that

2380
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:53,599
from zone 8 from team camaro from fish

2381
01:55:53,599 --> 01:55:54,639
tank

2382
01:55:54,639 --> 01:55:56,880
from other honey net project shadow

2383
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:59,360
server and so on that we try to be

2384
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:01,280
informed what's going on at the

2385
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:04,960
international level also

2386
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:09,199
class demo was made a little bit by

2387
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:13,280
mondo anyway we can as i told you and

2388
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:16,080
make special demo of the system in

2389
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:18,239
special training you know session if you

2390
01:56:18,239 --> 01:56:20,639
want if you are interested

2391
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:22,639
well now concerning honey net and false

2392
01:56:22,639 --> 01:56:23,840
future

2393
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:26,719
honey net we permit you to

2394
01:56:26,719 --> 01:56:30,880
not to try to capture sample of threats

2395
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:34,080
bots or play lots and so on

2396
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:36,639
in your cyberspace

2397
01:56:36,639 --> 01:56:37,920
it's not

2398
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:41,199
a cm sms it's not a system for

2399
01:56:41,199 --> 01:56:45,199
monitoring security of a cyberspace

2400
01:56:45,199 --> 01:56:48,560
because it will only at the capture you

2401
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:49,679
know

2402
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:52,480
a threat but it doesn't give you a good

2403
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:54,800
vision of what's going on

2404
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:57,040
on your cyberspace

2405
01:56:57,040 --> 01:56:59,520
for example ddos attack you can never

2406
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:01,920
sell them with honey net infrastructure

2407
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:03,119
some people

2408
01:57:03,119 --> 01:57:05,360
pretend that honey net permits

2409
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:06,880
supervision of the security of

2410
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:08,159
cyberspace

2411
01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:11,760
believe me it's not and don't do this

2412
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:13,199
this year

2413
01:57:13,199 --> 01:57:16,320
but as you saw a very simple tool to

2414
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:18,639
make it easier for you to supervise

2415
01:57:18,639 --> 01:57:21,760
the security of your cyberspace

2416
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:24,080
so honey network the net only that in

2417
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:26,639
fact we'll emulate virtual

2418
01:57:26,639 --> 01:57:28,960
virtual vulnerable machine and service

2419
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:31,119
stone network

2420
01:57:31,119 --> 01:57:32,159
normally

2421
01:57:32,159 --> 01:57:35,360
you should put it in a related network

2422
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:39,040
don't please put it like that don't put

2423
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:41,360
it on your firewall connected to your

2424
01:57:41,360 --> 01:57:45,440
influx because honeynet as their name is

2425
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:49,199
honey net they attract also attacks from

2426
01:57:49,199 --> 01:57:51,040
hackers

2427
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:54,400
and a lot of hackers when they saw that

2428
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:57,119
there is whole they can use

2429
01:57:57,119 --> 01:57:59,440
to know and to use themselves inside

2430
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:01,920
your network

2431
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:03,599
going through the honey nets it's

2432
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:06,960
preferable to make it an israelite

2433
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:08,639
network

2434
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:10,960
and not with your

2435
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:13,760
space of ip address

2436
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:16,320
that you don't put them into challenge

2437
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:18,560
and normally you should

2438
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:20,800
in any country you have dirty ip address

2439
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:22,960
ap address of people with numbers well

2440
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:25,840
protected or there is a big infection of

2441
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:28,159
form and so on and so on

2442
01:58:28,159 --> 01:58:30,880
and normally they are well known and you

2443
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:32,080
have to

2444
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:35,520
manage those to attract the most of

2445
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:38,560
let's say kind of violence or form of

2446
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:40,880
bots of scripts

2447
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:42,560
and to try to

2448
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:44,400
discover it's a

2449
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:47,360
good tool in fact also for

2450
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:49,360
let's say the confidence of your

2451
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:51,360
constituency

2452
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:54,400
when you discover both in an institution

2453
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:57,360
and you tell them we discovered this but

2454
01:58:57,360 --> 01:59:00,840
oh those guys have good you know

2455
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:04,400
uh level of security and they're helping

2456
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:06,560
us sometimes it's a way of marketing of

2457
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:07,360
the

2458
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:09,040
ccs

2459
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:11,119
and of course you discover those kind of

2460
01:59:11,119 --> 01:59:14,880
form of skeletons who are

2461
01:59:15,119 --> 01:59:17,440
in your cyberspace not are that's a

2462
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:19,520
problem but

2463
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:21,599
the less you discover the better you are

2464
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:23,119
and you better can inform your

2465
01:59:23,119 --> 01:59:25,760
constitution if they are infected by

2466
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:29,360
specific birds especially

2467
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:31,599
so for that to have value solution low

2468
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:33,840
interaction honey in that system or high

2469
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:36,159
intellectual net system so for this

2470
01:59:36,159 --> 01:59:39,040
received better the slow interaction on

2471
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:40,800
a net cell but it's a disputed

2472
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:41,920
intelligent

2473
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:44,239
detection system in fact it's client

2474
01:59:44,239 --> 01:59:47,280
server pro surface net ids

2475
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:49,679
which permit you to little bit uh

2476
01:59:49,679 --> 01:59:50,960
monitor

2477
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:53,760
your honey net in a very efficient way

2478
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:56,719
and see a very good open source solution

2479
01:59:56,719 --> 02:00:00,000
easy to to

2480
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:04,000
to install and to manage

2481
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,480
we have a lot of uh because honeynet

2482
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:08,800
what mean we we put

2483
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:10,400
you know

2484
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:13,840
tools for smttp for example can analyze

2485
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:16,719
malicious email others will try to log

2486
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:18,960
brute force attack

2487
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:21,599
or although it will try a little bit to

2488
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:24,320
emulate vulnerability and try to capture

2489
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:26,960
warm

2490
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:29,360
others specialize in the web application

2491
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:32,639
all those can be installed on the honey

2492
02:00:32,639 --> 02:00:34,000
net surface net

2493
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,360
[Music]

2494
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:37,199
the honey net system

2495
02:00:37,199 --> 02:00:40,080
and much more you know kids from all of

2496
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:42,560
those are from the south

2497
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:45,199
the open source community

2498
02:00:45,199 --> 02:00:47,598
field

2499
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:48,880
you can

2500
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:51,199
go to high intellectual honeypot

2501
02:00:51,199 --> 02:00:53,840
herniates this is if you are interested

2502
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:55,920
a little bit to make you know a

2503
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:59,119
supervision of active attack

2504
02:00:59,119 --> 02:00:59,920
it's

2505
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:02,159
you have more interaction with attack

2506
02:01:02,159 --> 02:01:04,719
and you can try to capture

2507
02:01:04,719 --> 02:01:08,880
its activity and if it's not

2508
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:10,320
always no

2509
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:12,719
much mother time not feasible to the

2510
02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:13,920
trace

2511
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:16,400
from where he is trying to attack as you

2512
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:18,320
know attacker does not attack you

2513
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:20,560
directly from the pc

2514
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:22,560
they will go through various proxy to

2515
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:24,560
hide their origin

2516
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:26,080
but

2517
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:29,119
if you with this interaction you can

2518
02:01:29,119 --> 02:01:31,440
have time a little bit to try to

2519
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:33,119
try to retrace

2520
02:01:33,119 --> 02:01:35,520
but not easy

2521
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:38,239
so have various solution uh

2522
02:01:38,239 --> 02:01:40,960
and you can install so any net uh for

2523
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:44,400
your cyberspace low interaction in fact

2524
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:48,719
uh solution is better self ideas

2525
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:50,719
you can install also an artifact

2526
02:01:50,719 --> 02:01:53,119
analysis laboratory if you

2527
02:01:53,119 --> 02:01:55,760
you need to first you have to start low

2528
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:58,800
but step by step you will be interested

2529
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:01,599
to capture via the honey net if you

2530
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:03,360
capture

2531
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:05,199
artifacts that in fact mean malicious

2532
02:02:05,199 --> 02:02:06,880
code war

2533
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:09,199
or script of attacks

2534
02:02:09,199 --> 02:02:13,040
you can after that make analysis

2535
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:14,960
start doing that

2536
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:17,280
this is important for very critical

2537
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:20,560
national you know network or application

2538
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:22,320
because those network all those

2539
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:25,599
applications would be attacked by very

2540
02:02:25,599 --> 02:02:27,360
skilled

2541
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:28,560
people

2542
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:30,400
and not

2543
02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:32,719
people army in fact as you know now we

2544
02:02:32,719 --> 02:02:35,440
are at the time of uh

2545
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:36,800
civil war

2546
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:39,520
and any army in the world has now its

2547
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:40,480
team

2548
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:44,320
the apt famous apt teams russia and so

2549
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:45,599
on

2550
02:02:45,599 --> 02:02:47,280
and for critical

2551
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:48,480
you know

2552
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:52,080
network confirmation system they can try

2553
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:56,080
to introduce that for espionage or for

2554
02:02:56,080 --> 02:02:58,719
also when needed sabotage

2555
02:02:58,719 --> 02:03:01,679
so sometimes step by step you have to go

2556
02:03:01,679 --> 02:03:05,440
to artifact analysis make it as a joke

2557
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:08,719
first and step by step people can go to

2558
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:11,280
there and reverse engineering and such

2559
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:13,840
kind of little bit heavy

2560
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:15,199
activity

2561
02:03:15,199 --> 02:03:17,840
but mainly it requires collaboration

2562
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:20,320
from editor of software

2563
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:21,679
which as

2564
02:03:21,679 --> 02:03:22,800
for our

2565
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:26,159
country is more difficult than

2566
02:03:26,159 --> 02:03:28,960
it will be in the u.s or in france or

2567
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:30,560
things when they have good relations

2568
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:33,360
with software editor to discover zero

2569
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:34,480
day

2570
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:37,360
if there any you know problem in their

2571
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:41,280
solution not yet declare it for example

2572
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:44,320
but you can start doing that with tools

2573
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:47,520
like cuckoo which permit you to make

2574
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:49,679
sandbox to put

2575
02:03:49,679 --> 02:03:50,719
what you

2576
02:03:50,719 --> 02:03:52,960
captured from honeynet

2577
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:55,520
and you put it like inside the lab and

2578
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:57,280
you can see to understand how the

2579
02:03:57,280 --> 02:03:59,360
artifact operates

2580
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:00,239
uh

2581
02:04:00,239 --> 02:04:02,960
what he called his undo ip what copy of

2582
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:05,360
file he create or delete from your file

2583
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:08,639
system make a damp of a memory so you

2584
02:04:08,639 --> 02:04:11,679
will discover a little bit uh

2585
02:04:11,679 --> 02:04:13,920
the techniques used by the artifact by

2586
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:17,280
the malicious code and artifacts and

2587
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:20,000
what is his goal of motivation because a

2588
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,840
lot of artifact doesn't react or act

2589
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:25,199
immediately especially if they are

2590
02:04:25,199 --> 02:04:26,560
destinated

2591
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:29,920
to you know operate sabotage

2592
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:32,960
it will be done at the instant t

2593
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:34,159
when

2594
02:04:34,159 --> 02:04:36,840
they who installed them will give the

2595
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:39,599
order and i don't know if you heard but

2596
02:04:39,599 --> 02:04:41,280
a lot of things that happened around the

2597
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:42,239
world

2598
02:04:42,239 --> 02:04:45,280
and we have very critical things that

2599
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:48,560
happened in some critical infrastructure

2600
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:49,760
now we are

2601
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:52,400
talking about nuclear cyber

2602
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:53,599
bomb

2603
02:04:53,599 --> 02:04:56,239
what was discovered recently in arab

2604
02:04:56,239 --> 02:04:59,599
saudia is they were able

2605
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:01,599
to really

2606
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:04,840
make you know human

2607
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:06,880
loss and

2608
02:05:06,880 --> 02:05:08,960
maybe uh

2609
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:12,000
thousands of life can be lost because

2610
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,679
they enter the

2611
02:05:13,679 --> 02:05:15,040
chemical

2612
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:17,119
flux

2613
02:05:17,119 --> 02:05:18,239
factory

2614
02:05:18,239 --> 02:05:22,560
and they disable all system that can be

2615
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:24,960
activated in case there was a problem in

2616
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:25,679
the

2617
02:05:25,679 --> 02:05:30,239
uh inside the factory and so if some

2618
02:05:30,239 --> 02:05:32,880
they were able also to make this

2619
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:35,440
incident and

2620
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:36,560
like

2621
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:40,079
the guys will not be able to stop it

2622
02:05:40,079 --> 02:05:41,760
so as it happened in india as you

2623
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:44,480
remember you know there will be chemical

2624
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:46,560
stuff going on

2625
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:50,560
and people can be can die with that

2626
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:53,760
so sometimes we now we are in an era

2627
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:56,480
which is cyber security become very very

2628
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:58,480
critical very sensitive on national

2629
02:05:58,480 --> 02:06:01,360
security and

2630
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:03,599
the artifact the malicious code they

2631
02:06:03,599 --> 02:06:06,719
will use for those kind of activity are

2632
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:09,040
not discovered by any antivirus of

2633
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:10,719
course

2634
02:06:10,719 --> 02:06:12,960
so a little bit to have

2635
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:16,719
skills starting and protecting very

2636
02:06:16,719 --> 02:06:19,599
critical you know process

2637
02:06:19,599 --> 02:06:21,679
information system or

2638
02:06:21,679 --> 02:06:24,480
especially critical infrastructure

2639
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:26,960
the company of electricity the company

2640
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:29,040
because an attack when he

2641
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:31,199
go to the company or electricity you

2642
02:06:31,199 --> 02:06:34,320
know and our country can we have social

2643
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:37,280
you know participation can happen behind

2644
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:40,320
and so on and so on

2645
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:42,239
so to start a little bit you have

2646
02:06:42,239 --> 02:06:45,920
various tools there are wine

2647
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:48,800
all of them ascend mercedes you put the

2648
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:51,679
artifact the malicious cause inside box

2649
02:06:51,679 --> 02:06:54,239
and you can analyze what he's tried to

2650
02:06:54,239 --> 02:06:57,119
do what he do make trace of that

2651
02:06:57,119 --> 02:06:59,119
and what

2652
02:06:59,119 --> 02:07:01,440
is intent and what is

2653
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:03,679
let's say capacity here it has to

2654
02:07:03,679 --> 02:07:06,400
coupled by reverse engineering which

2655
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:07,679
requests

2656
02:07:07,679 --> 02:07:10,320
more time and more skills but can be

2657
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:13,280
done you can specialize one of two guys

2658
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:16,239
to go further to that and to be able to

2659
02:07:16,239 --> 02:07:17,679
make also

2660
02:07:17,679 --> 02:07:19,840
reverse engineering and

2661
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:23,280
have the code back and seal really what

2662
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:25,840
is inside the malicious gods

2663
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:28,719
as i told you

2664
02:07:28,719 --> 02:07:30,079
bad

2665
02:07:30,079 --> 02:07:31,760
things will happen when they are

2666
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:34,000
activated

2667
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:37,599
by remotely or by you know cover channel

2668
02:07:37,599 --> 02:07:39,599
there's various techniques

2669
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:42,639
very difficult to discover and to stop

2670
02:07:42,639 --> 02:07:45,840
so to start not bad

2671
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:48,000
you can also by yourself

2672
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,400
try to improve your skills in creating

2673
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:52,159
and

2674
02:07:52,159 --> 02:07:54,960
exploit yourself there is meet exploit

2675
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:56,880
which communities is the opposite

2676
02:07:56,880 --> 02:07:58,560
framework of

2677
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:00,639
metasploit there is a commercial version

2678
02:08:00,639 --> 02:08:02,880
but there is community version which is

2679
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:04,159
comparable

2680
02:08:04,159 --> 02:08:05,760
there is some

2681
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:08,079
add-on in the commercial one the open

2682
02:08:08,079 --> 02:08:12,000
core in fact not really commercial

2683
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,480
and they permit you to

2684
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:15,599
write

2685
02:08:15,599 --> 02:08:18,400
script of exploit to test them

2686
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:22,000
and to be able to also understand the

2687
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,560
other side bedside how they are doing

2688
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:26,480
also

2689
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:29,199
it's it's a way there is open source for

2690
02:08:29,199 --> 02:08:30,480
that

2691
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:32,880
so now i'm we may be if you want to make

2692
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:34,320
a break

2693
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:35,440
for you

2694
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:37,920
uh because going now we will go how to

2695
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:39,440
implement

2696
02:08:39,440 --> 02:08:41,360
your information system will open this

2697
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:44,320
tool how you generate your mailing list

2698
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:47,599
you know security mailing list easily

2699
02:08:47,599 --> 02:08:49,599
mabulou could show you that

2700
02:08:49,599 --> 02:08:52,079
and after that how you do foreign six

2701
02:08:52,079 --> 02:08:54,639
investigation and foreign six

2702
02:08:54,639 --> 02:08:56,480
activity

2703
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:57,760
but first

2704
02:08:57,760 --> 02:08:59,599
see the system that you have started to

2705
02:08:59,599 --> 02:09:02,560
make your job easier ticketing system

2706
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:05,599
and the system for generating the

2707
02:09:05,599 --> 02:09:07,520
the mailing lists

2708
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:09,920
last

2709
02:09:10,719 --> 02:09:12,719
i mean we'll show you

2710
02:09:12,719 --> 02:09:14,239
how

2711
02:09:14,239 --> 02:09:16,960
tools to how to investigate and make

2712
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:19,119
foreign sticks easily with open source

2713
02:09:19,119 --> 02:09:20,800
solution

2714
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:24,239
implementing now information system

2715
02:09:24,239 --> 02:09:26,719
and there first of all there is the

2716
02:09:26,719 --> 02:09:29,280
incident handling process so you have to

2717
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:30,239
install

2718
02:09:30,239 --> 02:09:33,679
an incident tracking system

2719
02:09:33,679 --> 02:09:37,119
what is called its which will permit you

2720
02:09:37,119 --> 02:09:38,560
to handle

2721
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:42,000
all the declaration of you know incident

2722
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,480
and to put them into

2723
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:48,000
a clear you know process

2724
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,719
which is the process in fact that is

2725
02:09:50,719 --> 02:09:53,440
requested if you want as the cecil to be

2726
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:54,800
in first

2727
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:56,639
people will come audit if you are

2728
02:09:56,639 --> 02:09:59,760
expecting a little bit the process of

2729
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:02,159
incident handling those kind of system

2730
02:10:02,159 --> 02:10:05,119
will permit you to put them into

2731
02:10:05,119 --> 02:10:07,119
action easily

2732
02:10:07,119 --> 02:10:08,480
and

2733
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:10,639
for that there is values tool

2734
02:10:10,639 --> 02:10:12,960
handling will present jlp waiting for

2735
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:14,800
him there is a demo

2736
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:17,679
there is for example earth tier

2737
02:10:17,679 --> 02:10:19,280
which is a

2738
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:22,079
an open source its make

2739
02:10:22,079 --> 02:10:25,760
purposely for cesius

2740
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:28,800
you can use it if by

2741
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:31,840
tfc search he process the

2742
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:34,239
he implements the process of incentive

2743
02:10:34,239 --> 02:10:36,159
handling

2744
02:10:36,159 --> 02:10:37,599
well

2745
02:10:37,599 --> 02:10:39,520
people you know

2746
02:10:39,520 --> 02:10:42,159
this very interesting characteristic but

2747
02:10:42,159 --> 02:10:43,760
i don't know

2748
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:44,960
why people

2749
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:46,159
more

2750
02:10:46,159 --> 02:10:48,400
use otrs

2751
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:49,440
which is

2752
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:51,679
the community edition

2753
02:10:51,679 --> 02:10:55,239
they are more rich

2754
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:15,440
so

2755
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:17,840
there is value sticking system that

2756
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:19,119
exists

2757
02:11:19,119 --> 02:11:21,679
and you know it's uh

2758
02:11:21,679 --> 02:11:24,079
of management offenses whatever they are

2759
02:11:24,079 --> 02:11:26,000
that jpe

2760
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,480
is

2761
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:31,920
they use a clean certain amended version

2762
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:33,840
so it's a normally system for

2763
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:35,840
informational cells it's an

2764
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:39,360
informational service manager it's ideal

2765
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:41,040
compliant

2766
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:43,119
there is a lot of rich functionality for

2767
02:11:43,119 --> 02:11:45,440
incident handling management and

2768
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:48,239
especially for technical also knowledge

2769
02:11:48,239 --> 02:11:50,159
sharing is very important at the south

2770
02:11:50,159 --> 02:11:53,040
of ccir that people share you know they

2771
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:55,920
experienced what they did

2772
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:57,040
when

2773
02:11:57,040 --> 02:11:59,760
they handle incidents and this

2774
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:02,360
make more interaction between the

2775
02:12:02,360 --> 02:12:03,679
[Music]

2776
02:12:03,679 --> 02:12:06,000
staff of the siciert and the arrangement

2777
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,400
of their knowledge of their skills

2778
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:11,280
there is a good knowledge base sharing

2779
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:14,079
inside jlp that permit that

2780
02:12:14,079 --> 02:12:15,840
of course there is ticket to what you

2781
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:17,520
call ticket when you have an incident

2782
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:20,239
you have to create a ticket to follow

2783
02:12:20,239 --> 02:12:23,199
the incident all the phases by which the

2784
02:12:23,199 --> 02:12:25,119
incident go through

2785
02:12:25,119 --> 02:12:27,280
this can be made automatically also by a

2786
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:29,760
male if you have the city mail you know

2787
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:32,400
that people can declare incidents

2788
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:35,280
glp can automatically feed them inside

2789
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:36,480
the system

2790
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:38,880
and then they'll be handled by first guy

2791
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:42,800
who see what if it's a serious incident

2792
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:45,280
then he would decide to affect it to a t

2793
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:47,520
a member of the team of fancy tentending

2794
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:49,040
and to follow up

2795
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:51,760
what's going on through the incidental

2796
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:53,119
resolution

2797
02:12:53,119 --> 02:12:55,360
so about stick tick system permit to

2798
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:58,000
handle a lot of incident in the most

2799
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:59,520
smooth way

2800
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:01,599
and make it like

2801
02:13:01,599 --> 02:13:03,679
say tracking of the incident report a

2802
02:13:03,679 --> 02:13:06,000
sentiment of incident 10 degrees of

2803
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,440
validation

2804
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:10,159
and send email of response to the client

2805
02:13:10,159 --> 02:13:12,000
to the current situation about what is

2806
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:13,199
going on

2807
02:13:13,199 --> 02:13:16,560
requesting from them in a secure way

2808
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:18,480
so it's very important for the incident

2809
02:13:18,480 --> 02:13:20,960
handling team to have such system

2810
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:24,800
and to implement the good process of

2811
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:27,280
processing of an incident of treatment

2812
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:30,239
of an ancient by its various face

2813
02:13:30,239 --> 02:13:32,159
we have not the time to go

2814
02:13:32,159 --> 02:13:33,280
uh

2815
02:13:33,280 --> 02:13:36,320
indicating that but that's one of system

2816
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:37,760
and muhammad ali will show you its

2817
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:40,079
characteristic maybe i will

2818
02:13:40,079 --> 02:13:41,360
give

2819
02:13:41,360 --> 02:13:44,639
the head to mohandali

2820
02:14:01,440 --> 02:14:04,780
[Applause]

2821
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,840
we have problem of this you have we

2822
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:13,320
should have rear intrusion we are at ncr

2823
02:14:24,719 --> 02:14:28,079
i can add uh something uh this tool is

2824
02:14:28,079 --> 02:14:31,920
presented by uh by by you it can be uh

2825
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:34,079
reach the approach zero trust

2826
02:14:34,079 --> 02:14:37,920
architecture you can with this uh tools

2827
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:40,480
reach the euro trust architecture

2828
02:14:40,480 --> 02:14:43,520
is what demand by missed by all

2829
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:46,960
standards and all compliance needed now

2830
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:49,599
to migrate the classical architecture

2831
02:14:49,599 --> 02:14:54,360
where the zero trust architecture

2832
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:59,040
yes it's a

2833
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:00,880
paladin that

2834
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:02,880
should be a little bit uh you know

2835
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:04,560
searched by

2836
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:06,719
seaside

2837
02:15:06,719 --> 02:15:08,560
since you are the guy the most secure

2838
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:10,800
you know so

2839
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:13,679
you need that yeah

2840
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:17,040
so handling will go through glp

2841
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:19,440
once he's ready

2842
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:22,000
and after that he will show you taranis

2843
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,239
which is the tool how to generate your

2844
02:15:24,239 --> 02:15:26,079
mailing list easily

2845
02:15:26,079 --> 02:15:28,000
you know to collect

2846
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:31,280
alerts from various mailing lists and

2847
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:34,000
also from also your local team you know

2848
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:35,520
discovery of

2849
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:37,520
events or things

2850
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:40,639
and we can generate to the constituency

2851
02:15:40,639 --> 02:15:42,639
you know

2852
02:15:42,639 --> 02:15:45,199
alert about vulnerability discovered or

2853
02:15:45,199 --> 02:15:47,760
arrested about the warm discovery by

2854
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:49,119
serger

2855
02:15:49,119 --> 02:15:54,400
attack going on if we decide to make it

2856
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:56,000
public you know because a lot of

2857
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,360
incidents you have to keep them

2858
02:15:57,360 --> 02:15:59,840
confidential until sometimes when you

2859
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:01,440
decide that

2860
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:02,719
you should have

2861
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:05,679
a place you know guys who can talk with

2862
02:16:05,679 --> 02:16:07,760
the press to

2863
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:10,800
well explain what's going on and not to

2864
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:14,639
make people too frightened or

2865
02:16:14,639 --> 02:16:17,280
and so on

2866
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:18,880
so

2867
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:21,199
um

2868
02:16:21,199 --> 02:16:24,000
is not ready

2869
02:16:24,159 --> 02:16:27,440
we have those problem

2870
02:16:27,440 --> 02:16:30,719
so i continue talking

2871
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:33,840
so this is important especially i know

2872
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:36,558
that a lot of you want to be

2873
02:16:36,558 --> 02:16:37,760
first

2874
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:39,840
to go to the first accreditation you

2875
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:42,718
know membership not accreditation

2876
02:16:42,718 --> 02:16:44,000
and

2877
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:45,760
for example first

2878
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:46,799
they

2879
02:16:46,799 --> 02:16:48,478
ask that

2880
02:16:48,478 --> 02:16:51,359
francis see it come and make your audits

2881
02:16:51,359 --> 02:16:52,638
assessments

2882
02:16:52,638 --> 02:16:54,959
and the assessment consists to see if

2883
02:16:54,959 --> 02:16:57,519
you are implementing the correct

2884
02:16:57,519 --> 02:17:00,398
process of incident handling

2885
02:17:00,398 --> 02:17:02,160
mainly

2886
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:05,359
those kind of system will permit you to

2887
02:17:05,359 --> 02:17:08,558
implement them efficiently and that this

2888
02:17:08,558 --> 02:17:11,200
will continue in time

2889
02:17:11,200 --> 02:17:15,200
and of course you have first little team

2890
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:17,920
of assistant handed but you will grow

2891
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:20,160
and also for their little team like i

2892
02:17:20,160 --> 02:17:21,200
told you

2893
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:23,599
uh sharing of information between them

2894
02:17:23,599 --> 02:17:27,040
is very important and also for the

2895
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:29,200
chief of the unseated attending

2896
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:31,679
team he has to make a correct follow-up

2897
02:17:31,679 --> 02:17:32,799
of uh

2898
02:17:32,799 --> 02:17:34,558
incidental resolution

incident

3043
02:23:29,680 --> 02:23:30,880
within

3044
02:23:30,880 --> 02:23:32,720
glp

3045
02:23:32,720 --> 02:23:33,350
so

3046
02:23:33,350 --> 02:23:36,000
[Music]

3047
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
we have the monitoring

3048
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:38,960
agent

3049
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:40,880
after uh

3050
02:23:40,880 --> 02:23:42,000
check the

3051
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:43,600
intrusion event

3052
02:23:43,600 --> 02:23:47,439
within sir he will

3053
02:23:47,439 --> 02:23:50,240
create a constituent about that so we

3054
02:23:50,240 --> 02:23:55,000
have to look like that

3055
02:23:59,400 --> 02:24:01,359
[Music]

3056
02:24:01,359 --> 02:24:04,479
okay he moved to the menu assistance

3057
02:24:04,479 --> 02:24:06,960
tickets

3058
02:24:07,600 --> 02:24:09,840
and now we have to

3059
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:13,760
create a new ticket by click on the plus

3060
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:16,080

[Music]

3062
02:24:20,640 --> 02:24:24,240
so as you can see also on the screen

3063
02:24:24,240 --> 02:24:27,359
this is the open date of the tickets so

3064
02:24:27,359 --> 02:24:29,840
the type it is a transition so the

3065
02:24:29,840 --> 02:24:32,000
monitoring agent should be

3066
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,080
sure that is uh

3067
02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:36,880

3242
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,800
uh the group of investigation that

3243
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:44,560
involved the uh

3244
02:32:44,560 --> 02:32:46,080
investigation

3245
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:48,479
this included an incident

3246
02:32:48,479 --> 02:32:51,520
handling level two so if in management

3247
02:32:51,520 --> 02:32:53,359
so you can

3248
02:32:53,359 --> 02:32:55,760
for example classify your

3249
02:32:55,760 --> 02:32:58,399
your staff

3250
02:32:59,439 --> 02:33:00,960
okay

3251
02:33:00,960 --> 02:33:02,080
that's

3252
02:33:02,080 --> 02:33:03,520
all about

3253

jp

3254
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:16,629
[Music]

3255
02:33:18,840 --> 02:33:20,800
maybe

3256
02:33:20,800 --> 02:33:24,279
say some words

3257
02:33:40,319 --> 02:33:42,640
okay just back to

3258
02:33:42,640 --> 02:33:47,439
make link between two sides of course

3259
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:50,800
muhamdali cannot really go

3260
02:33:50,800 --> 02:33:51,680
well

3261
02:33:51,680 --> 02:33:53,600
to all the

3262
02:33:53,600 --> 02:33:56,479
capability of such tool how to

3263
02:33:56,479 --> 02:33:58,399
open the ticket ticket as you understood

3264
02:33:58,399 --> 02:34:00,880
is an incident coming uh through emails

3265
02:34:00,880 --> 02:34:01,680
or

3266
02:34:01,680 --> 02:34:04,640
that you manually edit inside the system

3267
02:34:04,640 --> 02:34:06,640
and to follow make the follow-up of the

3268
02:34:06,640 --> 02:34:08,080
various

3269
02:34:08,080 --> 02:34:10,880
phase of treatment of the incident

3270
02:34:10,880 --> 02:34:13,040
and get out with the response to the

3271
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:16,479
constituency and to irishly knowledge

3272
02:34:16,479 --> 02:34:18,319
base about the incident how it was

3273
02:34:18,319 --> 02:34:21,200
resolved but at least sir also in case

3274
02:34:21,200 --> 02:34:23,120
in the future if there is repetitive

3275
02:34:23,120 --> 02:34:25,760
incident to case of them and to make

3276
02:34:25,760 --> 02:34:27,520
correlation above them and to more

3277
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:29,680
understand what's going on if we are

3278
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:31,600
think of

3279
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:34,479
a specific attack and so on

3280
02:34:34,479 --> 02:34:37,520
oh maybe uh what can i do is just to say

3281
02:34:37,520 --> 02:34:38,399
now

3282
02:34:38,399 --> 02:34:41,040
one thing very important for

3283
02:34:41,040 --> 02:34:42,000
cert

3284
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:43,920
is to be visible from the outside that

3285
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:46,160
people know they are caring about their

3286
02:34:46,160 --> 02:34:48,640
security means you have to dispatch you

3287
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:50,960
know to broadcast

3288
02:34:50,960 --> 02:34:53,040
discovered vulnerability that people

3289
02:34:53,040 --> 02:34:54,560
particularly system

3290
02:34:54,560 --> 02:34:57,520
the best way you know

3291
02:34:57,520 --> 02:35:01,280
to protect the constituency and yourself

3292
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:03,600
is to patch vulnerability as soon as

3293
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:06,000
they are discovered by editor software

3294
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,720
editor linux microsoft specially and so

3295
02:35:08,720 --> 02:35:10,000
on

3296
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:13,920
or microsoft their own system of uh

3297
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:14,800
uh

3298
02:35:14,800 --> 02:35:17,600
patch application and so on but all the

3299
02:35:17,600 --> 02:35:20,640
rest of uh you know software editor

3300
02:35:20,640 --> 02:35:21,600
uh

3301
02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:23,200
just about guys they have discovered

3302
02:35:23,200 --> 02:35:26,240
vulnerability and give the patch how to

3303
02:35:26,240 --> 02:35:29,040
close this vulnerability and the role of

3304
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:30,240
cesart

3305
02:35:30,240 --> 02:35:32,319
is to immediately inform its cost

3306
02:35:32,319 --> 02:35:34,880
situation about

3307
02:35:34,880 --> 02:35:37,920
new vulnerability and give them

3308
02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:40,479
the link url and so on to patch the

3309
02:35:40,479 --> 02:35:41,920
system easily

3310
02:35:41,920 --> 02:35:44,880
and uh let's give you visibility to the

3311
02:35:44,880 --> 02:35:46,560
community also

3312
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:49,359
but you can also make special you know

3313
02:35:49,359 --> 02:35:51,520
mailing especially in our country to

3314
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:55,680
just make some awareness about

3315
02:35:55,680 --> 02:35:56,479
like

3316
02:35:56,479 --> 02:35:59,680
you know a lot of people are not very

3317
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:02,560
worried about what is the virus

3318
02:36:02,560 --> 02:36:05,280
and it can happen to you that people

3319
02:36:05,280 --> 02:36:07,120
confront that with you know medical

3320
02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:10,399
virus believe me it can exist

3321
02:36:10,399 --> 02:36:11,439
so uh

3322
02:36:11,439 --> 02:36:13,920
i'm just laughing but

3323
02:36:13,920 --> 02:36:15,920
to inform the people what is the virus

3324
02:36:15,920 --> 02:36:18,560
how to protect yourself don't open you

3325
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:21,840
know an email with an attached you know

3326
02:36:21,840 --> 02:36:24,000
such kind of thing really

3327
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,399
increase the protection of

3328
02:36:26,399 --> 02:36:28,479
the cyberspace

3329
02:36:28,479 --> 02:36:29,680
and

3330
02:36:29,680 --> 02:36:33,040
a man who is aware about danger

3331
02:36:33,040 --> 02:36:35,439
is better than any security software too

3332
02:36:35,439 --> 02:36:38,479
the best firewall in fact is

3333
02:36:38,479 --> 02:36:39,920
the awareness

3334
02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:41,680
of the

3335
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:46,319
citizen of the professional about danger

3336
02:36:46,319 --> 02:36:48,800
don't do mistake as you know

3337
02:36:48,800 --> 02:36:51,120
most of the new attacks are social

3338
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:52,880
engineering attacks

3339
02:36:52,880 --> 02:36:55,680
what happened to critical infrastructure

3340
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:57,920
or what happened to banks and so on is

3341
02:36:57,920 --> 02:37:00,560
to send an email simple email to an

3342
02:37:00,560 --> 02:37:02,000
employee

3343
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:05,120
and he just click on attached file and

3344
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:06,640
he infects

3345
02:37:06,640 --> 02:37:08,240
the whole network

3346
02:37:08,240 --> 02:37:10,720
and through that network they can also

3347
02:37:10,720 --> 02:37:12,960
if it's critical infrastructure is not

3348
02:37:12,960 --> 02:37:15,920
really well protected is related they

3349
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:18,399
can go through and enter the

3350
02:37:18,399 --> 02:37:20,479
process you know the

3351
02:37:20,479 --> 02:37:24,479
manufacturing process and can make

3352
02:37:24,479 --> 02:37:26,319
big you know hurt to

3353
02:37:26,319 --> 02:37:28,720
the critical infrastructure

3354
02:37:28,720 --> 02:37:31,680
so awareness is very important and you

3355
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:32,880
have to

3356
02:37:32,880 --> 02:37:34,960
take it into account

3357
02:37:34,960 --> 02:37:37,439
and patching is very important because

3358
02:37:37,439 --> 02:37:39,359
they close the hole

3359
02:37:39,359 --> 02:37:43,520
by which warm and by which active attack

3360
02:37:43,520 --> 02:37:45,840
of intruder

3361
02:37:45,840 --> 02:37:48,880
to spread or to hurt you

3362
02:37:48,880 --> 02:37:49,840
so it

3363
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:52,960
doesn't underestimate this

3364
02:37:52,960 --> 02:37:54,640
you know for your activity as the

3365
02:37:54,640 --> 02:37:56,720
national assistant but also as a privacy

3366
02:37:56,720 --> 02:37:59,520
seat for your constituency

3367
02:37:59,520 --> 02:38:02,319
so muhammad ali will

3368
02:38:02,319 --> 02:38:05,280
will show you a tool taranis which

3369
02:38:05,280 --> 02:38:07,920
permit to easily

3370
02:38:07,920 --> 02:38:09,680
create that service

3371
02:38:09,680 --> 02:38:11,280
which has got told you is your

3372
02:38:11,280 --> 02:38:13,920
visibility from the outside when people

3373
02:38:13,920 --> 02:38:17,600
don't spread too much you know email

3374
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:21,040
their group vulnerability so

3375
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:23,200
too much email means people will not see

3376
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:24,000
them

3377
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:25,920
but the group by creating if there is

3378
02:38:25,920 --> 02:38:28,479
something critical send immediately if

3379
02:38:28,479 --> 02:38:29,359
not

3380
02:38:29,359 --> 02:38:30,479
regroup

3381
02:38:30,479 --> 02:38:32,160
every few days

3382
02:38:32,160 --> 02:38:34,399
you know and then

3383
02:38:34,399 --> 02:38:36,160
send them the notification that they

3384
02:38:36,160 --> 02:38:38,080
found various whenever you discover

3385
02:38:38,080 --> 02:38:39,120
various

3386
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:42,720
links to how to patch or if not yet

3387
02:38:42,720 --> 02:38:45,600
patched how precautionary majors they

3388
02:38:45,600 --> 02:38:46,880
should take

3389
02:38:46,880 --> 02:38:48,479
to prevent

3390
02:38:48,479 --> 02:38:51,120
until a patch is

3391
02:38:51,120 --> 02:38:53,359
published by the editor so please

3392
02:38:53,359 --> 02:38:56,359

constituent about

3405
02:39:33,760 --> 02:39:35,520
new vulnerability

3406
02:39:35,520 --> 02:39:38,479
and new manual

3407
02:39:38,479 --> 02:39:41,359

02:39:49,600 --> 02:39:51,439
1015

3413
02:39:51,439 --> 02:39:53,680
source of information

3414
02:39:53,680 --> 02:39:57,120
so let's see the big deal how to manage

3415
02:39:57,120 --> 02:39:57,920
this

3416
02:39:57,920 --> 02:39:59,280
amount of

3417
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:01,280
source of information

3418
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:02,800
so

3419
02:40:02,800 --> 02:40:03,760
let's

3420
02:40:03,760 --> 02:40:05,439
go how

3421
02:40:05,439 --> 02:40:06,560
let's see

3422
02:40:06,560 --> 02:40:09,040
let's see together how to

3423
02:40:09,040 --> 02:40:12,800
inform constituents about

3424
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:15,120
new cyber threats vulnerabilities or

3425
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:18,880
malware integration so as uh

3426
02:40:18,880 --> 02:40:24,399
manager i have daily to to check

3427
02:40:26,479 --> 02:40:29,439
new vulnerability in your marijuana

3428
02:40:29,439 --> 02:40:31,680
so

3429
02:40:32,240 --> 02:40:35,359
to check use so i have to click on the

3430
02:40:35,359 --> 02:40:37,640
assets

3431
02:40:37,640 --> 02:40:39,040
[Music]

3432
02:40:39,040 --> 02:40:41,600
tabs tabulation so

3433
02:40:41,600 --> 02:40:44,560
assets as you can see here this is the

3434
02:40:44,560 --> 02:40:48,640
pipeline of the collected item

3435
02:40:48,640 --> 02:40:50,640
so collected by

3436
02:40:50,640 --> 02:40:52,720
taranis so

3437
02:40:52,720 --> 02:40:55,200
as you can see here the

3438
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:58,240
the workflow of taranis let's

3439
02:40:58,240 --> 02:41:00,160
begin from the collector but the

3440
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:03,200
collector is running in

3441
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:05,520
background mode so yeah

3442
02:41:05,520 --> 02:41:07,359
if you can see the

3443
02:41:07,359 --> 02:41:10,240
progress of collectors it is with the

3444
02:41:10,240 --> 02:41:11,439
linux

3445
02:41:11,439 --> 02:41:13,120
command line

3446
02:41:13,120 --> 02:41:16,080
and there are all the work uh the rest

3447
02:41:16,080 --> 02:41:19,359
of the workflow so by this

3448
02:41:19,359 --> 02:41:21,760
graphical user interface so we start

3449
02:41:21,760 --> 02:41:24,240
with with assets so all the item

3450
02:41:24,240 --> 02:41:25,920
collected by the collector running

3451
02:41:25,920 --> 02:41:27,680
enviro crowd

3452
02:41:27,680 --> 02:41:29,200
is

3453
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:34,800
control to the asses pipeline and so

3454
02:41:34,800 --> 02:41:37,279
i have to check what is the news for

3455
02:41:37,279 --> 02:41:39,760
example

3456
02:41:40,160 --> 02:41:44,240
i find out a vulnerability that affect

3457
02:41:44,240 --> 02:41:45,680
google chrome

3458
02:41:45,680 --> 02:41:48,319
web browser so

3459
02:41:48,319 --> 02:41:49,680
i like to

3460
02:41:49,680 --> 02:41:52,240
use it as an example

3461
02:41:52,240 --> 02:41:54,160
for

3462
02:41:54,160 --> 02:41:55,920
writing advisory about this

3463
02:41:55,920 --> 02:41:57,520
vulnerability

3464
02:41:57,520 --> 02:41:57,880
so

3465
02:41:57,880 --> 02:42:00,640
[Music]

3466
02:42:00,640 --> 02:42:02,160
if you have to

3467
02:42:02,160 --> 02:42:03,439
to view the details of the

3468
02:42:03,439 --> 02:42:05,920
vulnerabilities so i have to

3469
02:42:05,920 --> 02:42:07,520
to click on

3470
02:42:07,520 --> 02:42:08,399
the

3471
02:42:08,399 --> 02:42:10,640
loop

3472
02:42:10,880 --> 02:42:13,359
icon so description table has been

3473
02:42:13,359 --> 02:42:15,600
updated

3474
02:42:15,600 --> 02:42:18,240
for windows mic and the next switch will

3475
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:21,279
be root over coming this week so

3476
02:42:21,279 --> 02:42:24,319
okay i find that this is

3477
02:42:24,319 --> 02:42:24,960
an

3478
02:42:24,960 --> 02:42:27,120
intelligent uh

3479
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:29,840
item that will impact

3480
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:32,960
micro statements so i have to inform

3481
02:42:32,960 --> 02:42:36,640
them quickly to to apply the

3482
02:42:36,640 --> 02:42:38,640
their patch before

3483
02:42:38,640 --> 02:42:40,319
the before

3484
02:42:40,319 --> 02:42:41,840
being attacked

3485
02:42:41,840 --> 02:42:43,279
so

3486
02:42:43,279 --> 02:42:45,200
uh if you can see

3487
02:42:45,200 --> 02:42:48,560
the other items so you can send personal

3488
02:42:48,560 --> 02:42:51,359
mail to to a colleague to your colleague

3489
02:42:51,359 --> 02:42:52,840
directly

3490
02:42:52,840 --> 02:42:55,279
so how to

3491
02:42:55,279 --> 02:42:57,840
make the

3492
02:42:58,160 --> 02:43:00,800
email of your colleague for example and

3493
02:43:00,800 --> 02:43:02,319
set it

3494
02:43:02,319 --> 02:43:04,319
this article for

3495
02:43:04,319 --> 02:43:07,319
information

3496
02:43:10,560 --> 02:43:14,560
okay i selected the receiver

3497
02:43:14,560 --> 02:43:16,880
my colleague as a receiver so and send

3498
02:43:16,880 --> 02:43:18,080
mail

3499
02:43:18,080 --> 02:43:21,200
so an email will be received to

3500
02:43:21,200 --> 02:43:26,040
micro league as you can see here

3501
02:43:30,580 --> 02:43:33,739
[Music]

3502
02:43:47,120 --> 02:43:51,000
you have to wait till

3503
02:43:51,439 --> 02:43:53,680
okay

3504
02:43:54,960 --> 02:43:57,840
so i returned back to the taranis uh

3505
02:43:57,840 --> 02:44:00,640
graphical user interface

3506
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:01,530
and read the

3507
02:44:01,530 --> 02:44:02,720
[Music]

3508
02:44:02,720 --> 02:44:04,560
the article

3509
02:44:04,560 --> 02:44:06,880
so i have to

3510
02:44:06,880 --> 02:44:07,600
to

3511
02:44:07,600 --> 02:44:10,399
start another to analyze this item so to

3512
02:44:10,399 --> 02:44:12,479
analyze this item i have to

3513
02:44:12,479 --> 02:44:15,040
click to the to this button

3514
02:44:15,040 --> 02:44:16,240
so

3515
02:44:16,240 --> 02:44:18,880
description command so uh

3516
02:44:18,880 --> 02:44:21,120
as you can see here

3517
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:25,120
the terminus is able to collect the

3518
02:44:25,120 --> 02:44:28,319
common vulnerability exposure identifier

3519
02:44:28,319 --> 02:44:31,520
so this is he can match the regular

3520
02:44:31,520 --> 02:44:33,200
expression of the

3521
02:44:33,200 --> 02:44:35,840
vulnerability

3522
02:44:36,160 --> 02:44:37,359
exposure

3523
02:44:37,359 --> 02:44:39,680
so i have to

3524
02:44:39,680 --> 02:44:41,760
to send command to the

3525
02:44:41,760 --> 02:44:44,479
alert and learning team so

3526
02:44:44,479 --> 02:44:47,840
it is to

3527
02:44:48,080 --> 02:44:51,120
to publish

3528
02:44:51,120 --> 02:44:52,319
some other

3529
02:44:52,319 --> 02:44:53,840
command

3530
02:44:53,840 --> 02:44:56,560
so and to how to define status branding

3531
02:44:56,560 --> 02:44:58,240
that's mean

3532
02:44:58,240 --> 02:45:01,600
here this item will be entered in the

3533
02:45:01,600 --> 02:45:05,920
uh analysis uh pipeline rating so

3534
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:08,640
i know that uh most of my question to

3535
02:45:08,640 --> 02:45:11,040
end use this web browser

3536
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:13,840
so i rate this item as

3537
02:45:13,840 --> 02:45:15,120
high

3538
02:45:15,120 --> 02:45:19,040
and then i click to the

3539
02:45:20,160 --> 02:45:21,760
create analysis

3540
02:45:21,760 --> 02:45:24,080
so what

3541
02:45:24,080 --> 02:45:25,040
the

3542
02:45:25,040 --> 02:45:29,680
alert and learning team do after that

3543
02:45:29,680 --> 02:45:31,920
so as a

3544
02:45:31,920 --> 02:45:33,279
writer so

3545
02:45:33,279 --> 02:45:35,600
i advise you when you're using tyrannos

3546
02:45:35,600 --> 02:45:38,080
to separate rules

3547
02:45:38,080 --> 02:45:40,880
so you have to alert a learning writer

3548
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:43,840
and the letter government approval and

3549
02:45:43,840 --> 02:45:46,319
letter dwelling publisher

3550
02:45:46,319 --> 02:45:48,080
maybe someone

3551
02:45:48,080 --> 02:45:51,439
do some mistakes and the other

3552
02:45:51,439 --> 02:45:52,399
don't

3553
02:45:52,399 --> 02:45:54,000
correct it

3554
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:59,040
so as a writer how can find the

3555
02:45:59,359 --> 02:46:01,680
the new item to

3556
02:46:01,680 --> 02:46:03,520
to handle

3557
02:46:03,520 --> 02:46:06,020
so this one selection

3558
02:46:06,020 --> 02:46:07,279
[Music]

3559
02:46:07,279 --> 02:46:10,560
analyze and click to analyze

3560
02:46:10,560 --> 02:46:13,920
so this one

3561
02:46:14,479 --> 02:46:16,720
then

3562
02:46:17,040 --> 02:46:18,080
if we

3563
02:46:18,080 --> 02:46:21,760
to file to check the details

3564
02:46:21,760 --> 02:46:22,840

3565
02:46:22,840 --> 02:46:25,680
details and

3566
02:46:25,680 --> 02:46:29,279
to write security advisory related

3567
02:46:29,279 --> 02:46:31,920
to this item so he

3568
02:46:31,920 --> 02:46:33,120
click on

3569
02:46:33,120 --> 02:46:35,439
this button analysis

3570
02:46:35,439 --> 02:46:39,520
and then choose create a new advisory

3571
02:46:39,520 --> 02:46:42,240
so and then click to the

3572
02:46:42,240 --> 02:46:44,000
create button

3573
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,720
so as you can see on the screen

3574
02:46:46,720 --> 02:46:48,479
the

3575
02:46:48,479 --> 02:46:52,080
writing tabs of general matrix platforms

3576
02:46:52,080 --> 02:46:54,960
products summary consequence description

3577
02:46:54,960 --> 02:46:56,399
solution

3578
02:46:56,399 --> 02:46:59,200
tlp number and links

3579
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:00,160
so

3580
02:47:00,160 --> 02:47:03,920
first of all we have to define the title

3581
02:47:03,920 --> 02:47:06,160
so

3582
02:47:06,160 --> 02:47:07,600
multiple

3583
02:47:07,600 --> 02:47:10,600

3584
02:47:13,120 --> 02:47:15,279

google

3586
02:47:18,640 --> 02:47:20,640
chrome

3587
02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:22,479
so

3588
02:47:22,479 --> 02:47:25,760
when he check the technical details you

3589
02:47:25,760 --> 02:47:27,920
have to define also the damage

3590
02:47:27,920 --> 02:47:29,279
description

3591
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:30,240
so

3592
02:47:30,240 --> 02:47:33,760
the vulnerability related of web browser

3593
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:34,800
is to

3594
02:47:34,800 --> 02:47:38,319
execute a arbitrary code using the

3595
02:47:38,319 --> 02:47:40,080
victim privilege

3596
02:47:40,080 --> 02:47:41,760
so

3597
02:47:41,760 --> 02:47:44,399
damage description that that may be the

3598
02:47:44,399 --> 02:47:47,680
data loss or that they left may because

3599
02:47:47,680 --> 02:47:48,640
all

3600
02:47:48,640 --> 02:47:51,200
that is like financial damage

3601
02:47:51,200 --> 02:47:54,640
or hardware failing or not so

3602
02:47:54,640 --> 02:47:56,880
the best issues is to do data loss or

3603
02:47:56,880 --> 02:47:58,399
data theft

3604
02:47:58,399 --> 02:48:02,399
then we will go to the matrix steps so

3605
02:48:02,399 --> 02:48:05,439
to define the impact of the

3606
02:48:05,439 --> 02:48:08,240
vulnerabilities we have to

3607
02:48:08,240 --> 02:48:09,359
uh

3608
02:48:09,359 --> 02:48:11,840
to answer all this question

3609
02:48:11,840 --> 02:48:14,479
this one this question

3610
02:48:14,479 --> 02:48:15,760
both

3611
02:48:15,760 --> 02:48:18,160
are related to the probability

3612
02:48:18,160 --> 02:48:22,319
of uh to be exploited by hacker

3613
02:48:22,319 --> 02:48:24,960
and the on the bottom that is

3614
02:48:24,960 --> 02:48:27,439
to define what is the damage

3615
02:48:27,439 --> 02:48:30,080
so as you can see here so the

3616
02:48:30,080 --> 02:48:34,560
probability is low or medium high value

3617
02:48:34,560 --> 02:48:37,680
same thing for damage maybe low medium

3618
02:48:37,680 --> 02:48:38,800
high

3619
02:48:38,800 --> 02:48:39,680
so

3620
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:41,439
we have to

3621
02:48:41,439 --> 02:48:44,800
answer all these questions after reading

3622
02:48:44,800 --> 02:48:45,600
the

3623
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:48,560
article related to the

3624
02:48:48,560 --> 02:48:51,359
vulnerability of

3625
02:48:51,359 --> 02:48:54,880
so if it is the default configuration so

3626
02:48:54,880 --> 02:48:56,000
it is no

3627
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,960
exploit code available

3628
02:48:58,960 --> 02:49:01,920
now detail is available so

3629
02:49:01,920 --> 02:49:04,240
fully

3630
02:49:04,240 --> 02:49:06,800
access required so it is a physical

3631
02:49:06,800 --> 02:49:09,439
access online access or internet access

3632
02:49:09,439 --> 02:49:11,520
maybe the hackers

3633
02:49:11,520 --> 02:49:14,240
inside the

3634
02:49:14,240 --> 02:49:15,230
by fishing

3635
02:49:15,230 --> 02:49:16,960
[Music]

3636
02:49:16,960 --> 02:49:18,560
attract the

3637
02:49:18,560 --> 02:49:22,000
the victim to to visit

3638
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,479
his fake or malicious website

3639
02:49:24,479 --> 02:49:29,439
and then execute or he can he can again

3640
02:49:29,439 --> 02:49:33,200
also he can exploit the vulnerability of

3641
02:49:33,200 --> 02:49:35,439
if the victim uses a

3642
02:49:35,439 --> 02:49:38,160
google chrome browser so if the

3643
02:49:38,160 --> 02:49:40,080
exploitation of the vulnerability

3644
02:49:40,080 --> 02:49:43,200
require admin or use

3645
02:49:43,200 --> 02:49:46,319
not no required example

3646
02:49:46,319 --> 02:49:50,240
admin privilege so exploit complexity

3647
02:49:50,240 --> 02:49:52,720
so maybe complex user interaction

3648
02:49:52,720 --> 02:49:55,840
required so

3649
02:49:57,760 --> 02:50:01,279
easy so by fishing

3650
02:50:01,439 --> 02:50:03,680
actively exploited so we have

3651
02:50:03,680 --> 02:50:06,160
information that

3652
02:50:06,160 --> 02:50:08,160
this information that this is a

3653
02:50:08,160 --> 02:50:10,399
vulnerability at a time exploited or not

3654
02:50:10,399 --> 02:50:13,359
smart expected no solution available so

3655
02:50:13,359 --> 02:50:14,560
yes

3656
02:50:14,560 --> 02:50:17,359
that's about probability the then about

3657
02:50:17,359 --> 02:50:19,120
the damage the

3658
02:50:19,120 --> 02:50:20,880
exploitation of vulnerability cause

3659
02:50:20,880 --> 02:50:23,359
daniel or service now

3660
02:50:23,359 --> 02:50:27,279
execute arbitrary code yes user right

3661
02:50:27,279 --> 02:50:29,600
for example as you can see the

3662
02:50:29,600 --> 02:50:32,240
the damage changes automatically

3663
02:50:32,240 --> 02:50:34,399
remote right so

3664
02:50:34,399 --> 02:50:37,520
now privilege escalation

3665
02:50:37,520 --> 02:50:38,720
maybe

3666
02:50:38,720 --> 02:50:41,840
information leakage so yes system

3667
02:50:41,840 --> 02:50:43,279
information

3668
02:50:43,279 --> 02:50:46,000
uh yes data so when exploiting this

3669
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:49,439
vulnerability hackers can

3670
02:50:49,439 --> 02:50:52,640
browse the data of his victim

3671
02:50:52,640 --> 02:50:54,080
so

3672
02:50:54,080 --> 02:50:56,479
i think that i will answer to the all of

3673
02:50:56,479 --> 02:50:58,560
the question so the

3674
02:50:58,560 --> 02:51:00,560
impact of this vulnerability is

3675
02:51:00,560 --> 02:51:04,160
probability medium and damage high so

3676
02:51:04,160 --> 02:51:06,479
platform

3677
02:51:06,479 --> 02:51:09,438
maybe windows

3678
02:51:11,359 --> 02:51:13,680
windows

3679
02:51:13,680 --> 02:51:15,920
those meeting system

3680
02:51:15,920 --> 02:51:19,640
you can see here

3681
02:51:19,840 --> 02:51:22,399
is related to

3682
02:51:22,399 --> 02:51:23,200
the

3683
02:51:23,200 --> 02:51:28,000
common product enumeration database so

3684
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:29,279
you can

3685
02:51:29,279 --> 02:51:34,880
he automatically import the xml file

3686
02:51:34,960 --> 02:51:36,319
from the

3687
02:51:36,319 --> 02:51:38,000
cpe website

3688
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:41,030

to choose

3692
02:51:47,040 --> 02:51:47,920
the

affected

3694
02:51:49,200 --> 02:51:52,880
platform so i have to choose for example

3695
02:51:52,880 --> 02:51:56,000
windows 8 operating system

3696
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,800
then i move to the product tabs

3697
02:51:58,800 --> 02:52:02,960
same thing so the products the affected

3698
02:52:02,960 --> 02:52:03,930
google chrome

okay

3701
02:52:09,680 --> 02:52:14,120
so google chrome application

3702
02:52:14,880 --> 02:52:18,319
okay i select b

3703
02:52:18,479 --> 02:52:20,240
so i have to summary from that to

3704
02:52:20,240 --> 02:52:22,800
summarize this vulnerability

3705
02:52:22,800 --> 02:52:26,560
so another example of

3706
02:52:27,040 --> 02:52:29,840
summary

3707
02:52:31,200 --> 02:52:33,520

move quickly

3710
02:52:36,640 --> 02:52:37,840
so

3711
02:52:37,840 --> 02:52:38,880
also

3712
02:52:38,880 --> 02:52:41,520

what is the solution so to

3738

put shaped links so as you can see

i some

3761
02:55:45,120 --> 02:55:47,760
fields are missing so

3762
02:55:47,760 --> 02:55:49,120
it is okay

3763
02:55:49,120 --> 02:55:52,319
consequence description solution

3764
02:55:52,319 --> 02:55:55,279
lp white links and then have to click

3765
02:55:55,279 --> 02:55:56,840
save

3766
02:55:56,840 --> 02:55:58,640
so

3767
02:55:58,640 --> 02:56:01,279
then the

3768
02:56:01,279 --> 02:56:03,840
the the this advisor

3769
02:56:03,840 --> 02:56:06,720
enter on the

3770
02:56:06,720 --> 02:56:09,760
pipeline of of right

3771
02:56:09,760 --> 02:56:12,880
so as you can see here multiple

3772
02:56:12,880 --> 02:56:16,399
vulnerability in google chrome

3773
02:56:16,560 --> 02:56:17,359
so

3774
02:56:17,359 --> 02:56:20,479
he can edit this item or

3775
02:56:20,479 --> 02:56:21,279
to

3776
02:56:21,279 --> 02:56:22,399
if he's

3777
02:56:22,399 --> 02:56:25,040
finished writing this advisory

3778
02:56:25,040 --> 02:56:28,399
we call for ready for for review

3779
02:56:28,399 --> 02:56:31,600
so as you can see here later you have to

3780
02:56:31,600 --> 02:56:33,359
separate

3781
02:56:33,359 --> 02:56:35,200
user's roles

3782
02:56:35,200 --> 02:56:37,920
so the writers

3783
02:56:37,920 --> 02:56:41,200
cannot approve

3784
02:56:41,200 --> 02:56:43,359
this

3785
02:56:48,800 --> 02:56:50,240
i have to

3786
02:56:50,240 --> 02:56:51,040
log

3787
02:56:51,040 --> 02:56:52,880
logan as

3788
02:56:52,880 --> 02:56:54,399

3789
02:56:54,399 --> 02:56:57,040

3791
02:56:59,760 --> 02:57:00,800
so

3792
02:57:00,800 --> 02:57:03,599

3793
02:57:03,840 --> 02:57:05,370
my internet connection

3794
02:57:05,370 --> 02:57:06,640
[Music]

3795
02:57:06,640 --> 02:57:10,080
some interruption occur

3796
02:57:10,160 --> 02:57:13,439
approval so program approval

3797
02:57:13,439 --> 02:57:16,479
then the approval have to check the

3798
02:57:16,479 --> 02:57:18,720
right pipeline

3799
02:57:18,720 --> 02:57:20,640
and then so

3800
02:57:20,640 --> 02:57:23,439
to check the

3801
02:57:23,439 --> 02:57:25,840

02:57:27,120 --> 02:57:28,720
so this

3804
02:57:28,720 --> 02:57:30,800
banding

3805
02:57:30,800 --> 02:57:33,520

so he checked the details if uh

3815
02:57:57,760 --> 02:58:00,160
the writer

3816
02:58:00,160 --> 02:58:04,840

3933
03:03:14,399 --> 03:03:16,720
incident response

3934
03:03:16,720 --> 03:03:19,840
and computer

3935
03:03:24,960 --> 03:03:28,319
let's say foreign breach or attack

3936
03:03:28,319 --> 03:03:29,600
so

3937
03:03:29,600 --> 03:03:32,160
that response will be focused on the

3938
03:03:32,160 --> 03:03:34,240
containment of the terrestrial attack

3939
03:03:34,240 --> 03:03:35,120
but the

3940
03:03:35,120 --> 03:03:36,720
forensics involve

3941
03:03:36,720 --> 03:03:39,120
uh through examination of the data in

3942
03:03:39,120 --> 03:03:42,240
order to gain a complete understanding

3943
03:03:42,240 --> 03:03:44,080
of the breach in order to remediate the

3944
03:03:44,080 --> 03:03:45,600
attacks and

3945
03:03:45,600 --> 03:03:47,680
prevent the reference of course

3946
03:03:47,680 --> 03:03:49,840
so

3947
03:03:50,160 --> 03:03:52,840
just a second

3948
03:03:52,840 --> 03:03:56,080
okay so the incident response is as i

3949
03:03:56,080 --> 03:03:59,760
said the action taken immediately uh

3950
03:03:59,760 --> 03:04:03,359
security compromise uh attack or breach

3951
03:04:03,359 --> 03:04:05,120
depends on

3952
03:04:05,120 --> 03:04:07,040
what kind of incident we face in

3953
03:04:07,040 --> 03:04:09,359
addition to the shutdown the attack the

3954
03:04:09,359 --> 03:04:13,040
responders must also present and this is

3955
03:04:13,040 --> 03:04:14,880
very important to know

3956
03:04:14,880 --> 03:04:17,279
so the responder must preserve all

3957
03:04:17,279 --> 03:04:20,319
fifteenth evidence uh for later review

3958
03:04:20,319 --> 03:04:23,680
and examination uh they require

3959
03:04:23,680 --> 03:04:26,399
a team of experimented experienced

3960
03:04:26,399 --> 03:04:28,319
professionals who understand how to

3961
03:04:28,319 --> 03:04:30,960
respond to the incident while carefully

3962
03:04:30,960 --> 03:04:32,800
preserving evidence

3963
03:04:32,800 --> 03:04:34,560
attempting to restore or recover

3964
03:04:34,560 --> 03:04:36,800
affirmation from a compromised computer

3965
03:04:36,800 --> 03:04:38,160
and this

3966
03:04:38,160 --> 03:04:40,399
is always an issue because when the

3967
03:04:40,399 --> 03:04:42,080
organization says for example a

3968
03:04:42,080 --> 03:04:44,160
ransomware the first thing that they do

3969
03:04:44,160 --> 03:04:47,760
is they try to restore the data which

3970
03:04:47,760 --> 03:04:49,760
make us solutions

3971
03:04:49,760 --> 03:04:50,880
evidence

3972
03:04:50,880 --> 03:04:53,439
so uh

3973
03:04:53,439 --> 03:04:55,439
the the resolve or recovery of

3974
03:04:55,439 --> 03:04:56,640
information

3975
03:04:56,640 --> 03:04:58,560
from this compromised computer or

3976
03:04:58,560 --> 03:05:00,240
network would cause

3977
03:05:00,240 --> 03:05:03,279
an irreferable damage to the file or the

3978
03:05:03,279 --> 03:05:04,479
system

3979
03:05:04,479 --> 03:05:05,760
let's say that

3980
03:05:05,760 --> 03:05:08,319
immediate response can potentially do

3981
03:05:08,319 --> 03:05:11,439
more harm than good

3982
03:05:11,439 --> 03:05:13,600
also the most icy professional are not

3983
03:05:13,600 --> 03:05:16,080
requested to respond to breach properly

3984
03:05:16,080 --> 03:05:18,000
so they need assistance or team of

3985
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:19,439
professionals

3986
03:05:19,439 --> 03:05:21,600
to handle the most sophisticated fresh

3987
03:05:21,600 --> 03:05:24,000
event with precision and speed getting

3988
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:25,760
the answers uh

3989
03:05:25,760 --> 03:05:27,760
they need and placing the organization

3990
03:05:27,760 --> 03:05:30,160
in the best position to mitigate law and

3991
03:05:30,160 --> 03:05:32,479
keep their business operation

3992
03:05:32,479 --> 03:05:33,600
so

3993
03:05:33,600 --> 03:05:35,520
when we thought now about the cyber

3994
03:05:35,520 --> 03:05:37,200
politics it

3995
03:05:37,200 --> 03:05:38,800
may be the same thing as the evidence

3996
03:05:38,800 --> 03:05:41,120
responsibly some difference so the

3997
03:05:41,120 --> 03:05:43,680
defender

3998
03:05:45,359 --> 03:05:47,760
questions to foreign

3999
03:05:47,760 --> 03:05:49,920
let's say how did it happen

4000
03:05:49,920 --> 03:05:51,680
and how can it be prevented from

4001
03:05:51,680 --> 03:05:53,120
happening again

4002
03:05:53,120 --> 03:05:53,920
so

4003
03:05:53,920 --> 03:05:56,399
there the cyber forensics is the process

4004
03:05:56,399 --> 03:05:58,479
by which experts

4005
03:05:58,479 --> 03:05:59,439
collect

4006
03:05:59,439 --> 03:06:02,080
examine and analyze all

4007
03:06:02,080 --> 03:06:04,479
of the data from compromised uh

4008
03:06:04,479 --> 03:06:06,319
resources computer system network

4009
03:06:06,319 --> 03:06:08,319
storage devices etc

4010
03:06:08,319 --> 03:06:10,880
this is done in a manner consistent with

4011
03:06:10,880 --> 03:06:12,960
the best practice so that the evidence

4012
03:06:12,960 --> 03:06:15,520
will be admissible in the course of law

4013
03:06:15,520 --> 03:06:17,520
if necessary of course

4014
03:06:17,520 --> 03:06:19,520
so the evidence collection includes

4015
03:06:19,520 --> 03:06:21,680
identifying and securing addictive

4016
03:06:21,680 --> 03:06:24,640
device and all data including latent

4017
03:06:24,640 --> 03:06:26,960
data from the system latent or indian

4018
03:06:26,960 --> 03:06:29,279
data is the data that is not easily

4019
03:06:29,279 --> 03:06:31,040
accessible and generally take an

4020
03:06:31,040 --> 03:06:33,200
external problem

4021
03:06:33,200 --> 03:06:35,600
so this data is often hidden or even

4022
03:06:35,600 --> 03:06:40,160
related by the malware or by the attack

4023
03:06:40,160 --> 03:06:43,120
once the evidence is collected

4024
03:06:43,120 --> 03:06:44,720
and evaluated

4025
03:06:44,720 --> 03:06:46,640
we will see how we do that

4026
03:06:46,640 --> 03:06:50,319
it undergo a detailed analysis

4027
03:06:50,319 --> 03:06:52,399
of that question including the root

4028
03:06:52,399 --> 03:06:55,359
cause the scope of reach or

4029
03:06:55,359 --> 03:06:57,439
what that may be

4030
03:06:57,439 --> 03:06:59,359
each step of this process

4031
03:06:59,359 --> 03:07:03,200
must be carefully documented

4032
03:07:04,800 --> 03:07:06,680
so this

4033
03:07:06,680 --> 03:07:08,960
is someone

4034
03:07:08,960 --> 03:07:11,840
okay so uh

4035
03:07:11,840 --> 03:07:14,479
let's see that uh

4036
03:07:14,479 --> 03:07:17,680
the complexity uh

4037
03:07:17,680 --> 03:07:19,279
even the lies so

4038
03:07:19,279 --> 03:07:22,960
uh to meet this rising demand uh

4039
03:07:22,960 --> 03:07:26,800
of uh customer for she said organization

4040
03:07:26,800 --> 03:07:28,720
are being forced to scale their

4041
03:07:28,720 --> 03:07:30,560
operation in a way that introduce

4042
03:07:30,560 --> 03:07:32,399
additional

4043
03:07:32,399 --> 03:07:35,200
complexity and those society are more

4044
03:07:35,200 --> 03:07:38,080
involved in operation and in incident

4045
03:07:38,080 --> 03:07:39,520
response

4046
03:07:39,520 --> 03:07:42,080
across an ever increasing mix of system

4047
03:07:42,080 --> 03:07:44,080
application tools and layer of

4048
03:07:44,080 --> 03:07:45,439
abstraction

4049
03:07:45,439 --> 03:07:47,120
this is resulting in more and more

4050
03:07:47,120 --> 03:07:48,640
incident response and investigation

4051
03:07:48,640 --> 03:07:50,160
operation

4052
03:07:50,160 --> 03:07:53,680
of course always uh for uh c60

4053
03:07:53,680 --> 03:07:56,240
so a digital operation scale within all

4054
03:07:56,240 --> 03:07:58,160
organization one of the challenge for

4055
03:07:58,160 --> 03:08:00,800
cecil becomes ensuring the best possible

4056
03:08:00,800 --> 03:08:03,040
intervention in the face

4057
03:08:03,040 --> 03:08:05,680
of degradation and outreach

4058
03:08:05,680 --> 03:08:07,680
so they have to improve their incident

4059
03:08:07,680 --> 03:08:11,680
response for sure so here

4060
03:08:11,680 --> 03:08:13,840
i try to present for you the accident

4061
03:08:13,840 --> 03:08:18,080
response uh let's say philadelphia uh

4062
03:08:18,080 --> 03:08:20,399
to be accurately or constrained the

4063
03:08:20,399 --> 03:08:23,600
right response for every attribute

4064
03:08:23,600 --> 03:08:25,920
routine operational issues major

4065
03:08:25,920 --> 03:08:28,479
incidents and everything in between so

4066
03:08:28,479 --> 03:08:30,399
this approach is based on a past and

4067
03:08:30,399 --> 03:08:32,399
tested best practice it provides the

4068
03:08:32,399 --> 03:08:34,399
foundation for house reciprocity and

4069
03:08:34,399 --> 03:08:36,240
health organizations gone beyond just

4070
03:08:36,240 --> 03:08:39,040
paying someone to look into an issue and

4071
03:08:39,040 --> 03:08:42,240
exceed others the poor spectrum of uh

4072
03:08:42,240 --> 03:08:43,760
response needed

4073
03:08:43,760 --> 03:08:46,720
so the diagram starts on the left

4074
03:08:46,720 --> 03:08:48,080
with the beginning of an existing

4075
03:08:48,080 --> 03:08:50,000
response which is prepared so the

4076
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:51,840
preparation phase involves putting

4077
03:08:51,840 --> 03:08:53,439
culturally in place prevent accidents

4078
03:08:53,439 --> 03:08:56,240
from occurring on the network or to the

4079
03:08:56,240 --> 03:08:58,240
immunization in the first place we will

4080
03:08:58,240 --> 03:09:00,080
see that

4081
03:09:00,080 --> 03:09:02,560
it's not really the role to prepare the

4082
03:09:02,560 --> 03:09:04,240
organization but

4083
03:09:04,240 --> 03:09:07,359
uh they have a role to play so

4084
03:09:07,359 --> 03:09:09,279
at the end of uh

4085
03:09:09,279 --> 03:09:12,160
this life cycle so you see how success

4086
03:09:12,160 --> 03:09:15,520
will um prepare the organization and

4087
03:09:15,520 --> 03:09:18,720
encouraged to put some contract in it to

4088
03:09:18,720 --> 03:09:21,359
be ready to face uh

4089
03:09:21,359 --> 03:09:23,279
attacks or cyber

4090
03:09:23,279 --> 03:09:25,680
accidents tonix notice

4091
03:09:25,680 --> 03:09:28,000
how the arrow leads to the next step

4092
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:29,520
detect and

4093
03:09:29,520 --> 03:09:31,840
during this time the observed orion

4094
03:09:31,840 --> 03:09:33,359
decide and add

4095
03:09:33,359 --> 03:09:34,479
loop

4096
03:09:34,479 --> 03:09:36,000
so uh

4097
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:38,560
we say the observed oriented side and as

4098
03:09:38,560 --> 03:09:40,880
loop we call it the loop

4099
03:09:40,880 --> 03:09:43,520
so just because the cycle is on the

4100
03:09:43,520 --> 03:09:45,439
object's diagram once

4101
03:09:45,439 --> 03:09:48,160
does not mean it will only be completed

4102
03:09:48,160 --> 03:09:50,160
once during the detection phase of

4103
03:09:50,160 --> 03:09:51,760
accident response you have to know that

4104
03:09:51,760 --> 03:09:54,479
every incident is different meaning

4105
03:09:54,479 --> 03:09:56,319
each incident should be treated

4106
03:09:56,319 --> 03:09:58,080
independently

4107
03:09:58,080 --> 03:10:00,560
from the udalu contain and

4108
03:10:00,560 --> 03:10:03,439
led case are next so those files just

4109
03:10:03,439 --> 03:10:04,319
phase

4110
03:10:04,319 --> 03:10:06,720
of the lifecycle usually take longer

4111
03:10:06,720 --> 03:10:09,120
than expected so something you have to

4112
03:10:09,120 --> 03:10:11,200
know if one thing can be learned from

4113
03:10:11,200 --> 03:10:12,880
incident response

4114
03:10:12,880 --> 03:10:14,720
from our experience of course you see

4115
03:10:14,720 --> 03:10:15,680
that

4116
03:10:15,680 --> 03:10:18,160
setting a timeline or time limit on the

4117
03:10:18,160 --> 03:10:20,640
amount of work that will be put into the

4118
03:10:20,640 --> 03:10:22,080
phase

4119
03:10:22,080 --> 03:10:24,080
especially this two-phase container

4120
03:10:24,080 --> 03:10:27,120
erinicate is unpredictable so

4121
03:10:27,120 --> 03:10:30,720
we cannot predict the time that

4122
03:10:30,720 --> 03:10:32,800
we have to do to

4123
03:10:32,800 --> 03:10:35,120
invest to

4124
03:10:35,120 --> 03:10:36,720
achieve

4125
03:10:36,720 --> 03:10:39,439
the contain and educate

4126
03:10:39,439 --> 03:10:41,520
it depends on the incident it depends on

4127
03:10:41,520 --> 03:10:43,760
how much is bigger the information

4128
03:10:43,760 --> 03:10:45,600
system

4129
03:10:45,600 --> 03:10:48,800
of replying depends on a lot of things

4130
03:10:48,800 --> 03:10:49,840
that

4131
03:10:49,840 --> 03:10:53,040
make every incident

4132
03:10:53,040 --> 03:10:55,760
let's say the case of study so after

4133
03:10:55,760 --> 03:10:58,479
containing and meditating recovery have

4134
03:10:58,479 --> 03:11:00,560
left so recovery is the process of

4135
03:11:00,560 --> 03:11:03,760
uncommon signification against the acid

4136
03:11:03,760 --> 03:11:05,840
that has taken place and of course

4137
03:11:05,840 --> 03:11:07,920
making sure that the threat is fully

4138
03:11:07,920 --> 03:11:09,120
eradicated

4139
03:11:09,120 --> 03:11:12,479
so when we achieve this path we argument

4140
03:11:12,479 --> 03:11:14,880
against the prepared phase

4141
03:11:14,880 --> 03:11:17,840
so here in fact we sent

4142
03:11:17,840 --> 03:11:20,000
some recommended some recommendation in

4143
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:22,000
the report to

4144
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:24,800
the organization to prepare itself

4145
03:11:24,800 --> 03:11:26,640
and to ensure that this incident will

4146
03:11:26,640 --> 03:11:28,080
not happen again

4147
03:11:28,080 --> 03:11:29,359
so

4148
03:11:29,359 --> 03:11:30,479
the last

4149
03:11:30,479 --> 03:11:32,479
step of the finance phase it will be the

4150
03:11:32,479 --> 03:11:34,319
lesson

4151
03:11:34,319 --> 03:11:35,520
so

4152
03:11:35,520 --> 03:11:37,680
to the incident response life cycle but

4153
03:11:37,680 --> 03:11:40,720
this does not mean the world and then

4154
03:11:40,720 --> 03:11:43,040
be sure to share the recommended

4155
03:11:43,040 --> 03:11:45,040
improvements and why those improvements

4156
03:11:45,040 --> 03:11:46,800
will help to protect the network in the

4157
03:11:46,800 --> 03:11:50,560
future uh notice how the lesson learned

4158
03:11:50,560 --> 03:11:52,319
links to the beginning of the life cycle

4159
03:11:52,319 --> 03:11:54,640
diagram uh there should be constant

4160
03:11:54,640 --> 03:11:56,960
feedback between the end of one accident

4161
03:11:56,960 --> 03:11:59,600
and the potential uh beginning

4162
03:11:59,600 --> 03:12:01,520
of the other and then

4163
03:12:01,520 --> 03:12:02,479
that

4164
03:12:02,479 --> 03:12:04,960
has been shown

4165
03:12:04,960 --> 03:12:06,000
during

4166
03:12:06,000 --> 03:12:08,000
this presentation

4167
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:11,840
by the ansi team and messenger

4168
03:12:15,439 --> 03:12:16,160
so

4169
03:12:16,160 --> 03:12:19,600
as you said we have deputies to act with

4170
03:12:19,600 --> 03:12:23,439
decisions and uh accuracy to do we had

4171
03:12:23,439 --> 03:12:27,680
to prepare our mother of two first

4172
03:12:27,680 --> 03:12:30,560
and the minimum of skills let's say at

4173
03:12:30,560 --> 03:12:32,800
mastering of the schools

4174
03:12:32,800 --> 03:12:36,960
so let's start by some um organization

4175
03:12:36,960 --> 03:12:38,960
organization manner let's say

4176
03:12:38,960 --> 03:12:40,720
first of all we need

4177
03:12:40,720 --> 03:12:42,800
for sure to save evidence

4178
03:12:42,800 --> 03:12:45,760
for related forensic action so we had to

4179
03:12:45,760 --> 03:12:48,640
minimize the action taken off ideally we

4180
03:12:48,640 --> 03:12:52,800
have to take a foreign even do possible

4181
03:12:52,800 --> 03:12:55,439
of every system in the scope and it has

4182
03:12:55,439 --> 03:12:58,160
to be a perfect flaw so we use tools

4183
03:12:58,160 --> 03:13:02,319
like ethical images or vdd tools

4184
03:13:02,319 --> 03:13:03,520
personally

4185
03:13:03,520 --> 03:13:05,279
i prefer

4186
03:13:05,279 --> 03:13:07,359
ethica images which is more user

4187
03:13:07,359 --> 03:13:10,160
friendly and has a lot of supported

4188
03:13:10,160 --> 03:13:12,080
image format it could be shown during

4189
03:13:12,080 --> 03:13:13,680
the hands-on

4190
03:13:13,680 --> 03:13:14,560
lab

4191
03:13:14,560 --> 03:13:17,920
and the usc is very easy to

4192
03:13:17,920 --> 03:13:19,600
to work with

4193
03:13:19,600 --> 03:13:21,200
so

4194
03:13:21,200 --> 03:13:23,840
we also have to take the raw memory

4195
03:13:23,840 --> 03:13:26,399
it depends on the system you have and

4196
03:13:26,399 --> 03:13:28,080
there is a lot of tools for every system

4197
03:13:28,080 --> 03:13:30,880
for example requiring a windows system

4198
03:13:30,880 --> 03:13:33,680
we can use imaginator capture

4199
03:13:33,680 --> 03:13:35,760
it's not only the one

4200
03:13:35,760 --> 03:13:38,319
it is but it's free it's downloadable

4201
03:13:38,319 --> 03:13:40,399
and you will get it immediately without

4202
03:13:40,399 --> 03:13:43,200
waiting for approval because many tools

4203
03:13:43,200 --> 03:13:44,160
when you

4204
03:13:44,160 --> 03:13:46,080
fulfill the

4205
03:13:46,080 --> 03:13:48,720
let's say the download form so

4206
03:13:48,720 --> 03:13:50,880
you have to wait for an improvement to

4207
03:13:50,880 --> 03:13:52,560
give you the right of the lead to

4208
03:13:52,560 --> 03:13:54,960
download so these tools you can download

4209
03:13:54,960 --> 03:13:56,960
it

4210
03:13:56,960 --> 03:14:00,399
now once our clone is ready and we will

4211
03:14:00,399 --> 03:14:03,040
talk about making clones before start

4212
03:14:03,040 --> 03:14:04,960
investigating or

4213
03:14:04,960 --> 03:14:06,000
start

4214
03:14:06,000 --> 03:14:08,960
the accident response but for the moment

4215
03:14:08,960 --> 03:14:10,800
now once our product is ready we can

4216
03:14:10,800 --> 03:14:13,200
start collecting evidence from the clone

4217
03:14:13,200 --> 03:14:15,279
or directly from the machine attracted

4218
03:14:15,279 --> 03:14:16,399
to the fan

4219
03:14:16,399 --> 03:14:18,399
even if i don't recommend in some

4220
03:14:18,399 --> 03:14:21,039
situation

4221
03:14:21,359 --> 03:14:23,600
and with the pressure to recover as fast

4222
03:14:23,600 --> 03:14:25,359
as possible taking loans can be

4223
03:14:25,359 --> 03:14:28,239
extremely annoying i know that uh from

4224
03:14:28,239 --> 03:14:30,479
experience but

4225
03:14:30,479 --> 03:14:33,200
if you will if you like to work

4226
03:14:33,200 --> 03:14:36,720
um correctly we had to take loan before

4227
03:14:36,720 --> 03:14:38,800
starting

4228
03:14:38,800 --> 03:14:40,239
analyzing the

4229
03:14:40,239 --> 03:14:42,560
machine and then we can present the

4230
03:14:42,560 --> 03:14:46,479
evidence for uh later use for example uh

4231
03:14:46,479 --> 03:14:48,800
inside the court

4232
03:14:48,800 --> 03:14:51,359
so to do latias

4233
03:14:51,359 --> 03:14:53,439
we had some tools that can do that

4234
03:14:53,439 --> 03:14:55,040
automatically

4235
03:14:55,040 --> 03:14:56,399
it wasn't before

4236
03:14:56,399 --> 03:14:58,319
a couple of years so we have to collect

4237
03:14:58,319 --> 03:15:01,359
the existence manually but now

4238
03:15:01,359 --> 03:15:03,200
we can slam those tools and collect

4239
03:15:03,200 --> 03:15:06,319
persistent evidence directly for example

4240
03:15:06,319 --> 03:15:08,800
is a multi-function program that

4241
03:15:08,800 --> 03:15:09,920
primarily

4242
03:15:09,920 --> 03:15:12,560
collect file and process connected file

4243
03:15:12,560 --> 03:15:15,120
with one or more program so

4244
03:15:15,120 --> 03:15:17,600
in case reconfiguration file

4245
03:15:17,600 --> 03:15:21,120
on the fly we see it during the lab also

4246
03:15:21,120 --> 03:15:23,040
and based on the contact

4247
03:15:23,040 --> 03:15:25,120
content

4248
03:15:25,120 --> 03:15:27,279
he will collect and process relevant

4249
03:15:27,279 --> 03:15:30,239
files this makes case very responsible

4250
03:15:30,239 --> 03:15:33,120
uh as we say later in the last case used

4251
03:15:33,120 --> 03:15:35,680
the concept of target and noodle to do

4252
03:15:35,680 --> 03:15:37,120
its work

4253
03:15:37,120 --> 03:15:39,520
and also case come with the rise of

4254
03:15:39,520 --> 03:15:42,399
default target and noodle for operation

4255
03:15:42,399 --> 03:15:45,680
must come from only uh requirement in

4256
03:15:45,680 --> 03:15:46,800
financing

4257
03:15:46,800 --> 03:15:49,520
exam the next phase will be

4258
03:15:49,520 --> 03:15:51,920
analyzing faith

4259
03:15:51,920 --> 03:15:53,200
now

4260
03:15:53,200 --> 03:15:55,200
we start passing evidence and

4261
03:15:55,200 --> 03:15:57,600
understanding the case of course we

4262
03:15:57,600 --> 03:15:59,520
still have to manually anticipate the

4263
03:15:59,520 --> 03:16:01,920
artifacts collected but those students

4264
03:16:01,920 --> 03:16:04,640
we have a lot for classifying and

4265
03:16:04,640 --> 03:16:08,080
organize the information inside

4266
03:16:09,120 --> 03:16:11,279
don't forget that

4267
03:16:11,279 --> 03:16:13,200
those artifacts will be a lot of

4268
03:16:13,200 --> 03:16:14,399
gigabytes

4269
03:16:14,399 --> 03:16:16,560
without those tools investigating will

4270
03:16:16,560 --> 03:16:18,960
become hellish

4271
03:16:18,960 --> 03:16:21,439
and when this this phase is done

4272
03:16:21,439 --> 03:16:24,479
uh in many cases it will

4273
03:16:24,479 --> 03:16:27,359
it return let's say into malware

4274
03:16:27,359 --> 03:16:29,680
so also there is a lot of tools that we

4275
03:16:29,680 --> 03:16:32,000
will try to see

4276
03:16:32,000 --> 03:16:34,880
we will try to see in the last

4277
03:16:34,880 --> 03:16:37,120
time just remember

4278
03:16:37,120 --> 03:16:39,680
malware reverse is hellish so

4279
03:16:39,680 --> 03:16:42,479
those tools will just help us to extract

4280
03:16:42,479 --> 03:16:44,640
some indicator of compromise and

4281
03:16:44,640 --> 03:16:47,600
understanding the basis behavior of

4282
03:16:47,600 --> 03:16:50,080
the malware but they will not turn into

4283
03:16:50,080 --> 03:16:51,120
a real

4284
03:16:51,120 --> 03:16:53,920
request we need this to maybe another

4285
03:16:53,920 --> 03:16:55,200
session

4286
03:16:55,200 --> 03:16:59,800
and for sure for antivirus editor

4287
03:17:01,680 --> 03:17:03,520
malware shall not be a part of the

4288
03:17:03,520 --> 03:17:05,920
investigation but we do it anyway it's

4289
03:17:05,920 --> 03:17:08,319
just a little bit and it's not a piece

4290
03:17:08,319 --> 03:17:10,560
of evidence to extract the iuc indicator

4291
03:17:10,560 --> 03:17:12,720
of compromise and we shall stop

4292
03:17:12,720 --> 03:17:14,160
debugging

4293
03:17:14,160 --> 03:17:16,960
a malware it's really hard and

4294
03:17:16,960 --> 03:17:18,560
may need a really advanced skills

4295
03:17:18,560 --> 03:17:20,160
depending on

4296
03:17:20,160 --> 03:17:21,920
the many layers of protection and

4297
03:17:21,920 --> 03:17:24,080
anti-debugging mechanism

4298
03:17:24,080 --> 03:17:26,640
implemented on it so

4299
03:17:26,640 --> 03:17:29,040
we do just a little bit to

4300
03:17:29,040 --> 03:17:31,439
understand the behavior of

4301
03:17:31,439 --> 03:17:34,000
this malware

4302
03:17:37,359 --> 03:17:38,160
so

4303
03:17:38,160 --> 03:17:40,960
here we start by uh talking a little bit

4304
03:17:40,960 --> 03:17:43,840
about the tools that we will uh see and

4305
03:17:43,840 --> 03:17:46,720
the tools that we can use during the

4306
03:17:46,720 --> 03:17:49,279
investigation so we start by the famous

4307
03:17:49,279 --> 03:17:50,080
uh

4308
03:17:50,080 --> 03:17:52,720
autopsy

4309
03:17:52,960 --> 03:17:54,800
they say why is the chief office first

4310
03:17:54,800 --> 03:17:57,439
digital parasite platform uh that is

4311
03:17:57,439 --> 03:17:59,840
anything but difficult to utilize that's

4312
03:17:59,840 --> 03:18:01,760
nice for because you really was

4313
03:18:01,760 --> 03:18:05,359
apparently quick and usable in every uh

4314
03:18:05,359 --> 03:18:08,239
let's say a cyber examination it

4315
03:18:08,239 --> 03:18:10,960
analyzed hard drives smartphones media

4316
03:18:10,960 --> 03:18:12,640
cards

4317
03:18:12,640 --> 03:18:14,640
it's primarily developed for meters of

4318
03:18:14,640 --> 03:18:15,760
windows

4319
03:18:15,760 --> 03:18:17,200
but

4320
03:18:17,200 --> 03:18:19,279
it can work also and

4321
03:18:19,279 --> 03:18:22,000
on linux and mac os there is a minimal

4322
03:18:22,000 --> 03:18:24,319
support for that

4323
03:18:24,319 --> 03:18:27,279
in the lab also we will focus on

4324
03:18:27,279 --> 03:18:30,319
overview of autopsy cases data source so

4325
03:18:30,319 --> 03:18:31,920
just wait for it

4326
03:18:31,920 --> 03:18:34,160
even if you can install it on an

4327
03:18:34,160 --> 03:18:36,880
impacted machine again it would be good

4328
03:18:36,880 --> 03:18:38,720
to remember that installing software on

4329
03:18:38,720 --> 03:18:40,319
a negative machine should be really

4330
03:18:40,319 --> 03:18:43,359
restricted and documented when it's done

4331
03:18:43,359 --> 03:18:46,239
so it's better to use autopsy on

4332
03:18:46,239 --> 03:18:50,080
investigation machine fire and just join

4333
03:18:50,080 --> 03:18:52,640
a copy clone or

4334
03:18:52,640 --> 03:18:55,760
an external disk to be analyzed by

4335
03:18:55,760 --> 03:18:58,479
autopsy try to not install directly

4336
03:18:58,479 --> 03:19:00,160
autopsy on the infected machine or the

4337
03:19:00,160 --> 03:19:05,160
impacted machine to collect evidence

4338
03:19:07,680 --> 03:19:10,800
okay here also some add-ons

4339
03:19:10,800 --> 03:19:12,399
these are those uh

4340
03:19:12,399 --> 03:19:14,239
used also by

4341
03:19:14,239 --> 03:19:17,680
autopsy can make some existing so to

4342
03:19:17,680 --> 03:19:20,000
analyze the foreign language and search

4343
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:23,200
for keywords also for twitter this is

4344
03:19:23,200 --> 03:19:25,120
very useful uh

4345
03:19:25,120 --> 03:19:25,840
to

4346
03:19:25,840 --> 03:19:28,560
to to make the video viewable

4347
03:19:28,560 --> 03:19:31,120
handmade image so you can you can

4348
03:19:31,120 --> 03:19:34,800
just see what video

4349
03:19:34,800 --> 03:19:36,720
are you interested in

4350
03:19:36,720 --> 03:19:38,000
uh

4351
03:19:38,000 --> 03:19:42,040
we continue with the slash kit so

4352
03:19:42,040 --> 03:19:44,880
business is a collection of command line

4353
03:19:44,880 --> 03:19:48,560
tools let's say and see libraries a lot

4354
03:19:48,560 --> 03:19:50,080
of library

4355
03:19:50,080 --> 03:19:53,120
that allow you to analyze this image and

4356
03:19:53,120 --> 03:19:55,520
recover files from them

4357
03:19:55,520 --> 03:19:58,080
it uses generally behind the scene for

4358
03:19:58,080 --> 03:20:00,560
example in autopsy and many other open

4359
03:20:00,560 --> 03:20:04,239
source and commercial tools also

4360
03:20:04,239 --> 03:20:05,120
so

4361
03:20:05,120 --> 03:20:06,640
uh

4362
03:20:06,640 --> 03:20:09,760
the first keys can be used in two ways

4363
03:20:09,760 --> 03:20:12,840
the c library or the the

4364
03:20:12,840 --> 03:20:14,080
library uh

4365
03:20:14,080 --> 03:20:17,279
made it in slaves can be incorporated

4366
03:20:17,279 --> 03:20:18,560
into larger

4367
03:20:18,560 --> 03:20:20,720
digital processing tools like autopsy

4368
03:20:20,720 --> 03:20:21,840
for example

4369
03:20:21,840 --> 03:20:23,680
and the command line tools can be used

4370
03:20:23,680 --> 03:20:26,160
directly by the user but

4371
03:20:26,160 --> 03:20:29,600
it's a little bit hard to to manipulate

4372
03:20:29,600 --> 03:20:32,239
in fact uh i made

4373
03:20:32,239 --> 03:20:35,120
this on mega.mv

4374
03:20:35,120 --> 03:20:37,600
that you can find all those tools so i

4375
03:20:37,600 --> 03:20:39,200
will share the link after that with mr

4376
03:20:39,200 --> 03:20:42,000
nabil and he will send it to you

4377
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:43,920
so you can download all the tools and

4378
03:20:43,920 --> 03:20:46,399
the machine that you will see

4379
03:20:46,399 --> 03:20:48,960
during the lab

4380
03:20:48,960 --> 03:20:50,800
so this kit is a little bit complex to

4381
03:20:50,800 --> 03:20:53,279
use like i said

4382
03:20:53,279 --> 03:20:56,479
measure case we use autopsy with certain

4383
03:20:56,479 --> 03:20:58,479
who who use

4384
03:20:58,479 --> 03:21:01,040
flat keys library with a

4385
03:21:01,040 --> 03:21:03,359
graphic user interface

4386
03:21:03,359 --> 03:21:06,640
so it's it's easy to use it's more easy

4387
03:21:06,640 --> 03:21:08,399
to use than

4388
03:21:08,399 --> 03:21:11,840
flat directly

4389
03:21:14,479 --> 03:21:17,920
okay now another tool that is really uh

4390
03:21:17,920 --> 03:21:19,920
interesting is uh

4391
03:21:19,920 --> 03:21:21,760
so material

4392
03:21:21,760 --> 03:21:24,399
offer meaning for gathering information

4393
03:21:24,399 --> 03:21:26,560
about company or person

4394
03:21:26,560 --> 03:21:28,800
you offer broadly two types of

4395
03:21:28,800 --> 03:21:30,640
reconnaissance option

4396
03:21:30,640 --> 03:21:33,840
namely infrastructural and personal

4397
03:21:33,840 --> 03:21:36,319
for infrastructure mechanisms deal with

4398
03:21:36,319 --> 03:21:38,880
the mind covering dns information

4399
03:21:38,880 --> 03:21:41,359
such as nail server mail exchanges and

4400
03:21:41,359 --> 03:21:44,720
transfer table dns to ep mapping and

4401
03:21:44,720 --> 03:21:46,880
related information for personal

4402
03:21:46,880 --> 03:21:49,520
reconnaissance on the other hand include

4403
03:21:49,520 --> 03:21:52,239
personal information email address phone

4404
03:21:52,239 --> 03:21:55,040
number social network profile uh midwest

4405
03:21:55,040 --> 03:21:57,600
nice connection and so on so this helps

4406
03:21:57,600 --> 03:21:59,840
for the information gathering phase of

4407
03:21:59,840 --> 03:22:02,800
all the security related work so in fact

4408
03:22:02,800 --> 03:22:05,120
discovering the hidden information in

4409
03:22:05,120 --> 03:22:07,760
the same way there is another

4410
03:22:07,760 --> 03:22:08,880
tool

4411
03:22:08,880 --> 03:22:12,000
also called opencti his goal is to

4412
03:22:12,000 --> 03:22:13,279
create

4413
03:22:13,279 --> 03:22:16,960
let's say a comprehensive tool along

4414
03:22:16,960 --> 03:22:18,479
users

4415
03:22:18,479 --> 03:22:20,160
to capabilize technical and

4416
03:22:20,160 --> 03:22:22,160
non-technical information

4417
03:22:22,160 --> 03:22:24,160
uh while linking each piece of

4418
03:22:24,160 --> 03:22:26,640
affirmation with primary source for

4419
03:22:26,640 --> 03:22:28,160
example the

4420
03:22:28,160 --> 03:22:29,920
missed event

4421
03:22:29,920 --> 03:22:32,000
with features as a

4422
03:22:32,000 --> 03:22:34,479
link between each information field and

4423
03:22:34,479 --> 03:22:37,040
last three days level of confidence

4424
03:22:37,040 --> 03:22:38,080
etcetera

4425
03:22:38,080 --> 03:22:40,800
so the tools is able to use

4426
03:22:40,800 --> 03:22:43,279
the metrata framework also

4427
03:22:43,279 --> 03:22:46,479
to help structure the data

4428
03:22:46,479 --> 03:22:48,239
the user can also choose to implement

4429
03:22:48,239 --> 03:22:49,279
their own

4430
03:22:49,279 --> 03:22:50,640
dataset

4431
03:22:50,640 --> 03:22:51,520
so

4432
03:22:51,520 --> 03:22:54,080
once the data has been capitalized and

4433
03:22:54,080 --> 03:22:57,359
processed by the analyst within opcca

4434
03:22:57,359 --> 03:22:59,840
new relation may be as held from

4435
03:22:59,840 --> 03:23:01,359
existing one

4436
03:23:01,359 --> 03:23:04,160
the understanding and the representation

4437
03:23:04,160 --> 03:23:06,800
of this supplement this allows you to

4438
03:23:06,800 --> 03:23:08,960
extract as leverage made for knowledge

4439
03:23:08,960 --> 03:23:12,080
from the raw data so you can for example

4440
03:23:12,080 --> 03:23:13,040
just

4441
03:23:13,040 --> 03:23:16,399
try it as dmood.opencci that you i will

4442
03:23:16,399 --> 03:23:17,920
try to

4443
03:23:17,920 --> 03:23:20,960
send to you the link

4444
03:23:20,960 --> 03:23:25,080
on the chat right now

4445
03:23:33,760 --> 03:23:36,399
so you can you can just log in

4446
03:23:36,399 --> 03:23:37,359
uh

4447
03:23:37,359 --> 03:23:39,680
with your gmail account for example

4448
03:23:39,680 --> 03:23:40,880
and

4449
03:23:40,880 --> 03:23:42,560
you have to know that

4450
03:23:42,560 --> 03:23:45,040
you will get only the demo so it's not

4451
03:23:45,040 --> 03:23:48,239
really the whole affirmation uh that he

4452
03:23:48,239 --> 03:23:51,600
can take so uh i will show you also

4453
03:23:51,600 --> 03:23:54,479
uh just here

4454
03:23:55,520 --> 03:23:56,640
you have to

4455
03:23:56,640 --> 03:23:59,640
china

4456
03:24:04,720 --> 03:24:06,080
okay for you

4457
03:24:06,080 --> 03:24:10,399
he will ask you to log in with your

4458
03:24:10,399 --> 03:24:11,600
google

4459
03:24:11,600 --> 03:24:13,680
so please do it because it's a really

4460
03:24:13,680 --> 03:24:15,120
powerful tools

4461
03:24:15,120 --> 03:24:18,560
so we can go directly i will not uh

4462
03:24:18,560 --> 03:24:21,600
explain the whole option um

4463
03:24:21,600 --> 03:24:22,720
in the

4464
03:24:22,720 --> 03:24:24,880
shared disk that i received

4465
03:24:24,880 --> 03:24:27,600
as i said to mr nevis so you found

4466
03:24:27,600 --> 03:24:29,840
a tutorial about how installing and

4467
03:24:29,840 --> 03:24:30,880
using

4468
03:24:30,880 --> 03:24:33,040
obviously but now for the moment

4469
03:24:33,040 --> 03:24:34,160
i wish you

4470
03:24:34,160 --> 03:24:38,080
just some uh great function

4471
03:24:38,080 --> 03:24:41,359
for example here we can go directly to

4472
03:24:41,359 --> 03:24:42,880
the credits list

4473
03:24:42,880 --> 03:24:45,680
and here you can see a list of threads

4474
03:24:45,680 --> 03:24:46,800
of course when

4475
03:24:46,800 --> 03:24:48,960
really unsigned on your

4476
03:24:48,960 --> 03:24:50,640
system you will

4477
03:24:50,640 --> 03:24:53,920
grant a lot of other information uh you

4478
03:24:53,920 --> 03:24:56,239
can configure from here from data you

4479
03:24:56,239 --> 03:24:58,880
can compute the servers that

4480
03:24:58,880 --> 03:25:02,560
will be used by office api to grab data

4481
03:25:02,560 --> 03:25:05,200
as you can see you can use the means and

4482
03:25:05,200 --> 03:25:09,120
use a lot of independent

4483
03:25:09,600 --> 03:25:12,319
information source you can use also

4484
03:25:12,319 --> 03:25:15,840
using modules using framework to grab

4485
03:25:15,840 --> 03:25:17,120
data and

4486
03:25:17,120 --> 03:25:20,880
pass it in your entity so as i said we

4487
03:25:20,880 --> 03:25:23,039
go

4488
03:25:28,880 --> 03:25:30,239
so we can get

4489
03:25:30,239 --> 03:25:33,279
a lot of confirmation about this

4490
03:25:33,279 --> 03:25:35,279
after but

4491
03:25:35,279 --> 03:25:37,520
something is really uh

4492
03:25:37,520 --> 03:25:39,359
interesting it's

4493
03:25:39,359 --> 03:25:40,399
uh

4494
03:25:40,399 --> 03:25:42,640
we have to know we can

4495
03:25:42,640 --> 03:25:43,920
know directly

4496
03:25:43,920 --> 03:25:46,880
the last relation created for example

4497
03:25:46,880 --> 03:25:48,960
the pattern of attack the vulnerability

4498
03:25:48,960 --> 03:25:50,960
used by the screw

4499
03:25:50,960 --> 03:25:54,319
another pattern attached so it give us a

4500
03:25:54,319 --> 03:25:57,279
lot of information so we go to

4501
03:25:57,279 --> 03:26:00,399
go through and have

4502
03:26:01,279 --> 03:26:03,439
let's say a lot of information related

4503
03:26:03,439 --> 03:26:08,160
to this after we go to knowledge

4504
03:26:08,560 --> 03:26:11,040
and here we have for example

4505
03:26:11,040 --> 03:26:12,720
320

4506
03:26:12,720 --> 03:26:16,160
i can attack 88

4507
03:26:16,160 --> 03:26:18,479
malicious code school uses

4508
03:26:18,479 --> 03:26:23,920
uh group uh also they identified 36 30

4509
03:26:23,920 --> 03:26:27,840
sex uh tools used by this group they uh

4510
03:26:27,840 --> 03:26:31,680
attacked it in total 31

4511
03:26:45,200 --> 03:26:49,760
defense diplomacy energy finance but if

4512
03:26:49,760 --> 03:26:51,439
this group try to attack everything

4513
03:26:51,439 --> 03:26:54,880
because it's related to a nation

4514
03:26:54,880 --> 03:26:57,120
here we can go to see

4515
03:26:57,120 --> 03:27:00,800
with the after uh

4516
03:27:00,800 --> 03:27:03,210
in relation with this group

4517
03:27:03,210 --> 03:27:04,560
[Music]

4518
03:27:04,560 --> 03:27:08,640
the pattern of attack they use

4519
03:27:08,640 --> 03:27:11,359
if there is some

4520
03:27:11,359 --> 03:27:14,560
active campaign which is here we can go

4521
03:27:14,560 --> 03:27:15,359
to

4522
03:27:15,359 --> 03:27:18,319
uh but then attack to understand

4523
03:27:18,319 --> 03:27:20,800
uh what would they use

4524
03:27:20,800 --> 03:27:22,720
so here we see

4525
03:27:22,720 --> 03:27:24,880
as you can see it's

4526
03:27:24,880 --> 03:27:28,720
the meter framework and for every phase

4527
03:27:28,720 --> 03:27:30,479
they give us

4528
03:27:30,479 --> 03:27:32,720
what kind of

4529
03:27:32,720 --> 03:27:35,279
techniques they use so for example if we

4530
03:27:35,279 --> 03:27:37,920
see in the execution

4531
03:27:37,920 --> 03:27:39,600
the most using

4532
03:27:39,600 --> 03:27:41,600
technique is that command and switching

4533
03:27:41,600 --> 03:27:43,760
and separators so they use a lot of of

4534
03:27:43,760 --> 03:27:47,760
scripts with powershell

4535
03:27:47,760 --> 03:27:51,439
they use it to to execute their malware

4536
03:27:51,439 --> 03:27:55,040
and execute the exploit it could be any

4537
03:27:55,040 --> 03:27:58,960
one of those but the most used one

4538
03:27:58,960 --> 03:28:01,120
so we can see also related to

4539
03:28:01,120 --> 03:28:03,279
the patches so the technique used to

4540
03:28:03,279 --> 03:28:05,680
make the assistant uh

4541
03:28:05,680 --> 03:28:08,560
i'm picturing so they use the boot or

4542
03:28:08,560 --> 03:28:10,720
logon for the start execution

4543
03:28:10,720 --> 03:28:12,720
or account manipulation technique or

4544
03:28:12,720 --> 03:28:15,600
they will eventually a new account they

4545
03:28:15,600 --> 03:28:17,359
can also create or meditate system

4546
03:28:17,359 --> 03:28:19,200
process so

4547
03:28:19,200 --> 03:28:20,960
those techniques are used

4548
03:28:20,960 --> 03:28:22,720
by uh

4549
03:28:22,720 --> 03:28:26,000
to make the malware efficient also for

4550
03:28:26,000 --> 03:28:28,000
the privileged escalation the defensive

4551
03:28:28,000 --> 03:28:29,840
and this is very useful

4552
03:28:29,840 --> 03:28:32,160
because when we have a pattern we can go

4553
03:28:32,160 --> 03:28:34,640
here and when we see that the initial

4554
03:28:34,640 --> 03:28:36,560
aspects were made by fishing attack

4555
03:28:36,560 --> 03:28:40,080
after that we found a lot of script

4556
03:28:40,080 --> 03:28:42,560
powershell of the display and after that

4557
03:28:42,560 --> 03:28:45,359
we can for example uh found that there

4558
03:28:45,359 --> 03:28:46,080
is

4559
03:28:46,080 --> 03:28:48,239
an autostart execution made from the

4560
03:28:48,239 --> 03:28:50,560
system

4561
03:28:50,560 --> 03:28:52,399
and during the analysis we found that

4562
03:28:52,399 --> 03:28:55,200
race for clinical escalation for example

4563
03:28:55,200 --> 03:28:57,760
uh boot or logan or services so we can

4564
03:28:57,760 --> 03:28:59,680
relate directly

4565
03:28:59,680 --> 03:29:02,720
attached to this group and after that

4566
03:29:02,720 --> 03:29:04,800
we can read about this look we can take

4567
03:29:04,800 --> 03:29:06,800
a lot of information about this loop and

4568
03:29:06,800 --> 03:29:08,720
when we propose the recommendations to

4569
03:29:08,720 --> 03:29:11,840
contain the incident we can uh

4570
03:29:11,840 --> 03:29:14,720
take care of a lot of vectors of attack

4571
03:29:14,720 --> 03:29:17,439
user cybersphere so we will not only

4572
03:29:17,439 --> 03:29:22,080
focus on what we see but also what other

4573
03:29:22,080 --> 03:29:23,120
actors

4574
03:29:23,120 --> 03:29:26,399
or other sisters have expressed and

4575
03:29:26,399 --> 03:29:29,960
share with us

4576
03:29:42,560 --> 03:29:44,960
so we continue also there is a lot of

4577
03:29:44,960 --> 03:29:47,760
distribution use it

4578
03:29:47,760 --> 03:29:48,640
to

4579
03:29:48,640 --> 03:29:50,479
help investigators

4580
03:29:50,479 --> 03:29:53,040
do work so i will not take a lot of time

4581
03:29:53,040 --> 03:29:55,120
explaining this one but there is a

4582
03:29:55,120 --> 03:29:57,520
digital

4583
03:30:01,040 --> 03:30:03,439
and foreign framework especially for

4584
03:30:03,439 --> 03:30:05,120
forensic and

4585
03:30:05,120 --> 03:30:07,439
evidence gathering

4586
03:30:07,439 --> 03:30:08,640
work on

4587
03:30:08,640 --> 03:30:11,120
windows and linux roles

4588
03:30:11,120 --> 03:30:13,279
so also there is this slide distribution

4589
03:30:13,279 --> 03:30:14,080
there

4590
03:30:14,080 --> 03:30:16,160
which is a distribution that contain a

4591
03:30:16,160 --> 03:30:19,120
lot of tools that help also to make

4592
03:30:19,120 --> 03:30:22,000
investigations uh on uh

4593
03:30:22,000 --> 03:30:23,359
windows and

4594
03:30:23,359 --> 03:30:25,600
linux it's really you can download it

4595
03:30:25,600 --> 03:30:28,640
directly so also the sensor execute make

4596
03:30:28,640 --> 03:30:31,640
uh

4597
03:30:43,200 --> 03:30:45,840
different machine workstation tools and

4598
03:30:45,840 --> 03:30:48,080
then you can use it

4599
03:30:48,080 --> 03:30:50,720
there is also this tool scheme

4600
03:30:50,720 --> 03:30:52,640
of but it's still

4601
03:30:52,640 --> 03:30:54,319
a good

4602
03:30:54,319 --> 03:30:56,720
distribution to use

4603
03:30:56,720 --> 03:30:58,479
lengthwise also

4604
03:30:58,479 --> 03:31:00,720
it's not really for

4605
03:31:00,720 --> 03:31:03,840
let's say extension uh

4606
03:31:03,840 --> 03:31:05,760
investigator

4607
03:31:05,760 --> 03:31:08,960
let's say he can collect some basic

4608
03:31:08,960 --> 03:31:10,319
evidence

4609
03:31:10,319 --> 03:31:12,720
called plastic for example

4610
03:31:12,720 --> 03:31:14,080
physical memory

4611
03:31:14,080 --> 03:31:16,239
usb storage information

4612
03:31:16,239 --> 03:31:19,600
uh internet history

4613
03:31:19,600 --> 03:31:22,960
and there is also much more so

4614
03:31:22,960 --> 03:31:24,840
just make it serious on

4615
03:31:24,840 --> 03:31:28,880
google on sourcebox or on github about

4616
03:31:28,880 --> 03:31:31,840
investigation tools and useful a lot of

4617
03:31:31,840 --> 03:31:33,920
distribution and a lot of tools to help

4618
03:31:33,920 --> 03:31:34,880
you

4619
03:31:34,880 --> 03:31:36,000
with that

4620
03:31:36,000 --> 03:31:38,080
so also it can be useful

4621
03:31:38,080 --> 03:31:39,040
to

4622
03:31:39,040 --> 03:31:41,840
scan some time you will find some

4623
03:31:41,840 --> 03:31:45,040
application and you could not find the

4624
03:31:45,040 --> 03:31:47,279
evidence that that happens

4625
03:31:47,279 --> 03:31:51,120
it can be for example some system

4626
03:31:51,120 --> 03:31:54,880
that contains a misconfiguration and

4627
03:31:54,880 --> 03:31:57,120
did not preserve

4628
03:31:57,120 --> 03:31:58,960
the log of the

4629
03:31:58,960 --> 03:32:00,319
the race

4630
03:32:00,319 --> 03:32:02,239
so we cannot

4631
03:32:02,239 --> 03:32:05,279
work on the event windows for snapple or

4632
03:32:05,279 --> 03:32:07,200
on the log system to understand what

4633
03:32:07,200 --> 03:32:09,120
happened so

4634
03:32:09,120 --> 03:32:11,439
but we have the the

4635
03:32:11,439 --> 03:32:12,479
option

4636
03:32:12,479 --> 03:32:13,200
to

4637
03:32:13,200 --> 03:32:16,399
audit the application present and those

4638
03:32:16,399 --> 03:32:18,560
system and

4639
03:32:18,560 --> 03:32:23,039
depending on what vulnerability that is

4640
03:32:35,040 --> 03:32:37,200
for java but it has some plugin to

4641
03:32:37,200 --> 03:32:39,520
support the language

4642
03:32:39,520 --> 03:32:41,840
and of course there is a lot other tools

4643
03:32:41,840 --> 03:32:44,720
that uh which lands the code and

4644
03:32:44,720 --> 03:32:48,599
he will determine the bug

4645
03:32:48,840 --> 03:32:51,840
so i believe we start

4646
03:32:51,840 --> 03:32:54,720
our hands-on

4647
03:32:54,720 --> 03:32:58,760
so i will share with you

4648
03:33:22,640 --> 03:33:25,040
could we uh extend a little bit of the

4649
03:33:25,040 --> 03:33:27,680
session or

4650
03:33:28,800 --> 03:33:32,000
i think no ohms can you hear me um yeah

4651
03:33:32,000 --> 03:33:34,239
we can a little bit i just want to

4652
03:33:34,239 --> 03:33:36,160
probably ask the attendees if the time

4653
03:33:36,160 --> 03:33:38,319
works okay thanks

4654
03:33:38,319 --> 03:33:40,000
okay great so

4655
03:33:40,000 --> 03:33:41,920
go ahead but rapidly i mean

4656
03:33:41,920 --> 03:33:47,560
okay okay i will try to tell you

4657
03:33:57,200 --> 03:33:59,359
as i said before so presenting the

4658
03:33:59,359 --> 03:34:01,600
memory for that for example for windows

4659
03:34:01,600 --> 03:34:04,399
you can use the mcs tools so uh i have

4660
03:34:04,399 --> 03:34:06,880
to tell you that the whole distribution

4661
03:34:06,880 --> 03:34:08,479
would be shared with you with this

4662
03:34:08,479 --> 03:34:10,960
provisioning

4663
03:34:10,960 --> 03:34:13,520
for investigation so this tool is ready

4664
03:34:13,520 --> 03:34:15,439
to use so

4665
03:34:15,439 --> 03:34:17,600
this is the one tool that video are

4666
03:34:17,600 --> 03:34:20,000
allowed to put on the affected machine

4667
03:34:20,000 --> 03:34:22,399
so you can put it and when it works you

4668
03:34:22,399 --> 03:34:25,520
can directly grab for you

4669
03:34:25,520 --> 03:34:28,319
the capture of your lab so click on

4670
03:34:28,319 --> 03:34:30,720
browse

4671
03:34:31,520 --> 03:34:32,960
for example here

4672
03:34:32,960 --> 03:34:35,919
you know this stuff

4673
03:34:40,160 --> 03:34:43,160
anyway

4674
03:34:53,279 --> 03:34:56,640
now we can start dante

4675
03:34:56,640 --> 03:34:59,040
our memory on this

4676
03:34:59,040 --> 03:35:01,359
on this file okay i will let you

4677
03:35:01,359 --> 03:35:04,319
do his job but now in fact he will

4678
03:35:04,319 --> 03:35:06,080
directly

4679
03:35:06,080 --> 03:35:07,840
dance the memory the

4680
03:35:07,840 --> 03:35:10,640
memory into this file but

4681
03:35:10,640 --> 03:35:12,800
in fact i did

4682
03:35:12,800 --> 03:35:14,640
another dance this one so we will work

4683
03:35:14,640 --> 03:35:18,560
on it we will not wait for that

4684
03:35:20,239 --> 03:35:21,840
so when we have

4685
03:35:21,840 --> 03:35:25,040
our example run so we will analyze it

4686
03:35:25,040 --> 03:35:27,200
through for example a tool called

4687
03:35:27,200 --> 03:35:30,160
volatility here in fact volatility is

4688
03:35:30,160 --> 03:35:32,880
stated on command line interface so we

4689
03:35:32,880 --> 03:35:34,080
found a

4690
03:35:34,080 --> 03:35:36,319
graphic interface for creativity and we

4691
03:35:36,319 --> 03:35:38,560
installed it directly

4692
03:35:38,560 --> 03:35:41,520
on this distribution so when we share

4693
03:35:41,520 --> 03:35:43,520
the distribution review with you so you

4694
03:35:43,520 --> 03:35:47,640
can use the same

4695
03:36:05,359 --> 03:36:09,520
okay so now we have just to

4696
03:36:10,000 --> 03:36:13,200
given the links directly to the password

4697
03:36:13,200 --> 03:36:14,880
our dance plan

4698
03:36:14,880 --> 03:36:17,920
you will automatically know that this

4699
03:36:17,920 --> 03:36:20,399
memory dance is for windows of course

4700
03:36:20,399 --> 03:36:22,960
we can support linux system macos system

4701
03:36:22,960 --> 03:36:25,040
also here we can choose the command that

4702
03:36:25,040 --> 03:36:26,319
we need

4703
03:36:26,319 --> 03:36:27,359
and

4704
03:36:27,359 --> 03:36:29,920
for example

4705
03:36:29,920 --> 03:36:33,800
we ask for information

4706
03:36:36,239 --> 03:36:38,800
so and now the command is running and is

4707
03:36:38,800 --> 03:36:41,359
analyzing there are five

4708
03:36:41,359 --> 03:36:43,680
to give us some information and this is

4709
03:36:43,680 --> 03:36:44,880
very useful

4710
03:36:44,880 --> 03:36:48,960
especially when we face a malware

4711
03:36:48,960 --> 03:36:52,319
so i will not wait for that

4712
03:36:53,040 --> 03:36:54,960
other tools that we can use also as i

4713
03:36:54,960 --> 03:36:57,040
said so

4714
03:36:57,040 --> 03:37:01,040
we can use the articast images to

4715
03:37:01,040 --> 03:37:03,680
flown of the dislike we said before for

4716
03:37:03,680 --> 03:37:05,200
instance amazing is one of the most

4717
03:37:05,200 --> 03:37:07,279
crucial steps involved in digital

4718
03:37:07,279 --> 03:37:09,920
investigations so uh

4719
03:37:09,920 --> 03:37:12,560
let's say it's the process of making

4720
03:37:12,560 --> 03:37:16,000
a better copy or a copy just simple copy

4721
03:37:16,000 --> 03:37:18,960
for the entire hard drive

4722
03:37:18,960 --> 03:37:22,640
so we can work with it

4723
03:37:23,520 --> 03:37:26,319
so to do just we have here

4724
03:37:26,319 --> 03:37:28,479
to choose the type of the physical drive

4725
03:37:28,479 --> 03:37:31,120
that we have to copy so for example if

4726
03:37:31,120 --> 03:37:33,760
we install directly imager on the

4727
03:37:33,760 --> 03:37:35,120
contracted machine so we should be

4728
03:37:35,120 --> 03:37:37,520
typical drive in our case i attached an

4729
03:37:37,520 --> 03:37:40,720
external disk to the command machine so

4730
03:37:40,720 --> 03:37:43,120
it will be a logical drive also we can

4731
03:37:43,120 --> 03:37:45,600
analyze an image case from vdd for

4732
03:37:45,600 --> 03:37:49,439
example or just the content

4733
03:37:49,680 --> 03:37:50,880
so

4734
03:37:50,880 --> 03:37:53,120
we give him here

4735
03:37:53,120 --> 03:37:54,560
what

4736
03:37:54,560 --> 03:37:56,640
solution

4737
03:37:56,640 --> 03:37:59,439
finish and it will start

4738
03:37:59,439 --> 03:38:03,120
analyzing the content of this uh disk or

4739
03:38:03,120 --> 03:38:06,800
image after that we can go directly file

4740
03:38:06,800 --> 03:38:10,080
and create this image so now when we

4741
03:38:10,080 --> 03:38:13,479
delete this

4742
03:38:17,680 --> 03:38:19,200
and here

4743
03:38:19,200 --> 03:38:22,399
we have to add the image destination

4744
03:38:22,399 --> 03:38:24,720
so we have to show its row for example

4745
03:38:24,720 --> 03:38:26,960
the dd or the smart or the engaged

4746
03:38:26,960 --> 03:38:28,880
expansion of the apa

4747
03:38:28,880 --> 03:38:31,040
so here we have to choose the the

4748
03:38:31,040 --> 03:38:33,920
extension i recommend always to use the

4749
03:38:33,920 --> 03:38:36,479
first one the raw otg

4750
03:38:36,479 --> 03:38:37,520
image

4751
03:38:37,520 --> 03:38:40,640
so we can even

4752
03:38:48,560 --> 03:38:51,560
so

4753
03:38:55,359 --> 03:38:57,279
and here's the image destination folder

4754
03:38:57,279 --> 03:39:00,080
so we're given just a path to follow the

4755
03:39:00,080 --> 03:39:01,199
image

4756
03:39:01,199 --> 03:39:04,479
the file name for example

4757
03:39:05,040 --> 03:39:08,040
first

4758
03:39:08,479 --> 03:39:11,439
and we click on change so now i will not

4759
03:39:11,439 --> 03:39:14,000
click on start because my dm i have a

4760
03:39:14,000 --> 03:39:17,120
lot uh i don't have a lot of storage but

4761
03:39:17,120 --> 03:39:20,239
when i start when it starts you starting

4762
03:39:20,239 --> 03:39:22,399
making an image of the

4763
03:39:22,399 --> 03:39:25,600
apache disk and this image will be a

4764
03:39:25,600 --> 03:39:29,199
real clone of what i have on this event

4765
03:39:29,199 --> 03:39:32,080
if i try to restart the deleted data

4766
03:39:32,080 --> 03:39:34,800
from this image it would be the same as

4767
03:39:34,800 --> 03:39:37,199
this so now i can present the rear disk

4768
03:39:37,199 --> 03:39:41,600
for the curve and work on this flow

4769
03:39:45,680 --> 03:39:47,680
also

4770
03:39:47,680 --> 03:39:51,199
we can use the photoshop here

4771
03:39:51,199 --> 03:39:54,080
i will show you because

4772
03:39:57,920 --> 03:40:00,640
and autopsy can help us to collect the

4773
03:40:00,640 --> 03:40:02,479
evidence directly from this

4774
03:40:02,479 --> 03:40:06,000
so uh as you can see unless it's on the

4775
03:40:06,000 --> 03:40:07,600
my joint list

4776
03:40:07,600 --> 03:40:09,760
so uh you can see here he classifies

4777
03:40:09,760 --> 03:40:12,080
automatically the file by extension by

4778
03:40:12,080 --> 03:40:15,279
my side he can also uh

4779
03:40:15,279 --> 03:40:17,520
recover the deleted file

4780
03:40:17,520 --> 03:40:19,920
he can give me an idea about the file

4781
03:40:19,920 --> 03:40:22,160
size so for example if i found the file

4782
03:40:22,160 --> 03:40:25,120
with big really good

4783
03:40:25,120 --> 03:40:26,399
size

4784
03:40:26,399 --> 03:40:27,279
it

4785
03:40:27,279 --> 03:40:29,870
has to be database or

4786
03:40:29,870 --> 03:40:31,439
[Music]

4787
03:40:31,439 --> 03:40:33,920
related to an attack to

4788
03:40:33,920 --> 03:40:36,560
push out the disturbance of our disk so

4789
03:40:36,560 --> 03:40:39,520
also we can found um section data

4790
03:40:39,520 --> 03:40:42,160
artifacts that contain a lot of useful

4791
03:40:42,160 --> 03:40:43,920
affirmations for example all the

4792
03:40:43,920 --> 03:40:46,720
communication accounts the email message

4793
03:40:46,720 --> 03:40:48,239
sellers program

4794
03:40:48,239 --> 03:40:50,640
the interesting of course the selection

4795
03:40:50,640 --> 03:40:52,960
here for entertainment

4796
03:40:52,960 --> 03:40:55,359
data operation system information recent

4797
03:40:55,359 --> 03:40:57,840
document the last one open it

4798
03:40:57,840 --> 03:41:01,040
remote device user

4799
03:41:07,600 --> 03:41:09,439
so as you can see here for the last

4800
03:41:09,439 --> 03:41:11,040
fight he stole

4801
03:41:11,040 --> 03:41:14,080
uh 2000

4802
03:41:14,080 --> 03:41:16,239
hundred sixty two five system

4803
03:41:16,239 --> 03:41:17,040
uh

4804
03:41:17,040 --> 03:41:19,120
so i really clicked because he would

4805
03:41:19,120 --> 03:41:21,120
take a lot of time to

4806
03:41:21,120 --> 03:41:22,960
see me

4807
03:41:22,960 --> 03:41:26,479
show so and for the analysis

4808
03:41:26,479 --> 03:41:28,479
also he the encryption suspected for

4809
03:41:28,479 --> 03:41:31,199
example for profile existing data

4810
03:41:31,199 --> 03:41:33,840
extension is much detected so some

4811
03:41:33,840 --> 03:41:36,399
malware use this technique to

4812
03:41:36,399 --> 03:41:37,920
hide the

4813
03:41:37,920 --> 03:41:39,279
nature of

4814
03:41:39,279 --> 03:41:42,880
the web account also

4815
03:41:42,880 --> 03:41:45,120
of course that those options are

4816
03:41:45,120 --> 03:41:48,319
selected when i cleared this case so now

4817
03:41:48,319 --> 03:41:52,319
i have to stop it from working

4818
03:41:55,120 --> 03:41:58,080
just have a little three of resources

4819
03:41:58,080 --> 03:42:00,640
that i can show you how

4820
03:42:00,640 --> 03:42:01,359
so

4821
03:42:01,359 --> 03:42:04,399
in fact when we start

4822
03:42:08,399 --> 03:42:10,880
when we start the case the first thing

4823
03:42:10,880 --> 03:42:13,359
that we showed you this one so we have

4824
03:42:13,359 --> 03:42:16,479
to give indicate information

4825
03:42:16,479 --> 03:42:18,000
that is directly

4826
03:42:18,000 --> 03:42:20,000
where you will

4827
03:42:20,000 --> 03:42:22,960
store the collected evidence

4828
03:42:22,960 --> 03:42:25,439
and then you click on next

4829
03:42:25,439 --> 03:42:27,760
so here we give a number

4830
03:42:27,760 --> 03:42:29,920
and information about

4831
03:42:29,920 --> 03:42:31,199
x and minus

4832
03:42:31,199 --> 03:42:34,319
and then we click on finish

4833
03:42:35,279 --> 03:42:36,840
once you're

4834
03:42:36,840 --> 03:42:40,960
done you create

4835
03:42:41,279 --> 03:42:43,600
the page to store on the database to

4836
03:42:43,600 --> 03:42:46,399
solve evidence

4837
03:42:50,800 --> 03:42:53,920
and we will be able to choose the ingest

4838
03:42:53,920 --> 03:42:57,120
module or the option let's say the

4839
03:42:57,120 --> 03:43:01,840
plugin used by photoshop to analyze

4840
03:43:05,120 --> 03:43:07,439
as you can see here so i will not

4841
03:43:07,439 --> 03:43:10,080
take a lot of fans over here

4842
03:43:10,080 --> 03:43:13,120
if you look at this

4843
03:43:13,920 --> 03:43:16,319
okay

4844
03:43:18,560 --> 03:43:21,279
okay

4845
03:43:21,279 --> 03:43:22,720
next

4846
03:43:22,720 --> 03:43:24,960
okay here we will choose the ingest

4847
03:43:24,960 --> 03:43:28,000
model that we will use to bring

4848
03:43:28,000 --> 03:43:30,640
the evidence back so as you can see we

4849
03:43:30,640 --> 03:43:31,680
can

4850
03:43:31,680 --> 03:43:34,720
search for recent activity hash look

4851
03:43:34,720 --> 03:43:36,960
look up file type identification

4852
03:43:36,960 --> 03:43:39,600
continuous device detector embedded file

4853
03:43:39,600 --> 03:43:42,399
extractor etc so there is a lot of

4854
03:43:42,399 --> 03:43:44,560
ingestion that you have to choose

4855
03:43:44,560 --> 03:43:46,640
and then start

4856
03:43:46,640 --> 03:43:48,560
the data collection or the

4857
03:43:48,560 --> 03:43:50,479
collection

4858
03:43:50,479 --> 03:43:53,120
also there is another tool that

4859
03:43:53,120 --> 03:43:56,000
i'll show you

4860
03:43:59,520 --> 03:44:00,840
this one

4861
03:44:00,840 --> 03:44:04,000
before of course i will share with you

4862
03:44:04,000 --> 03:44:06,640
this machine

4863
03:44:07,120 --> 03:44:09,760
is the gt

4864
03:44:09,760 --> 03:44:11,040
one of the

4865
03:44:11,040 --> 03:44:12,560
best tools

4866
03:44:12,560 --> 03:44:15,359
personally i prefer these tools and i

4867
03:44:15,359 --> 03:44:18,239
use it mostly

4868
03:44:25,439 --> 03:44:27,680
so these tools will directly check the

4869
03:44:27,680 --> 03:44:30,720
system and believe to me the

4870
03:44:30,720 --> 03:44:33,680
persistent evidence i don't need to see

4871
03:44:33,680 --> 03:44:36,399
small i can use direct previous tools

4872
03:44:36,399 --> 03:44:39,600
and they will bring me directly

4873
03:44:39,600 --> 03:44:41,120
the persistence

4874
03:44:41,120 --> 03:44:43,760
so we can use target option here

4875
03:44:43,760 --> 03:44:47,040
given the target source

4876
03:44:49,520 --> 03:44:52,319
the destination

4877
03:44:55,760 --> 03:44:58,800
and then i will choose what i need

4878
03:44:58,800 --> 03:45:02,399
as evidence so for example

4879
03:45:02,399 --> 03:45:05,680
all files with log5 msd

4880
03:45:05,680 --> 03:45:06,880
let's say

4881
03:45:06,880 --> 03:45:09,680
word space

4882
03:45:09,680 --> 03:45:12,720
on device log in logs

4883
03:45:12,960 --> 03:45:14,319
so what

4884
03:45:14,319 --> 03:45:15,600
kind of

4885
03:45:15,600 --> 03:45:18,399
let's say information i need i can also

4886
03:45:18,399 --> 03:45:21,279
use the module option here to

4887
03:45:21,279 --> 03:45:23,199
choose also

4888
03:45:23,199 --> 03:45:24,560
for example

4889
03:45:24,560 --> 03:45:27,120
i have to find the basics on the

4890
03:45:27,120 --> 03:45:31,760
keywords here for example for emails url

4891
03:45:31,760 --> 03:45:36,960
or adp collection so a lot of others

4892
03:45:36,960 --> 03:45:39,279
sorry for that people have time to

4893
03:45:39,279 --> 03:45:41,600
explain all

4894
03:45:41,600 --> 03:45:44,399
after the selection is done we can

4895
03:45:44,399 --> 03:45:47,120
just execute

4896
03:45:47,120 --> 03:45:52,359
okay and you willing as something like

4897
03:45:54,560 --> 03:45:58,080
so a lot of information here

4898
03:45:58,080 --> 03:46:01,840
for example uh one of the law of answers

4899
03:46:01,840 --> 03:46:04,399
this one is

4900
03:46:05,760 --> 03:46:08,880
a lot of tools

4901
03:46:08,880 --> 03:46:11,520
of information so what we do with this

4902
03:46:11,520 --> 03:46:12,479
one

4903
03:46:12,479 --> 03:46:13,680
because

4904
03:46:13,680 --> 03:46:15,680
like i said before it's a lot of

4905
03:46:15,680 --> 03:46:17,120
gigabytes

4906
03:46:17,120 --> 03:46:20,640
of evidence connected so

4907
03:46:20,640 --> 03:46:22,479
we have to use some

4908
03:46:22,479 --> 03:46:24,560
other tools that would help us to

4909
03:46:24,560 --> 03:46:27,439
organize all of this data because doing

4910
03:46:27,439 --> 03:46:30,399
this manually we take a lot of time

4911
03:46:30,399 --> 03:46:33,040
very very long time so i will close this

4912
03:46:33,040 --> 03:46:34,800
machine

4913
03:46:34,800 --> 03:46:36,960
and i will use this one

4914
03:46:36,960 --> 03:46:38,880
also this machine with it would be

4915
03:46:38,880 --> 03:46:42,560
shared uh on the same

4916
03:46:44,160 --> 03:46:46,800
and this is the last one we will see

4917
03:46:46,800 --> 03:46:48,239
i will try to

4918
03:46:48,239 --> 03:46:51,199
add on the video

4919
03:46:51,199 --> 03:46:52,239
so

4920
03:46:52,239 --> 03:46:54,880
some other tutorials to help you

4921
03:46:54,880 --> 03:46:58,198
doing investigation

4922
03:47:28,940 --> 03:47:31,520
[Music]

4923
03:47:31,520 --> 03:47:34,000
login

4924
03:47:36,880 --> 03:47:40,358
and reset

4925
03:48:09,199 --> 03:48:12,199
okay

4926
03:48:18,080 --> 03:48:20,880
so twitter let's say it's a

4927
03:48:20,880 --> 03:48:22,880
digital investigation platform that

4928
03:48:22,880 --> 03:48:24,399
provides accessibility for the

4929
03:48:24,399 --> 03:48:26,319
investigator

4930
03:48:26,319 --> 03:48:29,039
and the federation

4931
03:48:32,160 --> 03:48:34,640
in addition collaborate with other team

4932
03:48:34,640 --> 03:48:36,880
members on the same platform by tagging

4933
03:48:36,880 --> 03:48:39,199
the artifacts and present it as a

4934
03:48:39,199 --> 03:48:41,920
timeline as well as the setting rule for

4935
03:48:41,920 --> 03:48:44,399
automating the detection

4936
03:48:44,399 --> 03:48:47,120
of precision evidence the main purpose

4937
03:48:47,120 --> 03:48:50,080
of this project is

4938
03:48:50,080 --> 03:48:52,239
streamlining digital investigation

4939
03:48:52,239 --> 03:48:53,840
and although advanced analytic

4940
03:48:53,840 --> 03:48:56,720
capability with the ability to handle a

4941
03:48:56,720 --> 03:48:59,040
large amount of data

4942
03:48:59,040 --> 03:49:01,920
as we said it's always a large amount of

4943
03:49:01,920 --> 03:49:05,199
analyze if we do everything correctly so

4944
03:49:05,199 --> 03:49:08,319
we can go here

4945
03:49:19,359 --> 03:49:20,880
okay so

4946
03:49:20,880 --> 03:49:22,840
the first one first

4947
03:49:22,840 --> 03:49:25,359
um is the administrator

4948
03:49:25,359 --> 03:49:27,680
panel so we have to create case

4949
03:49:27,680 --> 03:49:30,399
we give it a name

4950
03:49:30,399 --> 03:49:32,319
and if the status is active or not

4951
03:49:32,319 --> 03:49:34,479
active of course when we say access

4952
03:49:34,479 --> 03:49:36,640
after we resolve everything it will be

4953
03:49:36,640 --> 03:49:39,198
done

4954
03:49:47,199 --> 03:49:49,199
after we save the case we can go in the

4955
03:49:49,199 --> 03:49:53,439
case and we add first of all

4956
03:49:53,439 --> 03:49:54,960
the machine so

4957
03:49:54,960 --> 03:49:58,399
we have to create a machine for example

4958
03:49:58,399 --> 03:50:01,039
h1

4959
03:50:05,600 --> 03:50:08,479
and after that we can upload directly

4960
03:50:08,479 --> 03:50:11,120
that are collected from this machine

4961
03:50:11,120 --> 03:50:13,520
this password to be analyzed

4962
03:50:13,520 --> 03:50:15,760
uh in the same case in the same case of

4963
03:50:15,760 --> 03:50:17,520
course we can have a lot of other

4964
03:50:17,520 --> 03:50:20,319
machines so

4965
03:50:27,439 --> 03:50:30,399
even manually directly and twitter will

4966
03:50:30,399 --> 03:50:34,160
analyze those artifacts and we give us a

4967
03:50:34,160 --> 03:50:36,800
good view of uh

4968
03:50:36,800 --> 03:50:37,760
those

4969
03:50:37,760 --> 03:50:40,560
relations between different log events

4970
03:50:40,560 --> 03:50:43,920
and different uh metadata for example

4971
03:50:43,920 --> 03:50:47,120
so i will show you just to understand it

4972
03:50:47,120 --> 03:50:49,359
so after uploading to that we have to

4973
03:50:49,359 --> 03:50:50,239
start

4974
03:50:50,239 --> 03:50:51,120
uh

4975
03:50:51,120 --> 03:50:52,239
choosing

4976
03:50:52,239 --> 03:50:55,520
what process or how to handle uh this

4977
03:50:55,520 --> 03:50:57,520
house with this data so for example we

4978
03:50:57,520 --> 03:50:59,760
can activate the msd to analyze scatter

4979
03:50:59,760 --> 03:51:02,720
tasks or a lot of

4980
03:51:06,880 --> 03:51:09,920
what happened related to the os

4981
03:51:09,920 --> 03:51:11,680
loading information to program

4982
03:51:11,680 --> 03:51:13,359
institution to a browser to other

4983
03:51:13,359 --> 03:51:16,319
certification to user activity also so

4984
03:51:16,319 --> 03:51:17,680
we will try to

4985
03:51:17,680 --> 03:51:20,720
analyze the behavior of the user or of

4986
03:51:20,720 --> 03:51:22,319
course

4987
03:51:22,319 --> 03:51:25,680
so here i prepared machines directly to

4988
03:51:25,680 --> 03:51:26,560
show you

4989
03:51:26,560 --> 03:51:29,439
because it takes a little bit of time to

4990
03:51:29,439 --> 03:51:30,880
analyze

4991
03:51:30,880 --> 03:51:33,600
the data uploaded so you can go directly

4992
03:51:33,600 --> 03:51:35,600
on

4993
03:51:35,600 --> 03:51:37,760
this

4994
03:51:37,760 --> 03:51:40,000
one

4995
03:51:40,960 --> 03:51:44,198
this one

4996
03:51:44,560 --> 03:51:47,120
so we can directly go and really see how

4997
03:51:47,120 --> 03:51:49,760
for example how uh

4998
03:51:49,760 --> 03:51:53,520
the windows event uploaded

4999
03:51:54,640 --> 03:51:56,080
and

5000
03:51:56,080 --> 03:51:58,399
the different evidence that i sent here

5001
03:51:58,399 --> 03:52:00,479
for example now when we start license

5002
03:52:00,479 --> 03:52:03,199
it's always complicated too but even if

5003
03:52:03,199 --> 03:52:04,720
it's

5004
03:52:04,720 --> 03:52:06,960
organized and shows

5005
03:52:06,960 --> 03:52:09,439
like that so what we see for example you

5006
03:52:09,439 --> 03:52:12,319
can say that this one security event is

5007
03:52:12,319 --> 03:52:15,199
interesting so i can see here again some

5008
03:52:15,199 --> 03:52:17,439
information on the details here

5009
03:52:17,439 --> 03:52:19,439
so about this

5010
03:52:19,439 --> 03:52:20,720
event

5011
03:52:20,720 --> 03:52:22,880
this is the information and now

5012
03:52:22,880 --> 03:52:25,520
for example i will

5013
03:52:25,520 --> 03:52:28,080
search for other events

5014
03:52:28,080 --> 03:52:31,600
happening in the same that time

5015
03:52:31,600 --> 03:52:34,880
okay so i click on the time yes and you

5016
03:52:34,880 --> 03:52:38,239
will analyze his face and regret to me

5017
03:52:38,239 --> 03:52:41,600
all the events that is related

5018
03:52:41,600 --> 03:52:44,000
to this one and happen

5019
03:52:44,000 --> 03:52:45,520
in the same time

5020
03:52:45,520 --> 03:52:48,720
so now again uh investigation you give

5021
03:52:48,720 --> 03:52:50,479
me a

5022
03:52:50,479 --> 03:52:53,040
good way or the easy way to understand

5023
03:52:53,040 --> 03:52:56,319
how the relation uh happened between

5024
03:52:56,319 --> 03:53:00,239
those even for example after that

5025
03:53:01,680 --> 03:53:03,680
let's see that this event is related to

5026
03:53:03,680 --> 03:53:06,640
an access using sap but

5027
03:53:06,640 --> 03:53:08,960
they decide to access uh

5028
03:53:08,960 --> 03:53:11,600
an administrative let's say uh sharing

5029
03:53:11,600 --> 03:53:13,359
which is etc

5030
03:53:13,359 --> 03:53:16,239
so this is another part so i will try to

5031
03:53:16,239 --> 03:53:19,120
find all the access for this

5032
03:53:19,120 --> 03:53:20,239
uh

5033
03:53:20,239 --> 03:53:23,520
for the share and give me from here

5034
03:53:23,520 --> 03:53:27,359
the view of for every axis made it to

5035
03:53:27,359 --> 03:53:29,760
epc

5036
03:53:31,920 --> 03:53:34,720
so every point when i speak i get a lot

5037
03:53:34,720 --> 03:53:37,600
of information and for every incident

5038
03:53:37,600 --> 03:53:40,640
here or every event here i can make a

5039
03:53:40,640 --> 03:53:43,199
lot of other

5040
03:53:43,199 --> 03:53:45,520
let's say relation for example which is

5041
03:53:45,520 --> 03:53:47,520
also we can see that

5042
03:53:47,520 --> 03:53:50,720
this event is an access to epc solar

5043
03:53:50,720 --> 03:53:53,840
using this others so we found i would i

5044
03:53:53,840 --> 03:53:56,319
like to know

5045
03:53:56,319 --> 03:53:58,319
the whole of the old event related to

5046
03:53:58,319 --> 03:54:00,640
this other so i have just put it here

5047
03:54:00,640 --> 03:54:03,680
and it will be directly

5048
03:54:03,680 --> 03:54:07,359
you will make directly a connection

5049
03:54:07,840 --> 03:54:08,800
to

5050
03:54:08,800 --> 03:54:11,840
all those events

5051
03:54:12,000 --> 03:54:14,560
related to this ip others so i can after

5052
03:54:14,560 --> 03:54:16,319
that click on that and understand a

5053
03:54:16,319 --> 03:54:18,960
little bit for

5054
03:54:21,840 --> 03:54:25,920
as you can see so i can also ask him to

5055
03:54:25,920 --> 03:54:28,000
give me to bring them to me

5056
03:54:28,000 --> 03:54:28,800
which

5057
03:54:28,800 --> 03:54:32,960
the login used by admits and then

5058
03:54:45,760 --> 03:54:47,920
in the real case of attack there will

5059
03:54:47,920 --> 03:54:49,760
not be a lot

5060
03:54:49,760 --> 03:54:51,520
of events like that because that's just

5061
03:54:51,520 --> 03:54:54,319
stimulation of many attacks so and made

5062
03:54:54,319 --> 03:54:57,120
it all from the one and only

5063
03:54:57,120 --> 03:54:59,439
which is mine but i stimulate those

5064
03:54:59,439 --> 03:55:01,600
attacks so there is a lot of

5065
03:55:01,600 --> 03:55:04,640
event related to my ip address but when

5066
03:55:04,640 --> 03:55:06,080
it's attacked

5067
03:55:06,080 --> 03:55:09,600
it should be always uh distributed so

5068
03:55:09,600 --> 03:55:13,680
from each machine i will i will get

5069
03:55:13,680 --> 03:55:15,920
some specific affirmations that they

5070
03:55:15,920 --> 03:55:17,920
will help me to understand what happened

5071
03:55:17,920 --> 03:55:20,160
and with difficulties in this

5072
03:55:20,160 --> 03:55:23,120
orientation more easy to lean

5073
03:55:23,120 --> 03:55:25,680
between different even events on

5074
03:55:25,680 --> 03:55:27,199
different machines

5075
03:55:27,199 --> 03:55:28,640
so

5076
03:55:28,640 --> 03:55:31,439
not to take a lot of your time but after

5077
03:55:31,439 --> 03:55:33,840
finalizing and understanding uh what

5078
03:55:33,840 --> 03:55:37,359
happened exactly so we had the duty as a

5079
03:55:37,359 --> 03:55:40,000
ccr to share the information

5080
03:55:40,000 --> 03:55:42,479
so we not not

5081
03:55:42,479 --> 03:55:44,160
have the

5082
03:55:44,160 --> 03:55:45,600
the lesson learned

5083
03:55:45,600 --> 03:55:48,479
for us so we have to share it for that

5084
03:55:48,479 --> 03:55:50,880
we can use

5085
03:55:50,880 --> 03:55:52,399
nice

5086
03:55:52,399 --> 03:55:55,399
application

5087
03:56:07,920 --> 03:56:10,160
platform for gathering sharing starting

5088
03:56:10,160 --> 03:56:13,040
and correlating indicator of compromise

5089
03:56:13,040 --> 03:56:15,199
of directed attacks so trade

5090
03:56:15,199 --> 03:56:17,840
intelligence financial fraud information

5091
03:56:17,840 --> 03:56:19,760
information whatever forever

5092
03:56:19,760 --> 03:56:21,520
terrorism information is no problem

5093
03:56:21,520 --> 03:56:25,279
integrating records future security

5094
03:56:35,040 --> 03:56:37,199
to respond quickly with

5095
03:56:37,199 --> 03:56:38,479
transparency

5096
03:56:38,479 --> 03:56:39,840
and the

5097
03:56:39,840 --> 03:56:42,720
input x maxima is the investment in

5098
03:56:42,720 --> 03:56:45,199
existing security tools of course we

5099
03:56:45,199 --> 03:56:47,040
understand

5100
03:56:47,040 --> 03:56:49,439
what is doing and improve security team

5101
03:56:49,439 --> 03:56:50,640
efficiency

5102
03:56:50,640 --> 03:56:53,920
reduce many resistance times so we we

5103
03:56:53,920 --> 03:56:55,040
can get

5104
03:56:55,040 --> 03:56:58,239
information also from the mix directly

5105
03:56:58,239 --> 03:57:00,800
to see if our incident is

5106
03:57:00,800 --> 03:57:03,920
already documented or not so if it's

5107
03:57:03,920 --> 03:57:07,520
documented we helped us a lot to

5108
03:57:07,520 --> 03:57:09,760
understand what happened

5109
03:57:09,760 --> 03:57:11,680
just i will share with you

5110
03:57:11,680 --> 03:57:15,920
another link this thing is

5111
03:57:15,920 --> 03:57:18,880
in fact it's not really updated now i

5112
03:57:18,880 --> 03:57:20,880
have when it's just one

5113
03:57:20,880 --> 03:57:23,600
with the machine but there is a other

5114
03:57:23,600 --> 03:57:26,560
machine that will be

5115
03:57:27,199 --> 03:57:28,800
added to

5116
03:57:28,800 --> 03:57:31,680
this folder so i will try to upload all

5117
03:57:31,680 --> 03:57:34,239
the virtual machines that i talked about

5118
03:57:34,239 --> 03:57:37,120
so directly uh on this link i will send

5119
03:57:37,120 --> 03:57:40,160
also the link to mr levito to share

5120
03:57:40,160 --> 03:57:41,600
with all of you

5121
03:57:41,600 --> 03:57:44,800
using make so

5122
03:57:45,359 --> 03:57:49,840
we continue of course after

5123
03:58:01,680 --> 03:58:02,960
some

5124
03:58:02,960 --> 03:58:06,239
tools or malicious tools use it to

5125
03:58:06,239 --> 03:58:09,760
to take access so we have to turn into a

5126
03:58:09,760 --> 03:58:11,760
malware analysis after that but we don't

5127
03:58:11,760 --> 03:58:14,399
have time for that

5128
03:58:14,399 --> 03:58:17,279
don't go through the marijuana analysis

5129
03:58:17,279 --> 03:58:20,000
so deeply but just to understand the

5130
03:58:20,000 --> 03:58:21,760
behavior and watch the indication of

5131
03:58:21,760 --> 03:58:23,920
compromise to share it with other

5132
03:58:23,920 --> 03:58:27,439
cities and of course

5133
03:58:27,680 --> 03:58:31,279
it talks about that so we have to uh

5134
03:58:31,279 --> 03:58:32,720
work small

5135
03:58:32,720 --> 03:58:34,399
and then payment

5136
03:58:34,399 --> 03:58:37,439
so we have to start

5137
03:58:38,080 --> 03:58:39,920
let's say um

5138
03:58:39,920 --> 03:58:41,920
we don't go directly for

5139
03:58:41,920 --> 03:58:44,080
the commercial tools and the big ones

5140
03:58:44,080 --> 03:58:46,160
without having

5141
03:58:46,160 --> 03:58:48,319
necessary skills

5142
03:58:48,319 --> 03:58:49,920
to mastering

5143
03:58:49,920 --> 03:58:52,160
those approach or the accident because

5144
03:58:52,160 --> 03:58:55,359
in fact when we do that

5145
03:58:55,600 --> 03:58:57,359
we have to deal with

5146
03:58:57,359 --> 03:59:00,479
network issues system huge issues

5147
03:59:00,479 --> 03:59:02,800
issues

5148
03:59:03,920 --> 03:59:06,720
absolutely everything so

5149
03:59:06,720 --> 03:59:08,720
skill compares so

5150
03:59:08,720 --> 03:59:11,600
try to make a lot of training

5151
03:59:11,600 --> 03:59:14,479
tries to have a lot of experience try to

5152
03:59:14,479 --> 03:59:16,160
investigate even

5153
03:59:16,160 --> 03:59:18,800
the capability ask the answer ask the

5154
03:59:18,800 --> 03:59:21,840
secretary and ask mr bill also is our

5155
03:59:21,840 --> 03:59:22,880
matter

5156
03:59:22,880 --> 03:59:24,720
of fact so

5157
03:59:24,720 --> 03:59:27,760
just to help you with that and

5158
03:59:27,760 --> 03:59:30,239
then you we have

5159
03:59:30,239 --> 03:59:32,640
the skills don't come along so we will

5160
03:59:32,640 --> 03:59:36,239
we have to work hard to uh

5161
03:59:36,239 --> 03:59:38,720
let's say have our uh

5162
03:59:38,720 --> 03:59:41,040
so of course

5163
03:59:41,040 --> 03:59:41,920
another

5164
03:59:41,920 --> 03:59:44,880
thing we have to

5165
03:59:45,520 --> 03:59:48,319
talk about is that we have to

5166
03:59:48,319 --> 03:59:50,120
prepare

5167
03:59:50,120 --> 03:59:52,319
a physical

5168
03:59:52,319 --> 03:59:54,239
disconnect network for the team to work

5169
03:59:54,239 --> 03:59:56,479
on it of course they will not analyze

5170
03:59:56,479 --> 03:59:58,399
starting analyzing malware or

5171
03:59:58,399 --> 04:00:00,560
unpractical machine on infected machine

5172
04:00:00,560 --> 04:00:03,120
uh in the same information system as

5173
04:00:03,120 --> 04:00:05,439
this is it so prepare your labs repair

5174
04:00:05,439 --> 04:00:09,040
your tools without your

5175
04:00:16,319 --> 04:00:19,120
and this is not really something

5176
04:00:19,120 --> 04:00:22,080
easy because we have to prepare also a

5177
04:00:22,080 --> 04:00:24,640
whole information system or a simulation

5178
04:00:24,640 --> 04:00:26,319
of the whole operation for example

5179
04:00:26,319 --> 04:00:27,600
sometimes

5180
04:00:27,600 --> 04:00:29,439
we use the type dns we need to unpack

5181
04:00:29,439 --> 04:00:32,000
esc we need to take a shitty server so

5182
04:00:32,000 --> 04:00:34,080
we need a lot of paid

5183
04:00:34,080 --> 04:00:36,319
services to simulate real environment

5184
04:00:36,319 --> 04:00:37,359
for

5185
04:00:37,359 --> 04:00:39,680
the malware so here again we have to

5186
04:00:39,680 --> 04:00:42,720
prepare our lab to prepare

5187
04:00:42,720 --> 04:00:43,600
our

5188
04:00:43,600 --> 04:00:47,520
infrastructure to be ready to

5189
04:00:47,520 --> 04:00:48,640
analyze

5190
04:00:48,640 --> 04:00:51,439
and investigate

5191
04:01:02,239 --> 04:01:05,359
so we had to

5192
04:01:05,359 --> 04:01:08,319
have your shield back to

5193
04:01:08,319 --> 04:01:10,080
be sure that your phone will not

5194
04:01:10,080 --> 04:01:13,600
communicate when you are analyzing

5195
04:01:13,600 --> 04:01:16,479
it and also the different cable and the

5196
04:01:16,479 --> 04:01:18,000
different techniques access to this

5197
04:01:18,000 --> 04:01:20,160
mobile phone or

5198
04:01:20,160 --> 04:01:23,040
and to analyze it you have to know that

5199
04:01:23,040 --> 04:01:25,199
something is uh

5200
04:01:25,199 --> 04:01:28,560
uas sometimes androids

5201
04:01:28,560 --> 04:01:31,600
there is a lot of model and a lot of

5202
04:01:31,600 --> 04:01:34,239
for mobile devices that we need to

5203
04:01:34,239 --> 04:01:35,920
support also

5204
04:01:35,920 --> 04:01:37,120
in our

5205
04:01:37,120 --> 04:01:38,000
lab

5206
04:01:38,000 --> 04:01:39,600
so after that

5207
04:01:39,600 --> 04:01:41,920
mr marilla give it away thank you again

5208
04:01:41,920 --> 04:01:43,600
thank you for the successful team thank

5209
04:01:43,600 --> 04:01:46,080
you for you the audience and i give the

5210
04:01:46,080 --> 04:01:48,640
world to me

04:01:49,279 --> 04:01:51,680
thank you thank you i mean

5212
