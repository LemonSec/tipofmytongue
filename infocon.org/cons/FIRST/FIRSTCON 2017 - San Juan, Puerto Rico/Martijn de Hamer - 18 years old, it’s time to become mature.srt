1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,389
alright and with that I will run away it

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:05,609
is absolutely my pleasure to introduce

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:06,600
our speaker

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,059
Martina hammer and I'm sure that's about

5
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:10,740
as brutal as an American can screw up

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,469
that name he is the head of the National

7
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:16,859
Cyber Security Operations Center at ncsc

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,100
and L many of us old-timers remember

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,699
that as gov cert NL and after having

10
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:24,869
various roles in the field of

11
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:26,609
information security he started working

12
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,910
there in 2005 he's also been very active

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,520
in the field of c-cert maturity and

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,860
working there so I am very excited to

15
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,910
hear what he has to say

16
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:43,800
Martine right thank you very much

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,910
everybody

18
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,039
so sticks 2.0 is technology so I'm not

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,390
going to talk about that or mention it

20
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,940
in any way today I'm actually going to

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:58,469
talk about c-cert maturity I'm a runner

22
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,710
and I'm in a team that runs from Paris

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,099
to Rotterdam every year unfortunately I

24
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,990
was unable to do so this year because of

25
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,170
health issues but last year I did and

26
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,430
last year was the first time my team

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,799
team ran from Paris Rotterdam for those

28
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,090
of you that don't know the distance it's

29
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,420
about 520 K running from paris to

30
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,210
rotterdam which is quite a feat we do

31
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,280
this with eight people in two teams and

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,070
the complete team is 25 people it takes

33
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,810
about 48 hours and it's a non-stop relay

34
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,490
what while preparing for this talk I was

35
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,680
also preparing simultaneously for this

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,270
run and it struck me that there are

37
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,790
quite a number of similarities between

38
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,400
preparing for a run and preparing for a

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,970
C set and making sure that your C set

40
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,360
becomes mature so basically the first

41
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,950
one is that you need to learn from

42
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,149
others you need to stand on the

43
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:53,520
shoulders of giants so we learned very

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,219
quickly how not to do stuff by copying

45
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:00,119
for example scripts from other teams the

46
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,590
next thing is that you need to keep on

47
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,590
measuring your speed so measure to see

48
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,750
how you're standing - in relation to

49
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,090
your goal which is quite important

50
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,348
otherwise you're not going to make the

51
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:12,270
cutoff of 11 K per hour so we aim for

52
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,020
eleven point three K per hour

53
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,600
this year and the heroes that Randa that

54
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,830
the course actually ran 11.6 K per hour

55
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,300
the reason why we're doing this is for a

56
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,240
good cause we're actually collecting

57
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,850
money for for people that have cancer

58
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,100
and for the not the cure for cancer but

59
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,490
for the care for cancer patients that's

60
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,290
why we're you know doing this and we're

61
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,390
very invested in this topic the last

62
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,050
parallel basically is that you need to

63
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,230
[Music]

64
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,910
practice practice practice

65
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,500
without doing the practice you have no

66
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,060
idea what you're doing along the way and

67
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,710
this is also something we see in setting

68
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,070
up C cert and running a six-shot I can

69
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,720
tell you when you're driving down from

70
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,160
The Hague going to Paris and you're in a

71
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,380
car that goes at 120 K per hour and

72
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,700
you're in that car for about for an hour

73
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,490
five hours you really get a feel for the

74
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,830
distance and it definitely helps keeping

75
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,500
your sanity knowing that you've got a

76
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,120
process you've practiced you know you're

77
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,130
going to be able to do this because

78
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,500
otherwise you know it's like eating an

79
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,730
elephant you need to take one step at

80
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,710
the time the same goes for setting up a

81
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,270
C set and becoming more mature as a

82
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,200
sixer now let's start with the main

83
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,810
message first of all we're all

84
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,200
interlinked which means that we help

85
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,260
ourselves by helping others so if one

86
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,709
team we hear as established teams we all

87
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:38,770
need each other so when I know what you

88
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,140
do with my information and if when I

89
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,820
know what your information is coming

90
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,190
from and what you've been doing to get

91
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,440
that information we can help each other

92
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,230
in a better way by helping other teams

93
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,360
set up we can kick-start them in the

94
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,470
process where they become become more

95
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,910
mature and their information becomes

96
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,630
more valuable basically then maturity is

97
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,060
not about technology we love the tech

98
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,430
obviously I mean we we all laugh pcaps

99
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,990
and we love to pick up wizards and we

100
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,090
need the tech but talking about maturity

101
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,950
is about talking about processes it's

102
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,480
about talking about government

103
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,079
governance you need to practice you need

104
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,019
to have your your your when the going

105
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,130
gets tough you need to know what you're

106
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,410
doing that's what what maturity maturity

107
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,000
is about and it's also about measuring

108
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,930
and Pru

109
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,540
your maturity and having a goal to watch

110
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,990
your maturity maturity level and also

111
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,479
make sure that you don't revert back to

112
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,460
a two-year-old's situation where you

113
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,370
have you set up your c-cert you've been

114
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,800
going at it for a number of years and

115
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,870
without knowing it without realizing it

116
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,539
you revert back to the the Caesar that

117
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:49,360
you were when you were 16 years ago not

118
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,400
very very mature so beware of the

119
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,750
Benjamin Button effect basically now as

120
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,030
to the why why we're doing this there's

121
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,639
a group of organizations and people it's

122
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,199
a bit of pity that the image is a bit

123
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,220
dark because we believe that there's a

124
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,510
group of people that work on this it's

125
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,940
first it's in Issa it's it's others more

126
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,699
on those organizations later but we

127
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:14,260
believe in an open and free and secure

128
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,330
internet and we believe that we cannot

129
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,130
do this alone that's why we believe that

130
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,560
we need to have teams stand on the

131
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,500
shoulders of giants where the Giants and

132
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,360
we hope that others will be able to

133
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,770
stand on our shoulders look further than

134
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,660
we have and set up quickly also we see

135
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,080
you need four four four more teams be it

136
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,060
legislation be it a government

137
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,280
assignment be it some something else

138
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,680
there's a great number of new and future

139
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,680
teams so there's a great need of more

140
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,490
information sharing and more helping

141
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,780
others set up now the last one which

142
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,250
ties in with the Benjamin Button

143
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,050
reference is the current approach might

144
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,539
not be as effective we have noticed as

145
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:01,990
NCHS as we thought so after going about

146
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,690
going at it for 18 years we now realize

147
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,550
that maybe you know we're still telling

148
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,560
people to do very basic stuff which

149
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,090
might not be the best so apparently

150
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,650
there's something wrong with our message

151
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,760
or there's something when you change

152
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,430
need to change in our message to help

153
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,479
our constituents

154
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,910
now there's a in the cset community and

155
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,320
in the security community there's a lot

156
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,270
going on about capacity building and

157
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,730
capacity building is a very wide term

158
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,090
and can basically seeing be seen as well

159
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,730
you can divide the activities into four

160
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,460
four basic topics that's polity policy

161
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,110
and strategy there's excellent people

162
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,240
working on in that area

163
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,850
there's matrix improvement as in laying

164
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,070
a mesh of C certs and security themes

165
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,760
over the world again helping us by

166
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,980
helping others and there's the

167
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,870
operations so how do you do the stuff

168
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,090
you need to be doing to keep your

169
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,420
constituency secure and in this talk

170
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,010
we're going to be focusing on C sub

171
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,690
maturity because that's the topic we've

172
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,890
been working with a great number of

173
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:09,000
people and we've seen an increased focus

174
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,270
in this area so these organizations have

175
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,880
all been active or are all active in

176
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,110
helping others become more mature and

177
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,810
we're talking about maturity it says

178
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,670
here is it's not about the technology

179
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,400
it's about how about the governance how

180
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,520
well does a team govern itself how will

181
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,980
this document itself how well does does

182
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,480
it measure itself how well does it look

183
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,250
at itself and make sure that you

184
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,840
actually do the stuff you need to be

185
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,720
doing on the other hand we are a bit of

186
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,860
a puzzle as teams so as a community here

187
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,790
we all know that the value of having a

188
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,950
security team or a C cert or a pset

189
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,900
however explaining this to your

190
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,340
management or through the board or to a

191
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,580
policy level we found a bit of a

192
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,700
challenge in that talking to them long

193
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,290
enough will eventually make it sink in

194
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,360
but for new teams it's very difficult to

195
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,850
explain why you need to spend a lot of

196
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,660
money to set up a team and not really

197
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,190
being able to explain what you get in

198
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,130
return for it some teams are very

199
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,960
fortunate I know of one team in my

200
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,580
country that also does fraud prevention

201
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,130
and you know doing fraud prevention

202
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,040
actually quantifies the return on

203
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,470
investment very very easily because you

204
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,980
can see the level the amount of money

205
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,649
going down you see

206
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:35,149
you see how much fraud you've prevented

207
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:37,779
but for a national team for example or a

208
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:40,369
government team you're just there to

209
00:08:40,369 --> 00:08:41,779
help people and you don't earn any money

210
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:45,199
so how do you go about explaining what

211
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:46,850
you do and why you need to do it also

212
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,300
not only for the money it's also about

213
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,679
explaining to your your your legal

214
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,209
counsel why you need to do the stuff you

215
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:55,100
need to do and how why it doesn't work

216
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,589
to simply sign a document and proof

217
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:00,559
there's also magic trusts you need to

218
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,350
invest in in your in your team you need

219
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,670
to invest in the relations so that

220
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,220
that's an interesting and interesting

221
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,990
discussion I've been having quite a lot

222
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,459
of discussions with my my legal counsel

223
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:15,550
because we're in this legislation path

224
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,110
and it really helps in having the

225
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,149
community behind me in bringing the

226
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:21,709
message saying that right what we've

227
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:24,350
done in the community actually this is

228
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,850
the the standard or this is going to

229
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:29,110
water standard and this is why

230
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,639
legislation will need to you know be

231
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,649
adapted to fit this and not the other

232
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:38,480
way around there have been a couple of

233
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,189
milestones done already this is

234
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:42,800
definitely not all of them what I can

235
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,870
tell you the first the first brush I had

236
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,189
with with cease at maturity was in 2006

237
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,379
I started working there in 2000 I've got

238
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:54,079
a gutter Tinnell in 2005 as Derek

239
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:57,379
already mentioned the first thing we did

240
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:59,059
when I was there is published the

241
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:02,660
certain books CD was actually a physical

242
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,209
CD it was tinned so you had this cute

243
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:06,769
little tin where you could you know take

244
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:08,990
the the the CV out put it in your very

245
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,670
old fashion that was very nice but it

246
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,290
explained the process of how go certain

247
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,269
L actually set up and something about

248
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:16,639
our legal processes and about how we go

249
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:23,420
about telling our constituency about the

250
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,569
threats about the visor EES then

251
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:28,519
obviously since 2008 there's the

252
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,709
sim-free model which is the the model

253
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:32,509
that will help a team a security team

254
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:36,619
measure and and get an insight into

255
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:38,839
their maturity it's the maturity model

256
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,600
that we've as DFC set and as trusted

257
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,509
introducer if adopted as certain l / NC

258
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:46,699
C and L we're quite proud to say that we

259
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:47,270
were

260
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,460
just want to be actually certified with

261
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,440
this model and it's proved to be a very

262
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,270
good basis for teams to measure

263
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,720
themselves now in the group of people

264
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,550
are the people that I mentioned before

265
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,430
that we're working together with we've

266
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,770
done a number of things those are the

267
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,810
things we've done something the GFC II

268
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,080
has done something with a an initiative

269
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,210
more on this a bit later we're thinking

270
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,550
about the typology for C search now this

271
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,710
is quite interesting and necessary even

272
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,060
though at first we didn't really expect

273
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,210
this then we thought about definition

274
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,830
for a national CSS so why would you need

275
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,710
a definition for a national C set but it

276
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,170
appears to be very useful or at least we

277
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,820
found so we've had a c-shape maturity

278
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,470
kit it says model here but it's it's a

279
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,630
kit really it's a document a guide of

280
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,150
guides basically to help others set up

281
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:42,200
which was published in the world in 2015

282
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,780
we had the global formal cyberspace in

283
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,250
The Hague and this is one of the

284
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,390
deliberative deliverables that we

285
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,370
published there helping other teams this

286
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,940
was done in the group as well and we've

287
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,950
been publishing a baseline so helping

288
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:59,660
others form a roadmap basically for for

289
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,090
the levels that they want to go to we've

290
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,310
been involved in various global and

291
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,470
regional activities so helping C search

292
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,090
and giving them the materials that we've

293
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,620
been creating and speaking to them

294
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,540
reaching out asking them what they need

295
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,220
and at the end there's the GFC manifesto

296
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,700
which is basically a nice bow around the

297
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,730
around the documents around the stuff

298
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,380
that is going to be drawn up by the GFC

299
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,320
e that's a lot of policy work a lot of

300
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,570
legal work still it's very necessary to

301
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,400
get the the buy-in from the right levels

302
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,970
and the potential next step is giving

303
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,250
more handle to you know the tools that

304
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:43,910
new and future teams can actually use so

305
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,000
to to place it in an order this is

306
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,270
basically the the picture first you need

307
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,060
the typology because you need to know

308
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,820
which type of cset there there are then

309
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,540
you'd like to know

310
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,340
alright I'm this type of C said what do

311
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,780
I need to do then what's my definition

312
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,250
then based on the definition

313
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,840
might want to think about what service

314
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,550
good services could I provide to my

315
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,370
constituency and then how do I go about

316
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,280
filling in this task of offering these

317
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,260
services and making a resilient

318
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,420
organization and then helping with that

319
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,470
it's the baseline now as I said the bow

320
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,060
around this is going to be the GSE

321
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,460
manifesto which will probably be

322
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,170
published somewhere later this year or

323
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,660
maybe started next year and the very

324
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,520
solid and firm basis for all this work

325
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:35,120
is the sim free model in 2015 we had the

326
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,030
global form of cyber expertise in sorry

327
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,590
the global conference of cyberspace in

328
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:43,910
Holland in The Hague and we as a

329
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,710
deliverable we delivered the global

330
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,480
forum on cyber expertise so that's a

331
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,370
podium basically where organizations and

332
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,610
countries can start initiatives on

333
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,510
particular topics with a group initially

334
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:00,890
starting as Microsoft OAS ITU and the

335
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,230
Netherlands and Dutch government we

336
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,210
started the CSF maturity initiative and

337
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,260
fortunately the group grew very quickly

338
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,540
and we reigned at as I said policy and

339
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,490
board level to make sure that the red

340
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,530
message and the lens lands at the right

341
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:19,760
level we've had a number of expert

342
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,230
meetings where we discussed various

343
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,530
topics so for example all the topics you

344
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,570
saw just now we discussed why would this

345
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,980
be necessary why would this be relevant

346
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,440
and what is already there because last

347
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,660
week last thing we want to do is use or

348
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,490
reinvent the wheel we want to use the

349
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,750
stuff that's already there and we also

350
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,430
want to align with the stuff with the

351
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,319
initiatives that have been going on

352
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:49,019
as to the typology it's good to know

353
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:53,250
what type of c-cert P cert security team

354
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,319
you are because it gives you an identity

355
00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:58,500
and it it allows you to base your your

356
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,540
your founding documents on so for

357
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,009
example in my case I work for the

358
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:05,670
national government national C shirt of

359
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,879
the Netherlands and doing this knowing

360
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:11,610
motor national C 30s more or less

361
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,730
I can tell my my constituents and my my

362
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,459
management what we need to be doing

363
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:20,100
we're currently working on a document to

364
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,899
describe what types of csepp the really

365
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:23,250
are so we've got the national ones

366
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,389
you've got the product search you've got

367
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:26,279
the regional search equal the sectoral

368
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,470
search and there's a bit of a movement

369
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,750
that proves the or at least in Holland

370
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,790
that proves the value of this piece of

371
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,189
text and that is that we see sectoral

372
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:37,319
search program for example the care the

373
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:42,389
care sector is now unifying or combining

374
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:45,000
themselves in image search so we'd like

375
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,930
to help them by providing documents and

376
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,730
providing guidance on how to set up a

377
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,899
search but they need to know what they

378
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,579
are first so they know what services

379
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,220
they can they can provide the direct

380
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,500
constituency then it helps to have a

381
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,259
definition and there have been many

382
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:06,389
there are many descriptions over

383
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:08,250
national sisa but no one really knows

384
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,240
what they really are

385
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,730
it's if you are asked 10 people you get

386
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,259
10 different definitions of national

387
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:14,930
c-cert there have been excellent

388
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,759
documents written by excellent and very

389
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,009
experienced organizations so for example

390
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:21,660
it's the Carnegie Mellon Institute that

391
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,360
wrote in their in their steps for

392
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,040
creating national see set a good

393
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,569
description of what a national secret is

394
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,339
in these has got their take on a

395
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,829
national see shirt ITU is got their own

396
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:33,420
take on the national seater but there's

397
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:38,040
not one one accepted basically by the

398
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,180
government or by the by the community

399
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,500
definition of national ceaseth map this

400
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,329
is relevant for the people in europe

401
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:47,160
because we've got an NIS to directive

402
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,490
which is the network information

403
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,829
security directive that explains how the

404
00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:54,779
28 member states need to go about

405
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,809
securing their stuff in holland we feel

406
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:58,590
the same pain

407
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,210
we've got local legislation coming our

408
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,100
way which is excellent which really

409
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,420
defines what we're allowed to do but we

410
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,980
consider ourselves to be the National

411
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,480
c-cert and our lawyers say well yeah

412
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,099
right that's fine tell me what is the

413
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,170
national seat and we say we don't really

414
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,569
know because there's no text saying this

415
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,040
is the National ceaseth and we start

416
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,560
talking to your legal counsel we think

417
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,790
it's this and this yeah that's very nice

418
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,470
what you think but what is the

419
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,020
established text say so that's why we're

420
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,960
working on this definition and we're

421
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,780
looking to do more definitions as soon

422
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,490
as we have the typology and identified a

423
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,030
number of other types of C code

424
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,680
obviously as soon as we have a text

425
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,060
which is being drafted right now or

426
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,950
somewhere in DES in the near future

427
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,900
we're going to do the you know the

428
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,470
process of establishing of asking for

429
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,440
feedback and asking your opinion on what

430
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,570
do you think it's the Nationals he said

431
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,190
definition is this a good one and this

432
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,080
is the one you feel do we have consensus

433
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,150
on this definition so it's going to take

434
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,770
a while before we actually get consensus

435
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,240
but we think it's really important that

436
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,280
the first community agrees with this

437
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,010
definition simply because it helps us

438
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,620
the services framework originally

439
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,460
included in the 2003 I believe document

440
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,260
of the Carnegie Mellon Institute

441
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,540
explains the services that c-cert can

442
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,930
offer to its constituents now the text

443
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,540
is old and first has started an

444
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,240
initiative were an action couple years

445
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,300
ago with the education summit where we

446
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,790
started to redefine the services

447
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,040
framework that was a very thorough and

448
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,500
very good a very wide discussion where

449
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,480
we went back to the definitions of what

450
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,270
is a service what is an action how do

451
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,160
they relate to each other and the old

452
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,280
services are they complete and if so how

453
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,740
did they is a service or is it merely an

454
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,960
action and how do we describe that on

455
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,110
the 24th of May the 1.1 version of this

456
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,700
document was published and this is a

457
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,310
document that came about in excellent

458
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:06,450
discussions with a lot of you in the

459
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,010
room we've had a number of meetings over

460
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,070
over the last couple years so this is

461
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,480
something to build on West

462
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,410
cutting up a new set or helping recently

463
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:25,770
started upset during the GCC s as I said

464
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,980
we published a document geared towards

465
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,760
helping starting and new C search setup

466
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,980
so what we did is we took the experience

467
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,720
we let try to leverage the experience

468
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,160
from all the people that cooperated on

469
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,600
this and it's a wide group I've got a

470
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,040
list of people that cooperated on it a

471
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,940
bit later on it's a very wide group of

472
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,540
people and and they all lent us their

473
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,480
experience so basically what this

474
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,970
document became is a guide of guides so

475
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,230
we didn't write anything new we just

476
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,480
pointed towards existing documents the

477
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,330
the right and and established documents

478
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,770
that are still being maintained by the

479
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,559
teams and in this way combining years

480
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,750
and years of experience in one guide

481
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,419
what we also did is provide a solid

482
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:11,970
foundation so that sim-free model is the

483
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,730
foundation for this document allowing

484
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,320
people to at least have a bit of

485
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,210
structure have some guidance in the sim

486
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,360
3 maturity model and should they

487
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,330
consider certification or peer review or

488
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,640
a very kind they've got they've

489
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,280
pre-sorted because of the structure they

490
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,530
used to set up the pre-sorted for you

491
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,630
know being able to do this the

492
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,470
assessments what it also does is it

493
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,780
provides case studies so all the errors

494
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,720
that we've made as established teams

495
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,790
they should at least be aware of them

496
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,169
they need to make them state obviously

497
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:47,970
but you need to have someone around when

498
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,760
you recover from them these were also

499
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,470
are also described in this document and

500
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,120
one more thing is that there are some

501
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,250
stuff that is kept under the radar or is

502
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,690
really easy to forget when you're

503
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,520
starting up so for example your legal

504
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,929
stuff your communication stuff how do

505
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,710
you how do you involve your legal

506
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,290
friends this is described in there as

507
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,059
well because it's one of the it's it's

508
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,530
some of the things you need to be doing

509
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,150
if you want to have a solid foundation

510
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,370
to build your your your C cert upon

511
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,260
before you start offering services to

512
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,580
your constituency and again this was you

513
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,169
know the only way to go about this sort

514
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:26,190
of stuff is to use it

515
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,110
mutti and and use the experience in the

516
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,500
community to make sure that you have a

517
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,490
decent and a sturdy document that allows

518
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:40,549
people to learn from others and

519
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,960
obviously we all know I mean beginning

520
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,269
is tough but when we started out we you

521
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:48,019
know invented the wheel ourselves we we

522
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:52,139
we borrowed our CMS from from all set

523
00:21:52,139 --> 00:21:55,110
for example so anything we needed to do

524
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:59,009
we did and we've made mistakes and now

525
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:00,509
we're helping others trying to recover

526
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:03,570
from those mistakes as well and it's a

527
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,970
matter of you know repeating the stuff

528
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,080
you do the cake here is was what the

529
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,029
picture was sent to me by our Gautham

530
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:14,159
probably many of you know him he used to

531
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,559
work for goo certain L and n CH CN l he

532
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,690
moved on to a different company a

533
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,750
company that was not very aware of

534
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,100
security and was not very resilient in

535
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,230
that way though they deal with lots of

536
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,440
money he was able to convince them to

537
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,340
set up a C set and that's not a not a

538
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,259
not a trivial feat because those people

539
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:36,210
didn't really realized what the c-cert

540
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,129
community was they didn't really know

541
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:40,169
why you need to be aware of the threat

542
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:41,970
from outside and what how you could

543
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,919
leverage the community in doing the

544
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,289
stuff you do so within a couple of

545
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:50,059
months using the document that document

546
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:54,809
he was able to have a mandate from from

547
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:57,120
from the board have his documents have

548
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,610
is his processes rubber-stamped have

549
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:04,320
this first exercises planned have a PGP

550
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,509
not only agreed but also a process of

551
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:08,309
generating the key and he scored the

552
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:12,720
cake and at least in Holland we think

553
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,509
cake is is the cornerstone of running

554
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:17,789
our C shirt because we have so much cake

555
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:19,889
that we often feel that as soon as the

556
00:23:19,889 --> 00:23:22,169
cake leaves Holland will fall basically

557
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:23,580
it's a bit like the ravenson in the

558
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,320
Tower of London as soon as the Ravens

559
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,440
leave England will fall us no we so we

560
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,549
keep pushing cake

561
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,150
measuring your stuff measuring what

562
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,710
you're doing is very important so in

563
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,540
this race that we did as you can see

564
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,260
here the this is a schedule of all the

565
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,330
changing points where the old team of

566
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,890
runners meets the new team of runners

567
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,740
you need to maintain a steady 11.3 ke

568
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,260
per hour to make sure that you make

569
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:56,760
those points at those times you need to

570
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,690
in the process

571
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,130
I mean preparing for this run takes

572
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,510
about a year and in the process you need

573
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,910
to measure that the speed of your of

574
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:05,760
your runners of your cyclist because you

575
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,900
need to know whether or not you're going

576
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,640
to make this and same holds true for a

577
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,710
CE set if you've got your goal and if

578
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,300
you if you know where you want to be if

579
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,220
you want to have a particular level of

580
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,160
maturity you need to keep measuring the

581
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,290
points in between and being very

582
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:24,770
critical in the process and that's why

583
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,600
there has been a working group in the

584
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,440
EUC search network that deals with a

585
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,920
baseline based on the sim free model

586
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:41,120
there's a set of values that you need to

587
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,470
get for particular there ok there are 44

588
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:49,560
variables in the in the sim 3 model and

589
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,570
for each of those variables you can have

590
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,800
either a score of 1 through 4 and where

591
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,070
for being the best or 0 through 4 and 0

592
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,750
being non-existent and for being the

593
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,240
best more on this a bit later so for a

594
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,070
national a government secret we've

595
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,700
actually defined those levels and that

596
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,980
helps new and starting teams because

597
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,350
they in that way they know where to aim

598
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,290
their focus where to where to you know

599
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,050
invest more time or think right we're at

600
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,450
the right level at the moment

601
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,920
what's also included in the written

602
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,080
there in the in the baseline is that

603
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,220
there is a possibility for either

604
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,590
self-assessment which is always good but

605
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,630
also a peer review so if there's a

606
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,230
particular team you trust or you can ask

607
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,330
them in and show them your processes if

608
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,590
there's particular team you don't trust

609
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,600
and you don't want to have them in your

610
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,220
organization just leave them out you can

611
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,720
in any way you like

612
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,549
we measure measure your own progress

613
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:51,220
what this helps is it helps provide a

614
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,080
roadmap so if you measure yourself and

615
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,450
you you discover I'm not a basic where

616
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,159
I'm at a basic level at the moment and

617
00:25:57,159 --> 00:25:59,220
I'd like to be in the intermediate level

618
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,710
you know which variables were which

619
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,600
which parameters you need to improve on

620
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,270
so that gives you basically the roadmap

621
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,010
towards the next level of certification

622
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:13,960
and even though it's created for the UC

623
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,120
search network obviously it's open for

624
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,500
all you know reach out to me in after

625
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,520
the talk if you'd like to know more

626
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,080
about this or reach out to any of the

627
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,929
team more names on the board later if

628
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:27,100
you'd like to know more about this

629
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,679
because it really helps teams as a whole

630
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,840
to measure their maturity this is the

631
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,030
template for a government / national

632
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,580
team so any government / national team

633
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:45,010
they can basically start learning how

634
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:48,970
they stand are they basic level of

635
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,380
maturity intermediate level of maturity

636
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,860
or certifiable level of maturity and

637
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,890
these are the 44 or 45 questions each

638
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,710
with the value that you need to score in

639
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,780
order to main to to achieve a particular

640
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:06,750
level of maturity now some one example

641
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,210
this is a question on service

642
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:12,340
description so it's completely legible

643
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,679
so I'll read out the first sentence what

644
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:17,289
services are you what are the services

645
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:19,270
that your C cert offers offers to their

646
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:19,960
constituency

647
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,110
do you have it clearly described do you

648
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,419
know implicitly but don't talk about it

649
00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:27,010
do you actually talk about it so each of

650
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,650
the levels you can see the values there

651
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,490
so value one is no it's never discussed

652
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:35,620
value two is we know what we offer but

653
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,640
we don't really we haven't really

654
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,539
written it down level two is yes we have

655
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:42,159
written it down but it you know it's

656
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,490
just an informal document level three is

657
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,049
yes we've written it down we've

658
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:48,760
published it and everyone knows that in

659
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,860
the organization so if you don't comply

660
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,370
with it we'll have a good discussion and

661
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,230
level four is the same as level three

662
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,610
but then with the

663
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,580
rubber-stamped the the annual audit and

664
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,830
the the assessment going on on this

665
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,730
level and if you go about answering all

666
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,100
the 4445 questions you get an idea of

667
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,380
how your spider graph will actually look

668
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:18,030
for your organization all these

669
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,920
experiments and activities and pieces of

670
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,950
text are very good and well we've also

671
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,530
done or at least the GFC as has taken up

672
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:30,790
the task of visiting regions and and

673
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:36,070
countries and setting up meetings for

674
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,330
example a couple you a couple years ago

675
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,680
or sort of I think about a year ago

676
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,080
something we went to to western Africa

677
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,110
there was in Senegal there was a

678
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,670
regional meeting for the huge te where

679
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,190
we met loads of countries their

680
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,660
ministers and the people working on

681
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,700
cybersecurity and we spoke to them about

682
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,740
these initiatives about how do you

683
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,080
measure your current worth how do you

684
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,290
you know how do you know how fertile the

685
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,940
bottom is that you're going to plant a

686
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,090
seaport on how do you know how it's

687
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,010
going to land with policy do you have a

688
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,960
policy do you have a national

689
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,170
cybersecurity strategy for example it

690
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,970
really helps in getting an overview on

691
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:16,240
the on the countries where they're

692
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,950
standing what we noticed even even

693
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,990
countries that have had major issues in

694
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,420
the past also in western Africa they're

695
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,700
now very much aware of the need for

696
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,800
cyber security because be it because

697
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,960
they see money hemorrhaging away from

698
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,690
their country because of fraud or be it

699
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,840
because they see cyber security sorry

700
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,170
the internet as being as being the the

701
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,550
stimulus for growth in the country

702
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,560
economic growth for example they see the

703
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,900
need for setting up a see set and that's

704
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,460
why we as a community I think need to

705
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:49,090
help them set up another good thing

706
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,300
which is a bit slow at the moment but it

707
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,550
will probably speed up again in some

708
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,980
time is that the EU the European Union

709
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,220
European Union has been working on a

710
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,200
tender for for helping a couple of

711
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,960
countries worldwide set up their seat as

712
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,550
well so here's another initiative where

713
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:09,400
we can see that Europe is also seeing

714
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,470
the need for helping others set up

715
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,090
and helping country set up making

716
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,789
effectively our job a lot easier if they

717
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:21,549
grow to a certain level of maturity now

718
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:24,669
as this is a complete you know they're

719
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:26,710
they're loose activities basically so

720
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,539
what the GFC is doing at the moment is

721
00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:30,520
they're tying a bow around the work

722
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,799
we've been doing making nice making it a

723
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,049
nice policy document which were why in

724
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:37,780
my case it will help me convince our

725
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,730
policy level saying this is what we need

726
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,650
to do this is why we need to invest but

727
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,720
also it might help convince the policy

728
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,280
level of the countries that are in need

729
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,929
of a seat at a national secret or any

730
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:49,990
other type of seizure to set up and do

731
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,210
the investment because you know doing

732
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,500
the investment getting the money for

733
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,429
something that you don't really know

734
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:56,950
what's going to gonna it's not going to

735
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,740
contribute to your core business and it

736
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,070
costs a lot of money so it's it's this

737
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,480
will probably help bring across the

738
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,159
message why it's important having said

739
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:12,130
that that this was all for teams that

740
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,720
are only starting their lessons

741
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,140
basically now looking at myself we've

742
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,090
been as a team active for about eighteen

743
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:22,419
years I've been involved in a team for

744
00:31:22,419 --> 00:31:26,890
about twelve and I must say probably

745
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,450
holds true for largely here as well

746
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,950
there are many many established teams

747
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,919
and we have years of experience so we've

748
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:34,600
been working together for for a great

749
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,000
number of years and we've been doing all

750
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,470
the stuff that we need to do we've been

751
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,210
we've got a process if we've been we've

752
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,710
been measure measuring our maturity

753
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,510
we've been looking at ourselves we've

754
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:47,140
been doing the practice and yet that

755
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,850
might not be enough because we noticed

756
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,860
some stuff recently or over the last

757
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,289
year that made me think that we might

758
00:31:53,289 --> 00:31:56,169
not be doing the right things per se we

759
00:31:56,169 --> 00:31:59,520
might need to change our approach a bit

760
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,179
this looks quite easy the process of you

761
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:07,600
know one runner running for 2k tagging

762
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,750
next the next runner and after 2k the

763
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,120
the person gets into a bus 2k further

764
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,799
down the road the the next run will be

765
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,580
tagged again the more complex thing is

766
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,620
where the the vans are not allowed on

767
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,260
the on the course of the row per run so

768
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,570
there you need to have three bikes

769
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,910
for runners and each runner does 2k

770
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,950
takes a bike next runner goes the Tetra

771
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,620
these processes need to need to be

772
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,990
practiced especially because you know

773
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,760
theoretically they're quite alright but

774
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,080
when you're there in north of Paris and

775
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,810
it's rush hour and it's very busy and

776
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:43,480
you're tired and you know you're pumped

777
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,270
up because you're going to do this run

778
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,410
life is a bit more difficult although

779
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,780
the basic stuff is not as easy as it

780
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,060
once seemed and I think the same holds

781
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,570
true for for running a C sir so when for

782
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,970
example mayor of a municipality or if if

783
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,940
the board is is breathing down your neck

784
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,740
and saying can we work again tomorrow

785
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,460
morning life is not as simple as simply

786
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,290
resolving an incident so that's why you

787
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,760
need to practice you mean you need to

788
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,470
not think at that moment you need to

789
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,700
have thought before that so that you

790
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,170
know your hands will do the automatic

791
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,390
automatic work when you're going is

792
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:21,580
stuff for ourselves this is a very old e

793
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,830
I'm terribly sorry to reuse this again

794
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:27,040
because it's been way overused but still

795
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,300
this was a moment where we thought

796
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,850
alright this is interesting you can

797
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:33,700
alter 2011 that was the only national

798
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,670
crisis that the Netherlands had that was

799
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:40,810
caused by the one of the root

800
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:44,320
certificate providers they got

801
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,590
compromised big time and in the

802
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,150
beginning we thought well you know we're

803
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,040
going to handle this as an incident and

804
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,050
shouldn't be a problem

805
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:55,480
then after handling the incident for

806
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,010
about three days we started to notice

807
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:59,290
that our inocent handler or the the

808
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:02,410
manager the the overall work he started

809
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,840
to look really really ill because he'd

810
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,610
been working for three days non-stop and

811
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,920
then we realized we might want to need

812
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,690
to send him home and oh yeah better

813
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:13,090
perhaps all the sweet stuff that we have

814
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,280
there might not be the best food for

815
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,719
Hamling an instance so the sugar fibre

816
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,120
ratio was a bit on the sweet side and

817
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,000
this is the stuff we learned when we

818
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:29,070
dealt with this this incident so

819
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,639
what a boss answer basically is that you

820
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,590
need to see the bigger picture you need

821
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:36,110
to be able to realize that it's it's not

822
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,370
in the process you need to see the

823
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:39,139
outside world in the case of the anohter

824
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:41,030
for example with the world this is you

825
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,679
know it's sad that you won't be able to

826
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,780
talk to our local IRS anymore on a

827
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,000
secure way and then we start to realize

828
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,530
that it's more than just the IRS it's

829
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:56,480
also the communications between our in

830
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,240
the harbour of Rotterdam so they need to

831
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,550
talk to our customs department and if

832
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,820
that communications doesn't cannot be

833
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,980
guaranteed anymore and if the trust in

834
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,330
the certificates are revoked

835
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,040
we simply cannot get the stuff into

836
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,350
Holland same goes for passengers through

837
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:15,350
our National Airport so they talk they

838
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:18,080
talk to customs in a secured way if we

839
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,440
can't have flights enter and and and and

840
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,540
leave our country that's going to have a

841
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,550
major impact on our in our organization

842
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,140
so it took us a while to see the bigger

843
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,780
picture there and what we also realized

844
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:33,460
is that we needed to very quickly start

845
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,380
onboarding friends so we started on

846
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,960
boarding our DoD cert for example to to

847
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,270
maintain the daily operations we started

848
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,490
to get people from from one of our

849
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:46,190
national PKI providers to start

850
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:49,280
reviewing and writing the stuff on on

851
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,100
pacaya PKI what was actually going on

852
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,620
because we had no PKI experts at the

853
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,920
moment but we knew where to get the get

854
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,080
the information so what we saw there is

855
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,560
the the bigger picture is really about

856
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,270
including the friends that you have and

857
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:08,960
also seeing your your the stuff that you

858
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,460
haven't arranged yet another example in

859
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,860
this case is a good friend of the show

860
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,920
of the NCC that we do a lot of work with

861
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,240
gave me an example in that they received

862
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,880
a threat a cyber security threat on one

863
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,250
of their plants they've got plants

864
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,880
across Europe and there's a lot of ICS

865
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,530
SCADA stuff going on there on those

866
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,270
plants and they received threats saying

867
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:38,090
right we've got this ICT threat with

868
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,100
there's probably a possibly violence

869
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,920
actor that is about to do some stuff

870
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,700
what they did is they

871
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,070
simply sending the IT guy or the the

872
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,349
instant responder they sent along with

873
00:36:48,349 --> 00:36:50,270
him the center team of physical security

874
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:53,690
experts and ICS Kader experts when they

875
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:56,359
went to the site they didn't really see

876
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:58,970
the actual threat but they saw issues so

877
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:02,030
they started measuring the Wi-Fi network

878
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,530
in relation to the physical perimeter

879
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,540
for example they started looking at the

880
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,579
at the ICS scalar components how does it

881
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:10,040
fit in with the rest of the IT stuff and

882
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,400
what they and it ended up with was a set

883
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,160
of recommendations not so much for the

884
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,839
for the IT staff which would not really

885
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,270
land it in the organization itself but

886
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,349
they saw the bigger picture and they

887
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:24,920
were able to have set of recommendations

888
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,250
that was applicable to the whole hold

889
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,109
the organization and also for more than

890
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:34,160
one plant so taking care of their

891
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,810
neighbors they also thought about right

892
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,980
we've got a number of plants that have

893
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,910
the same set up more or less and we need

894
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:43,490
to secure them in this way so helping

895
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,170
your neighbors and and and making sure

896
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,760
that you see the bigger picture and

897
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,770
including all the people that's a good

898
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,690
thing that's one of the signs of

899
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:55,310
maturity and as I said just now got sure

900
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:58,160
to nail started up as a very immature

901
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,160
team obviously we had help from great

902
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,200
friends many of whom are actually in the

903
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,380
room but we started you know making

904
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:11,150
making errors and making running into

905
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,250
things and and granted for some some

906
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,290
issues you need to you know fall down

907
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,180
and recover again because that's the

908
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,490
only way to learn but some stuff you can

909
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,920
we can help you with so for example we

910
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,640
had the tech only view we we did start

911
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,290
writing procedures for each and every

912
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,569
new type of incident that we've that we

913
00:38:29,569 --> 00:38:32,089
ran into we had no idea what we were

914
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:34,040
doing basically and now that we know we

915
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,270
it's it's good to have written them down

916
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,760
and help others prevent those you know

917
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,329
rookie start

918
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,000
over the last couple of years in order

919
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,750
to become a bit more mature what we did

920
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,730
is a couple of steps so we had the

921
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,350
formal inspection of our advisories our

922
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:57,480
tech advisories which was done by a

923
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,490
formal inspection body in the Dutch

924
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:02,070
government and all the stuff they told

925
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,590
us about is the stuff that we have been

926
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,720
changing in our tech advisories so

927
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,350
having a good look at ourselves we are

928
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,600
currently in the next week we're up for

929
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,690
the second recertification of the sim 3

930
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,360
certification which is having a thorough

931
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,880
look at yourself as well so making sure

932
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,010
that you have your processes in place

933
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,740
etc make sure you don't revert back to

934
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,580
the situation of couple years ago we had

935
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,830
the 24/7 seven operations which was

936
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:36,270
interesting we invested a year and a

937
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,610
half in setting it up doing it and

938
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,560
discovering that we were not ready for

939
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,500
24/7 operations on-site because simply

940
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,020
with our constituency there were there

941
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,520
was there were not enough incidents

942
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,120
there were serious enough to have

943
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,890
well-educated very critical and very

944
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:58,980
technically sound staff on-site so with

945
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,250
the risk of boring those people away and

946
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,300
with the risk of you know not being able

947
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,250
to being able to find skilled IT

948
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,290
security staff

949
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:10,050
we decided on government management

950
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:13,530
decided to roll back the the decision to

951
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,960
not do 24/7 operations anymore

952
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,770
we are 24/7 available and we are 24/7

953
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:21,810
reachable in the sense that any any

954
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,670
keywords that pop up in our in our

955
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,740
mailbox or our other systems you know

956
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,630
they make sure that someone gets called

957
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,730
awake but we have now extended office

958
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:32,280
hours so again a very critical look at

959
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,820
ourselves we increase the talk to our

960
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,510
constituency we are currently working on

961
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:42,600
a national detection network which is

962
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,090
key in actually seeing what's going on

963
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,070
in your constituency networks because

964
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,720
otherwise you're blind we also doing

965
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,110
stuff in threat Intel etc so we're

966
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,540
improving there as well seeing or you

967
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,690
know improving the

968
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:58,000
what we see and being able to respond

969
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,660
more quickly we have a very close

970
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,550
relationship with our constituency and

971
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,290
we have liaisons that visit us about

972
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,569
every week so liaisons from various

973
00:41:07,569 --> 00:41:09,700
sectors from other government

974
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,800
organizations etc and we share

975
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:18,250
information about very current affair so

976
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,510
for example if we have something that

977
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,599
might you know reek of espionage we

978
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:24,130
start calling the Secret Service our

979
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,720
Secret Service or if it might be

980
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,599
something that has something to do with

981
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,250
cyber crime we've got the police

982
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,670
department on speed dial for example

983
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:36,460
also as I mentioned we've got specific

984
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,079
legislation coming our way which means

985
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:43,810
that we're going towards the NIS

986
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:44,920
directive we've got our Dutch

987
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,079
translation our local law for this which

988
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:49,300
means that we're allowed to deal with

989
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,250
particular kinds of personal information

990
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:54,190
which is also regulated in the general

991
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:57,970
data protection regulation in the EU and

992
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,430
it's only going to get more strict so we

993
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,609
have it embedded in the law that we're

994
00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:05,020
allowed to do a particular stuff when we

995
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,060
need to do particular stuff and we also

996
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,730
have a particular exempt from we're

997
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,859
exempted from from the FOIA which means

998
00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:14,260
that in particular situations we're not

999
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,960
even allowed to give information when we

1000
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,119
receive a Freedom of Information Act

1001
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,880
request so that's all very good it's all

1002
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,480
it's all you know we're doing our work

1003
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,700
what we notice is that we might not be

1004
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,410
reaching our constituency really well

1005
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:30,940
because you probably recognize that

1006
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,099
picture there as well during the one a

1007
00:42:33,099 --> 00:42:37,359
cry thing we still needed to tell to

1008
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,160
tell organisations that they needed to

1009
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:43,599
patch so it's it's a we got the feeling

1010
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,430
do we really reach out to our

1011
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,140
constituency enough and do we really get

1012
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:54,099
the message across also looking back to

1013
00:42:54,099 --> 00:42:55,750
the real work that there have been a lot

1014
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,119
of changes so we've been doing all the

1015
00:42:58,119 --> 00:42:59,859
good stuff the stuff on the previous

1016
00:42:59,859 --> 00:43:01,060
slide we've been looking at ourselves

1017
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,619
and we've been you know working on

1018
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:05,109
ourselves but we fail to look outside as

1019
00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:07,390
well we fail to really listen to the

1020
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:09,510
constituency so we received quest

1021
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:11,460
about when can we actually give you a

1022
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,550
call what can you do for me which

1023
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,830
shocked us a bit because we were under

1024
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:18,300
the impression that we were really

1025
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,890
reaching out to them and we really had

1026
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:22,380
good discussions on what we could do for

1027
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:26,280
them without us noticing we also noticed

1028
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,210
that the well we saw that the the

1029
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,290
constituency obviously became more

1030
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:32,970
mature so they need different sets of

1031
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:36,450
information from us there's also a big

1032
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:40,920
swing towards larger organizations have

1033
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,990
their sock security operation center

1034
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:44,760
they become more mature so they need a

1035
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,350
different way of interacting with the

1036
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:50,280
sea shirt to you know get the same value

1037
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,480
that we used to offer to other

1038
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,480
organizations our constituency most of

1039
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,280
them are getting more mature as well so

1040
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,020
all the stuff we keep pushing out on a

1041
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,609
daily basis with all the details about

1042
00:43:59,609 --> 00:44:01,890
you know for example run-of-the-mill of

1043
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,480
vulnerabilities do we really need to do

1044
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:12,540
that also one one issue is that becoming

1045
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,730
more mature and becoming more embedded

1046
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:17,820
in our ministry is that we could become

1047
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,880
more accountable as well and that is

1048
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,340
painful in the sense that we notice that

1049
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,890
a simple letter of intent for example

1050
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:27,869
someone presented us with the letter of

1051
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:30,330
intent recently could you please help us

1052
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:32,100
with this project and we said yes we'd

1053
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,650
love to really we'd love to however you

1054
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,930
need a signature that's difficult

1055
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:40,590
because in our ministry we've got two

1056
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:43,200
towers the one is the Ministry of Safety

1057
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,180
and justice and there are about two and

1058
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,980
a half thousand lawyers in that tower

1059
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,090
and that's where I work

1060
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:51,600
so lawyers and signatures that's

1061
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,960
difficult so and that's challenging

1062
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,580
because if you want to you want to

1063
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,470
improve your stuff if you want to

1064
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:02,190
cooperate on on projects you need to

1065
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:05,250
work together in a more spontaneous way

1066
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:07,109
you need to be able to you know say yes

1067
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:08,760
I'll be able to do this without going

1068
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,750
through layers and layers of lawyers

1069
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,190
that don't get me wrong I you know

1070
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:12,660
lawyers are our best friends because we

1071
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:16,260
they keep us from breaking the law but

1072
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,540
it would be really good to to be a bit

1073
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,140
more flexible

1074
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:24,540
and I know this sounds all very bad but

1075
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,430
it's not all bad so we've got we had a

1076
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:28,890
couple of very good examples where we

1077
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,990
thought right we might be doing the

1078
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:33,630
right things you probably recognize the

1079
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,340
gentleman there it's mr. Holden a couple

1080
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,590
years ago yet the he found an enormous

1081
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:40,619
dataset online with lots of personal

1082
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:43,710
information and we handled this as an

1083
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,180
incident so we asked him could we please

1084
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,670
have the information for Enel because

1085
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:50,460
that really helped us help our country

1086
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,920
and our constituency he said yes sure

1087
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,690
there you go and before we know it we

1088
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:56,790
were stuck with in enormous database

1089
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,900
personal information so that's when we

1090
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,070
rediscovered our policy department and

1091
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:04,800
our legal department and said yeah this

1092
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,270
is all very good and we need to help our

1093
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:08,490
constituency but if you share it any

1094
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:10,770
wider than our constituency we're

1095
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:12,180
breaking the law and that's not a good

1096
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,970
thing so together with with our legal

1097
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:16,830
department we were able to find a way of

1098
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:18,900
still spreading the information we need

1099
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,820
it to spread without actually breaking

1100
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,580
the law too much so we used good friends

1101
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:27,240
partners to disseminate the information

1102
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,609
for each each for our own own

1103
00:46:29,609 --> 00:46:35,160
constituency also the I like the IE one

1104
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,380
IE had a vulnerability a couple years

1105
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,240
ago which was a run-of-the-mill

1106
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,849
vulnerability we noticed that the

1107
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:43,500
vulnerability you know in in our matrix

1108
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,390
in our in our set of in our assessment

1109
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:47,700
we said it's medium probability that

1110
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,260
this will will be exploited and when

1111
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,780
it's exploited it will have medium

1112
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,630
damage our Parliament didn't really

1113
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,310
agree so they started asking questions

1114
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:58,740
in Parliament why did the NCSC say it's

1115
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,300
only a medium medium vulnerability

1116
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:04,230
because etc and why haven't you told

1117
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,869
people to migrate to Firefox Google

1118
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:09,810
Chrome or any different browser and

1119
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:12,060
that's why we also had the help from our

1120
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,410
policy department our policy department

1121
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:15,270
is very close to us

1122
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:19,080
and we find them very easily so it's

1123
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,000
very easy to you know just walk over to

1124
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,060
their desk and ask for their help in in

1125
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,940
these cases so that's that's one extra

1126
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:30,540
step of maturity basically that we've

1127
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:33,390
noticed and I'm not sure if you know him

1128
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:35,430
he's the patron saint of the Internet

1129
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:38,779
send ez door we've got our national

1130
00:47:38,779 --> 00:47:42,380
exercise come up coming up this year

1131
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:45,869
it's called ez door and we're including

1132
00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:48,359
the rest of the community basically it's

1133
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:51,450
about 42 organizations that deal with

1134
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:52,980
cybersecurity in Holland they're all

1135
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:57,390
included and we're practicing

1136
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:59,369
the lines of communication lines between

1137
00:47:59,369 --> 00:48:01,799
the organization's up to the ministerial

1138
00:48:01,799 --> 00:48:04,589
level so across the country the main

1139
00:48:04,589 --> 00:48:07,109
players are some of the key players will

1140
00:48:07,109 --> 00:48:09,480
actually be involved in practice or in

1141
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,130
the in the exercise that we're running

1142
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:12,839
so that's another sign of maturity

1143
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:16,890
I hope additionally this is all very

1144
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:20,490
boring but we're part of the national

1145
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:21,839
crisis structure which means that we

1146
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,519
also have a set of a predefined set of

1147
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:26,119
roles and we have a predefined set of

1148
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:28,950
exercises per role in the crisis

1149
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:32,749
structure so we know what we need to do

1150
00:48:32,749 --> 00:48:35,880
before acts there's an actual crisis so

1151
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,249
for example in the one a christ thing we

1152
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,759
started working according to this

1153
00:48:40,759 --> 00:48:43,470
structure and that's taken away a lot of

1154
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:45,450
stress simply because we know each and

1155
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:48,359
everyone's got their role my role means

1156
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:49,680
that I've got a particular role in the

1157
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,480
crisis structure which means that I know

1158
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,180
I know my seat at which table I need to

1159
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,799
take and I need to know I know I know

1160
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:57,869
which actions I need to do and that goes

1161
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:59,640
for the rest of the team as well so in

1162
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,680
preparing for this type of stuff it

1163
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,509
really helps to have your stuff

1164
00:49:03,509 --> 00:49:12,390
documented we're not there yet so some

1165
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:17,700
of the next steps I think and that's

1166
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:21,809
that's also request to you please let's

1167
00:49:21,809 --> 00:49:24,269
see what we need to do to better reach

1168
00:49:24,269 --> 00:49:28,140
our constituency and also please let's

1169
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,299
have a look at how we can change the

1170
00:49:30,299 --> 00:49:31,650
stuff we do for example our what's your

1171
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:32,910
morning service which really looks

1172
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:35,940
outside we we track I don't know how

1173
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,710
many sources and we send out I don't

1174
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:40,890
know how many advisories where we're

1175
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:43,410
looking for a different way of

1176
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,630
approaching that same goes for finding

1177
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:47,339
skilled personnel how do we go about

1178
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:48,660
doing that

1179
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,430
and we don't know yet but we're

1180
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:52,920
currently in the process of starting a

1181
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,280
project to get more people inside be it

1182
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,099
because the approach might be that we

1183
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:01,260
need to have a different approach in in

1184
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,210
training them we might have to have a

1185
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:06,720
look at our universities to get the

1186
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,700
people that are fresh from university

1187
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,500
into our office and then what about the

1188
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:14,220
training path and also reach out to

1189
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,500
other partners in in this community that

1190
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:22,530
have the same challenges as we have this

1191
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:24,299
was the team of runners you won't

1192
00:50:24,299 --> 00:50:26,339
believe it but they they were actually

1193
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:28,470
had been running for about I don't know

1194
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:31,289
44 45 hours and they were still quite

1195
00:50:31,289 --> 00:50:33,240
fresh and very very relieved to be in

1196
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,400
Rotterdam after a grueling 48 hours or

1197
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,190
43 hours of only running and becoming

1198
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:42,059
very tight the the killer really is at

1199
00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:44,220
the end of the run in Rotterdam you've

1200
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,690
got to Daniel the hood clinic which is a

1201
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:49,230
cancer hospital where the cure cancer

1202
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:50,730
patient or they treat cancer patients

1203
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:53,309
and these patients are outside in their

1204
00:50:53,309 --> 00:50:55,020
beds and and with all the stuff make it

1205
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,369
very clear that there are patients and

1206
00:50:56,369 --> 00:50:59,250
after 48 hours of running not sleeping

1207
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:01,440
not having enough food your mental

1208
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,819
stability is gone it's it's definitely

1209
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:06,630
so it's a tear fest running you know

1210
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:14,150
running bite by that by that Hospital

1211
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:18,240
anyway this was our team this is the

1212
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,010
main main message so I hope you

1213
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,839
recognize the stuff I've just been

1214
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:25,200
talking about and this is the team that

1215
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,970
have been working on the initiatives

1216
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:30,000
we've been doing as you can see a very

1217
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,109
wide variety of teams of organizations

1218
00:51:33,109 --> 00:51:35,819
not national not all national not all

1219
00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:38,970
governmental not all sectoral you know

1220
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:43,079
it's it's a mesh of of various across

1221
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:45,779
the board across the the community

1222
00:51:45,779 --> 00:51:47,640
obviously there's the the first that's

1223
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:51,470
got a very important role in in

1224
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:54,799
facilitating the people from from first

1225
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:57,779
they've been very active in pulling this

1226
00:51:57,779 --> 00:52:00,869
forward and basically all the stuff we

1227
00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:02,099
think is very important in

1228
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:04,470
helping the cset maturity and making

1229
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:06,269
sure people realize it's not about the

1230
00:52:06,269 --> 00:52:08,359
technology it's about the processes etc

1231
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:12,089
these people have been helping have been

1232
00:52:12,089 --> 00:52:13,680
doing the work basically so thank you

1233
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,669
very much to those people

1234
00:52:18,049 --> 00:52:22,019
now last slide but one I think an open

1235
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:24,420
invitation if you want to have more

1236
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,309
discussion on this topic please reach

1237
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,349
out to me or to any of the people in the

1238
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:32,729
in the in the slide just now or and/or

1239
00:52:32,729 --> 00:52:35,430
visit the next talk in the I believe

1240
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:37,109
management tract there in the auditorium

1241
00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:39,660
it's more on C sub maturity how do you

1242
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,309
reach C sub maturity how do you go how

1243
00:52:41,309 --> 00:52:43,859
do you approach going towards his

1244
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:46,710
maturity and and also maybe even

1245
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:49,680
certification that will really help I

1246
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,380
think what we need to do is start up and

1247
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,089
continue the discussion on this and we

1248
00:52:54,089 --> 00:52:58,589
need fresh insights I'm not sure is

1249
00:52:58,589 --> 00:53:00,420
there any time for questions one

1250
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:06,589
question any questions

1251
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:14,130
you don't let me down Kalka thank you I

1252
00:53:14,309 --> 00:53:18,609
actually challenge you to inventor yet

1253
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:22,210
another layer of maturity and that is

1254
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:26,349
the maturity of certain cert cooperation

1255
00:53:26,349 --> 00:53:31,740
nice how we alert each other how we

1256
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:36,220
handle incidents together how we analyze

1257
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:41,140
malware together how we deal more

1258
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:45,460
complex cases together we are we have

1259
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:49,750
defined maturity scale for internal

1260
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:52,300
processes may be something on they are

1261
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,960
we produce output but not really under

1262
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:00,130
how we cooperate and really on the

1263
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:03,040
global scale we actually had a very good

1264
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,369
exercise a global scale cooperation just

1265
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:08,890
a couple of weeks ago and I think we

1266
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:14,140
didn't score a perfect 10 on that so I

1267
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,329
think we have some work to do in

1268
00:54:16,329 --> 00:54:18,099
addition to what you have already done

1269
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:20,290
with which I would like to thank you for

1270
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,720
work for your for your efforts just a

1271
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,660
comment yeah I definitely agree that's

1272
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:28,420
that's one of the steps that we haven't

1273
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,880
really done yet there are some some

1274
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,210
steps going towards that issue or at

1275
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:37,809
least in the European perspective but

1276
00:54:37,809 --> 00:54:39,900
it's definitely something we need to

1277
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,420
give more attention to and if I if I can

1278
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:45,369
bother you for some questions after this

1279
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:48,849
and in the period of time after this

1280
00:54:48,849 --> 00:54:50,530
that would be really good because I

1281
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:52,000
think that that's still one of the

1282
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,790
issues that we need to tackle all right

1283
00:54:57,790 --> 00:55:00,609
this is basically for clarification you

1284
00:55:00,609 --> 00:55:03,750
spoke about two incidents in your region

1285
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:08,170
that where your your team was really

1286
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,990
critical can you go back and talk a

1287
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:12,640
little bit more in detail about them

1288
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,180
there was one in 2011 yes another one

1289
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:22,510
yes yeah yeah we noticed there is that

1290
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:26,320
we were prepared we've been working as a

1291
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,150
team for quite number of years but we

1292
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:30,730
realized that we didn't really we

1293
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:32,650
weren't prepared for a national scale

1294
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:35,770
incident what happened can you give it a

1295
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:36,940
little bit of background of course yes

1296
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:40,870
sorry yeah what happened was the one of

1297
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:44,830
the national PKI root certificates or

1298
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:47,590
root certificate providers was actually

1299
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:54,190
compromised so the the certificate of

1300
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:56,260
the state of the Netherlands so they're

1301
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:59,350
you know the the the government

1302
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:01,450
certificate was compromised so there was

1303
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:02,890
no way of being able to trust

1304
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:06,010
communications between our IRS or other

1305
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:08,650
government services in the browser okay

1306
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:10,840
and at first we thought well you know we

1307
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,550
can manage without so over to the IRS

1308
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:14,200
for a couple of days that's fine we'll

1309
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,810
just request different certificates and

1310
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:19,120
then what we found is that well

1311
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,300
certificates are not only used in

1312
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,990
browsers they're also used in

1313
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,450
machine-to-machine communications and

1314
00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:26,920
what happened was Microsoft that

1315
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,730
prepared a patch to Reverb the trust of

1316
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:32,650
this particular certificate and we

1317
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:33,910
thought if they're going to revoke this

1318
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:35,470
if this patch is going to be going to be

1319
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:37,810
installed there is no communication

1320
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:41,860
possible anymore okay so that is why we

1321
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:45,340
asked Microsoft to please 4nl stop that

1322
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,930
patch so that we will have some more

1323
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:48,610
time to you know get get different

1324
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:51,490
certificates in investigate where these

1325
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:52,810
difficult are actually in stored they

1326
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:55,090
installed and make sure to renew them

1327
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:57,670
Wow and what were the lessons that your

1328
00:56:57,670 --> 00:57:00,700
team learned from that incident that we

1329
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:05,740
were not to learn about the crisis

1330
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:07,570
management we needed to learn to send

1331
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:09,760
home people so our processes were there

1332
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,190
for actual contents but not for the

1333
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:14,260
stuff around it so you know the food we

1334
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:16,120
only later discovered that you can't

1335
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:19,180
survive on sweets you need solid food if

1336
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:21,520
you have an incident that takes a week

1337
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,860
or two weeks to to run now also you need

1338
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,330
sent people home you know you need to

1339
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:27,190
have a schedule you can't be here for

1340
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:28,750
three days in a row you need 12 hours

1341
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:30,520
shifts and then if you have had that

1342
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,530
shift go home make sure that someone

1343
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:34,390
else takes your role so that's the sort

1344
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:36,670
of stuff the

1345
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:38,320
the process stuff is what we learned

1346
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,640
okay yeah

1347
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,370
