00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,040
now I am welcome Jeff carpenter as a

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,049
program committee chair to introduce our

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:09,470
first keynote speaker thank you

00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:17,750
[Applause]

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,080
I'm sure it also so I got a microphone

6
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,380
it's really great to see so many people

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,529
here

8
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,460
thank you all for for coming we really

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,480
hope you enjoy and learn a lot this week

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,940
so this past 30 years has been a journey

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,960
for our community we as a community have

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,800
learned and grown and matured by working

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,210
together and learning from each other

14
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,159
but we have also had a number of

15
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:55,080
collaborators along the way in other

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,839
communities that have worked with us and

17
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:03,330
supported us and all of us together have

18
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,409
helped improve the state of

19
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,070
cybersecurity our first keynote speaker

20
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,110
today has been one of those

21
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,060
collaborators who has worked with our

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,040
community Chris painter has been in the

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,530
Department of Justice and the FBI and

24
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,530
the White House most recently is the

25
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,950
chief diplomat for cybersecurity in the

26
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,929
State Department and through all of

27
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:31,170
those positions that he's held he's

28
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,060
worked very closely with the c-cert

29
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,880
community he was one of the the first to

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,960
recognize the value of the CCR community

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,869
and the the role that C certs and

32
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,420
National Seashore to play in cyber

33
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,030
security and how key that is in working

34
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,259
with policymakers law enforcement and

35
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:54,929
and diplomats both domestically within a

36
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:58,020
country and also internationally so it

37
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,990
gives me great pleasure to introduce my

38
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,210
friend and collaborator of many years

39
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,930
Chris painter

40
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:11,500
[Applause]

41
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,220
can people still say me there's a step

42
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,690
there's a secret step here but you know

43
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,650
[Laughter]

44
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,170
well thank you it's a great pleasure

45
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,330
being here with you today as Jeff said

46
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,190
I've known Jeff for many many years I've

47
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,410
certainly known this community for many

48
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,480
years and one of the things as Jeff said

49
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,430
I used to be at the Department of

50
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,650
Justice I was a prosecutor doing

51
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,890
cybercrime cases but also was involved

52
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,810
in a lot of policy efforts when I moved

53
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,940
from Los Angeles back to the mothership

54
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,620
and justice in DC and I remember in 2003

55
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,350
I was chairing something called the

56
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,870
hi-tech the g8 this is when there was a

57
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,420
g8 maybe there'll be a g8 again the g8 a

58
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,260
high-tech crime group subgroup and that

59
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,150
group did a lot of work around networks

60
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,940
of law enforcement etc to speed cyber

61
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,459
prosecutions but one interesting thing

62
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:14,660
about that was that was that we noticed

63
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,220
pretty early on that there needed to be

64
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,019
better collaboration between the law

65
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:19,220
enforcement community in the Sur

66
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,690
community and there was a lot of

67
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,280
distrust between these two communities

68
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,290
the law enforcement community didn't

69
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,459
really understand the search committee

70
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:26,450
they didn't understand what these

71
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,850
technical people were doing and the

72
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,320
technical community looked at the law

73
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,519
enforcement community with a lot of

74
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,500
distrust to thinking you know these guys

75
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,060
are the law enforcement officers they're

76
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,380
gonna lock us up if we give them

77
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,670
information they're not gonna know how

78
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,109
to use it there wasn't a lot of

79
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:40,850
understanding and how information got

80
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:44,450
shared so through first and through the

81
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,970
g8 group we brought law enforcement

82
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,070
together with the search community and I

83
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,480
remember we had a big meeting in the

84
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,040
Baltimore

85
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,250
meeting in 2006 I think that was we had

86
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,260
did preparatory work before that where

87
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,609
we had the surf community and the law

88
00:03:58,609 --> 00:03:59,989
enforcement unity to get together and it

89
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,820
was very interesting you know the law

90
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,440
enforcement community was all dressed in

91
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,620
suits you know and it you know now that

92
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,810
I left the the tepid embrace of the

93
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,880
federal government I can now wear no tie

94
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,250
but and normally I wear a tie - so you'd

95
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,630
had the law enforcement getting on these

96
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,600
suits looking very serious and you know

97
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,010
the search community showing up you know

98
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:19,790
dressed pretty

99
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,610
casually pretty low-key and we had this

100
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,560
session that lasted almost a full day

101
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,600
and it was really interesting because

102
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,670
after that session you know it took a

103
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,140
while to break down those barriers to

104
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,450
get those two sides talking together but

105
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,800
that really continued throughout the

106
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,390
first relationship to get the law

107
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,950
enforcement and first community the

108
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,060
technical community in the law

109
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,070
enforcement community talking and indeed

110
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,260
as I'll talk about later on we also need

111
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,820
that same bond between the policy

112
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,100
committee and the technical community

113
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,520
but I thought that was a really useful

114
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,830
useful thing and indeed you know on the

115
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,150
the first side I remember one of the

116
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,550
people Jeff was involved Yuri Ito who

117
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,580
was then at ap cert and JP cert from the

118
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,500
first community was leading it on part

119
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,680
from that side and unfortunately I don't

120
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,800
think he's here but Cato from Finland

121
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,690
who many of you know well took that

122
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,490
first meeting very seriously and would

123
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,250
call me or email me literally every week

124
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,960
with a new lead that he had that he

125
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,700
wanted to pass on the law enforcement so

126
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,310
so he really hit the ground running on

127
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,680
that but that that was really I think a

128
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,700
very interesting beginning and it really

129
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,380
showed the value of the technical

130
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,900
community collaborating with the the law

131
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,980
enforcement community a really

132
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,640
meaningful way now as that pretends I

133
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,130
was a prosecutor as I said so I am a

134
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,280
recovering lawyer and you know normally

135
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,950
in settings like this especially when

136
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,780
you're the first morning speaker you

137
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,220
would tell a lawyer joke to kind of

138
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,620
break the ice now the only problem I've

139
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,570
seen with that is through my years of

140
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,670
experience the problem in lawyer jokes

141
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,040
is that lawyers don't think they're

142
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,140
funny and non-lawyers don't think

143
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,080
they're jokes so so I won't tell a

144
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,250
lawyer joke I'll tell different I'll

145
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,620
tell the hacker joke later on I don't

146
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,000
know any diplomat jokes I'm now a

147
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,620
recovering diplomat but I don't know any

148
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,880
jokes there so today I wanted to talk

149
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,880
about a number of things I wanted to

150
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,280
talk about some of the growing threats

151
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,600
were seeing and all of you have seen

152
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,890
this too and I want to talk to you from

153
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,380
my perspective about that I want to talk

154
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,450
to you about the role of diplomacy my

155
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,280
last gig in the federal government and

156
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,410
dealing with these issues and how that

157
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,310
policies worked out internationally

158
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,960
but I want someone to emphasize

159
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,030
something that Jeff and I were talking

160
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,280
about yesterday which is that you know

161
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,930
obviously there are huge threats in the

162
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,240
world and obviously those threats seem

163
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,340
to be multiplying and growing both the

164
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,990
technical threats and the policy threats

165
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,380
but at the same time I think we'd be

166
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,570
remiss to not recognize all the progress

167
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,070
that's been made over the last thirty

168
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,740
years all the changes have been made

169
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,360
organizationally but also are our

170
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,190
success in combating a lot of those

171
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,990
threats and I think that's really due to

172
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,580
people in this room and other

173
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,080
communities who really stepped up their

174
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,340
game that doesn't mean we don't have to

175
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,590
do it more but as I go through this I

176
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,540
want to present not just the glass

177
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,790
half-empty view as prosecutors or want

178
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,450
to do but also a glass a glass half-full

179
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,910
view that we have done a lot there's a

180
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,970
lot of potential going forward you also

181
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,740
find out what this a bunch of zombies

182
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,410
have to do with this a bunch of

183
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,570
old-timey diplomats in this fact fact

184
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,770
this is how we dressed in my office

185
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:34,410
usually with and and and also why I am

186
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,520
so obsessed with this if for those of

187
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,550
you who know me well and who visited me

188
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,140
in my old office and in the State

189
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,290
Department I had my office was festoon

190
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,280
with pictures posters movie posters of

191
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,170
computer a movies were either the

192
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,420
computer was a main character or hackers

193
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,740
with main characters and I've carried

194
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,780
that forward after I've left the

195
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,490
government I post on my Twitter feed

196
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,550
every week the cyber movie poster of the

197
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,580
week and I had about 30 of them on the

198
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,740
walls of my office and they were you

199
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,080
know they included the matrix the net

200
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,430
the computer who wore tennis shoes

201
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,780
terminator many and almost every

202
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,180
computer movie you can think of and most

203
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,100
of those movies were not necessarily

204
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,080
great movies some were good some were

205
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,820
bad sneakers I think was good others

206
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,700
were pretty bad most of them were

207
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,120
dystopian movies but my favorite was

208
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,260
this movie and I'm going to talk about

209
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,940
this more in a second of why this is my

210
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,700
favorite but because this is the 30th

211
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,610
anniversary at first I wanted to use

212
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,309
another one for this this is

213
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,979
the first as far as I can tell movie

214
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,470
where a computer was a main character

215
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,680
it's 1957 its Spencer Tracy and

216
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,240
Katharine Hepburn it's a legitimately

217
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,180
good movie and it's a movie where so

218
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,730
about twice the age of first it's a

219
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,749
movie where Spencer Tracy plays a

220
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:02,220
computer inventor network engineer and

221
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,249
he he has invented an electronic brain

222
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:06,540
as they call him the movie called

223
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,449
Emmerich the electromagnetic memory and

224
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:14,069
research arithmetic calculator and he's

225
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:15,839
brought into this company to try to

226
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,970
streamline its operations and the head

227
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,829
of the research a research librarian is

228
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:21,899
Katherine Hepburn and she is doing all

229
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,490
the research manually figuring out

230
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,680
things and she and the rest of her staff

231
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,360
are worried about being replaced by this

232
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,949
computer and and so this this plays out

233
00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:34,889
the computer of course malfunctions and

234
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:38,009
it fires Katharine Hepburn but it also

235
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:40,529
fires everyone in the company including

236
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:42,149
the CEO it sends out prints out pink

237
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,279
slips to all of them and so you know

238
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,559
computer malfunctions were were common

239
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:49,230
even back then and so so at the end of

240
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,139
the movie Katherine Hepburn and Spencer

241
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:54,240
Tracy of course fall in love and

242
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,709
Katharine Hepburn gives him an ultimatum

243
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:58,319
and says it's either me or your computer

244
00:09:58,319 --> 00:10:00,750
and she starts to set the self-destruct

245
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,279
mechanism because everyone knows every

246
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,879
computer has a self-destruct mechanism

247
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:09,629
to to destroy the computer and and of

248
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:11,339
course Spencer Tracy tries and tries but

249
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:12,509
he can't help himself he saves his

250
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:14,009
computer but she still takes him anyway

251
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:16,620
so a happy ending so that that is in

252
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,829
honor of first the first computer movie

253
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:22,620
to my knowledge but my favorite again is

254
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,439
this one and this movie was really the

255
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:27,660
first computer movie where computers

256
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,429
took over the world so long before

257
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:33,269
wargames or or before Terminator this

258
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:36,269
was 1970 the u.s. builds Colossus to

259
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,800
control its nuclear arsenal and have

260
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,269
perfect deterrents take the man in the

261
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:41,220
middle the soviets because it was the

262
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,309
Soviets back then built Guardian in the

263
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:45,870
Urals they stole the information from

264
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,749
the u.s. they they then built a Guardian

265
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:52,139
a pure computer and the urals the two

266
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:54,350
computers started talking to each other

267
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,510
come self-aware and to protect humankind

268
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,130
from itself they take away all civil

269
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,410
liberties and take all over the world so

270
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,420
I recommend this highly if you haven't

271
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,100
seen it it's also a favorite of many in

272
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,050
the computer industry it's an eclectic

273
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,880
movie you can you can I don't think you

274
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,230
can stream it anywhere but you can get

275
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,790
the discs in some places and I recommend

276
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,360
an island now you know so that I watched

277
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,520
that movie when I was in grade school I

278
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,620
sat through the theater twice I saw the

279
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,370
movie two times in a row which tells you

280
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,750
a little bit about my personality I

281
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,420
guess but but it really fascinated me

282
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,030
and you know you know and my first

283
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,290
computer back then was an Atari 800

284
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,090
which many of you may remember they had

285
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,430
a cassette tape drive so I had you know

286
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,070
very early on computer I was really into

287
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:44,000
this and of course now we have you know

288
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,460
we all have very powerful computers as

289
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,650
everyone knows on their desktop at our

290
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,750
workplace in our pockets with cellular

291
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,940
phones and it's really permeated every

292
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,650
aspect of our lives and all of the folks

293
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,600
here know this well and and while the

294
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,350
Internet has been a tremendous force for

295
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,090
for commerce and social interaction and

296
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,430
for good and for connecting people

297
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,980
around the world it's also been a target

298
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,450
for criminals and malicious

299
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,210
nation-states and terrorists and while

300
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,220
it's allowed people to organize and and

301
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,710
come together it's also allowed more

302
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,930
repressive regimes to monitor dissidents

303
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,760
and undermine democratic processes so

304
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,250
just like anything else the technology

305
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,840
is not necessarily good or bad on its

306
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,150
own but it's used in both ways and we've

307
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,850
seen that around the world and because

308
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,670
of the global nature of computer

309
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,710
networks these issues almost always take

310
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,810
on an international dimension that was

311
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,190
true when I was a prosecutor that was

312
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,360
true certainly when I was in the State

313
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,550
Department so it's been necessary for us

314
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,050
to work and and and and the first

315
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,710
organization is a good example of this

316
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,060
for us to work both nationally and

317
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,920
globally both to preserve and expand the

318
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,330
benefits of computer networks but also

319
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,310
to combat their threats and and again

320
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,620
first has played a major role here and

321
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,470
you know I been doing this now I start

322
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,140
as a prosecutor in 1990 so I've been

323
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,020
doing things related to computers for

324
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,110
about 28 years for a long time not quite

325
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,160
as long as first

326
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,670
but for for quite a long time and you

327
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,259
know I've been lucky because I was a

328
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,930
federal prosecutor in Los Angeles in the

329
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,279
90s during some of the early computer

330
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:19,490
crime cases and I'll talk a little bit

331
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,350
about those in a second I went to the

332
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,970
mothership at justice and helped run the

333
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,620
computer crime intellectual property

334
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,649
section I went from there to the FBI for

335
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:28,850
a brief time and their cyber division

336
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,310
helping run that I went to the White

337
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,389
House in the beginning of the Obama

338
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:35,269
administration to help set up the Cyber

339
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:36,800
Directorate and the National Security

340
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,899
Council and from there I went to the

341
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:41,269
State Department and and that time has

342
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:43,220
given me a perspective on terms of the

343
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,870
evolution of the threat but also some of

344
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,920
the things we've done that I'd like to

345
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,269
hit on today so you know but it also

346
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:52,009
gives me a good sense of how as I said

347
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:53,480
in the beginning how far we've come how

348
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,519
how much progress we've made even though

349
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,209
the challenges still remain in the other

350
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:01,459
thing I think it's been fascinating is

351
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:03,019
just seeing the beginning of a whole new

352
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:04,699
field in this area which is a cyber

353
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:07,100
diplomacy field which I helped start at

354
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,269
the State Department which I want to

355
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:11,269
talk to and why that's important as an

356
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:12,949
aspect just as important as what first

357
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:14,329
and other organizations do and really

358
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:16,759
helping to build a more secure cyber

359
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,100
environment for all of us so let me talk

360
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,550
about the threat first a little bit you

361
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,199
know obviously all of you guys in this

362
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:25,670
room know the threat better than anyone

363
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,740
you know even for the people who are

364
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,350
laymen you see the front page of the

365
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,380
papers every day new stories new threats

366
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,500
new issues and the range of threat

367
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,319
actors range from everything from the

368
00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:41,269
lone gunman hackers as I used to call

369
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:43,459
them the individuals to transnational

370
00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:47,050
organized crime to terrorists although

371
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,130
terrorists have continued to use the

372
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,839
internet more to communicate and to

373
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:52,519
proselytize and to raise money and not

374
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:53,930
really do attack infrastructure we've

375
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,399
been worried about that for about 30

376
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,600
years but it hasn't happened yet but

377
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,449
could still happen and nation-states you

378
00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:01,970
know in terms of those who were seen as

379
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,740
a threat to the US our Director of

380
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,509
National Intelligence have said that the

381
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:08,660
main nation states are Russia China and

382
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,930
North Korea and Iran but also are

383
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,579
worried about proxies nation-states

384
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,470
using proxies in addition to

385
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,360
transnational organized criminal groups

386
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,149
and and indeed you know there have been

387
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:20,730
many

388
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,410
many big cases over the years I think

389
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,870
have highlighted the risks involved now

390
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,610
the problem I see is that we've had

391
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,709
these big cases and people really care

392
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:31,560
about them for about a day and then they

393
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,930
lose interest again and we still need to

394
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,149
build that awareness outside of the

395
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:37,350
communities to deal with this but

396
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,050
Equifax was obviously a big wake-up call

397
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,220
for many people because it actually

398
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,699
affected them some of the big ransomware

399
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,320
attacks which were not just ransomware

400
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,420
but in the case of not petia for

401
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,279
instance an attack on infrastructure so

402
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,230
we we had that we had the wanna cry

403
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,019
attack those were very serious in my

404
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,760
career as a prosecutor one of the first

405
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,209
cases that I worked on was the

406
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,310
prosecution of kevin Mitnick who was the

407
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:07,649
hacker who hit companies really around

408
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:09,720
the world for an extended period of time

409
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,850
for about two and a half year period of

410
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,360
time after he left custody when he was

411
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,680
on parole in in Los Angeles and he left

412
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,660
and went on the lam and then started

413
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,620
hitting companies around the world

414
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,970
stealing their source code and other

415
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,389
information that was in development you

416
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:28,709
know back then I think was a more

417
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:30,990
innocent time and people didn't really

418
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,610
weren't as dependent on the computer

419
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,350
network certainly companies were a lot

420
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,760
of the systems he was getting into her

421
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,620
company systems telecommunications

422
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,449
companies cellular companies software

423
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:42,360
companies but I think a lot of people

424
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,949
and you know who were just ordinary

425
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:46,470
people thought he was more like a Robin

426
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,910
Hood you know he was just they didn't

427
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,440
really understand why this was serious

428
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,639
because it wasn't affecting them

429
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,079
personally and I remember when we were

430
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,660
doing the sentencing for kevin Mitnick

431
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,639
he pled guilty a couple weeks before

432
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,079
trial we had pretty good evidence

433
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,120
against him including him on tape you

434
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,470
know trying to get and trying to get

435
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,880
software from some of the companies but

436
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,290
and a lot of the technical analysis that

437
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:10,829
we had done

438
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,510
there was a plane flying over the

439
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,309
courthouse with a free Kevin banner on

440
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:15,959
it so there was a lot of I think

441
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,329
thinking well how serious can this be

442
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,730
but in fact he caused and he agreed in

443
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,410
this plea agreement to have caused over

444
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,699
five million dollars of damage to

445
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,530
various companies so many companies that

446
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,720
we didn't list them all by name to

447
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,980
protect some of the company since it was

448
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,559
the plea agreement we had a company a a

449
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,960
through double Z I

450
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,640
so we had lots of different companies

451
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,279
around the world that were affected at

452
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:42,029
the same time you know back then it was

453
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:43,679
a serious event there were concerns

454
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,500
there were things that he did both you

455
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,299
know that were the things we charged

456
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:49,320
there were other things that were going

457
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,029
on and that was you know one of the

458
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,919
things that was at least rumored is he

459
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:56,850
would hack in the telephone system and

460
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,700
and give and make problems for some of

461
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,470
the people he didn't like like changing

462
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,480
their commercial or their residential

463
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,070
phone to a commercial phone so it asked

464
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,840
you to deposit 25 cents was one of the

465
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,659
stories about him but you know back then

466
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:10,950
I don't think people understood the full

467
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,380
seriousness of it but since then we've

468
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,750
had an accelerating list of different

469
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,940
things that have been high-profile

470
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,010
things on the Internet one of the cases

471
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,960
I also worked on in Los Angeles was one

472
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,970
of the two first stock manipulation

473
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,159
cases on the internet and one was a

474
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:28,500
company named para game in Los Angeles

475
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,720
where someone created a fake Bloomberg

476
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,390
page that said that the company is being

477
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,029
bought by an Israeli company and because

478
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:37,830
time is money in the stock market people

479
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,600
started buying up Peregrine stock it

480
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,520
went up 30% in the space of about an

481
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,559
hour and a half on NASDAQ now the

482
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:46,649
Israeli company it was a holiday in

483
00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:48,179
Israel so nobody could actually confirm

484
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,460
the Israeli company and because of the

485
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,990
time difference in California where the

486
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,360
company was located it was three hours

487
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,159
behind the NASDAQ exchange so people

488
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:57,600
didn't understand they couldn't get

489
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,669
answers from there and this person very

490
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:01,440
cleverly created this fake Bloomberg

491
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,080
page which was being very good it was

492
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,750
hosted on a web hosting service but if

493
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,490
you hit any of the links the hot links

494
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,570
on the side of it taking the real

495
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:13,470
Bloomberg page and then you know what

496
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,029
they did is they started using chat

497
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,010
rooms Raging Bull and others to start

498
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,590
generating some some excitement about

499
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,669
this saying you know this company's

500
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:22,470
being bought this is a big deal they're

501
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,840
being bought by for two billion dollars

502
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,510
this is great and and people were very

503
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,159
sophisticated like including James

504
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:31,980
Cramer who still has a show talking

505
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,440
about investments invested in this and

506
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,149
lost money because it turned out it was

507
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:38,760
all false and we were able to trace it

508
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,559
down very quickly because even though

509
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,950
they use this web hosting service we

510
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,809
were able to trace it down because the

511
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,250
web hosting service something called

512
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,510
angel

513
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,340
did you know allowed you to create your

514
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,530
own page but you set up your account you

515
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,340
didn't really have to give much

516
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,600
information you just had to give a

517
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,850
hotmail account and the hotmail account

518
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:02,610
was Joe anywhere now from anywhere USA

519
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,830
and using years of investigative

520
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,850
knowledge from doing a lot of these

521
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,640
cases I realized that was probably false

522
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,090
so and my FBI agent realized that and we

523
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:12,990
were but we were able to trace it

524
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,919
because Angelfire kept logs of where the

525
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,190
account was set up from the IP addresses

526
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,679
those logs then went back to earth link

527
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,429
earth link kept radius long the radius

528
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:28,440
logs tracked back to these were you know

529
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,480
wasn't a cable modem but was a dial-up

530
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,490
modem so we had the actual location and

531
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,169
we were able to do a search and we were

532
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:37,200
able to find the person who when we

533
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,929
found him said he just wanted to create

534
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:41,370
some good publicity for his company

535
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,539
because it always was getting negative

536
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,130
publicity and that's all he really cared

537
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,049
about he actually didn't trade he meant

538
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:47,960
to trade but he got cold feet so

539
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,030
involved in those cases there was

540
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,640
another case back in the Millennium

541
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,770
around 2000 where it was one of the

542
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,169
first big denial of service cases and

543
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:00,270
this was a case where there was a

544
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,159
widespread denial of service attack on

545
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,690
ebay etrade CNN many other services

546
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,870
around the u.s. and it turned out that

547
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,690
it was a 14 year old who went by the

548
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:17,159
moniker mafia boy in Canada and we were

549
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:19,350
able to work with the RCMP our

550
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,350
counterparts there and and trace that

551
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,929
threat down and it turned out that we

552
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:27,270
put a wiretap on the house in Canada

553
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,240
which the RCMP did and we picked up on

554
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,850
the wiretap that the father of mafia boy

555
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:36,690
who I'll call mafia dad had ordered a

556
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,950
hit on one of his colleagues

557
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,590
now that was you know we cared about the

558
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,030
computer case we decided to take the

559
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,380
case down because that was a more

560
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,510
important thing and we found out that

561
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,010
the kid who did this was a juvenile was

562
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,679
14 they prosecuted in Canada as a

563
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,840
juvenile but it just showed the kind of

564
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,909
asymmetric threat and again you know

565
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:55,230
people were beginning to worry about

566
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,130
that and then much later when I was at

567
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,170
the justice everyone I was said this the

568
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,330
State Department in the White House we

569
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,500
had the Sony attack by North Korea and

570
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,630
and how we dealt with that because that

571
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,520
was a nation state attack and how you

572
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,140
actually deal with some of those issues

573
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,690
which is very interesting because part

574
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,760
of the issues were attribution part of

575
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,870
the issues is what you do to

576
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,250
determination State and I'll talk to

577
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,610
more about that later and that posed a

578
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,200
lot of interesting challenges because

579
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,210
it's a private company but the attacker

580
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,630
was a nation-state and then we had the

581
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,310
issue of wholesale theft of intellectual

582
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:36,360
property and trade secrets that one of

583
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,550
our government officials called the

584
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,260
greatest transfer of wealth in the

585
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,180
history of mankind I'm not sure I think

586
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,290
that's a little exaggerated but

587
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:46,200
certainly a lot of theft of trade

588
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,730
secrets and business proprietary

589
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:51,030
information that you know we were

590
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:53,100
attributing to China and I'll talk a

591
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,290
little bit about how we resolved or at

592
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,640
least got to a better place on that

593
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,540
later on - we had the fear of

594
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,240
debilitating infrastructure attacks

595
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,860
Estonia in 2007 really wasn't that but

596
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,240
it was think the wake up call for that

597
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,490
some of the some of the events in the

598
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,960
Ukraine I think we're very concerning

599
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,870
about that and you know we had the fear

600
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,940
of the intent of screwing around with

601
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,860
the integrity of the information as my

602
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,320
friend Thomas silvus the former

603
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,710
president of Estonia used to say you

604
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,360
know I worry if I can't get on my

605
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,590
computer for a couple hours because of

606
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,120
the denial service attack I worry more

607
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,590
if someone changes my blood type and

608
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,200
next time I get a transfusion I die so

609
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,870
we're worried about that as well

610
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,700
Internet of Things creates new

611
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,260
challenges and we've seen some of the

612
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,140
attacks around that I haven't Internet

613
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,820
of Things joke so this is in development

614
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,900
so you can tell me what you think of

615
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,630
this I said this in the panel one time

616
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,980
and this is true there was one story

617
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,380
when a number a group of connected

618
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,680
refrigerators were lashed together to

619
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,020
attack financial institution websites

620
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,110
and I thought that was a great new

621
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,380
example of freezing your assets it needs

622
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,990
a little work and then we have

623
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,270
unforeseen threats that we at the cyber

624
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,880
community in the US as much as we've

625
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,530
been working on this as much as we were

626
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,030
working with our technical colleagues we

627
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,620
just didn't see coming the Russian

628
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,380
interference

629
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,870
our democratic processes both in the US

630
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,390
and other places around the world we

631
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,800
didn't see that coming that wasn't on

632
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,330
our top threat list when we were looking

633
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,710
at this because it's more of a hybrid

634
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,870
threat it's cyber-enabled but it's also

635
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,610
a traditional influence operation I

636
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:28,660
think we have to be better at dealing

637
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,010
with those hybrid threats

638
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,070
there are also policy threats different

639
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,950
futures of visions of the futures of

640
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,320
technology and you know there are some

641
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,600
countries that view information in many

642
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,850
ways as a threat to their stability and

643
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,160
you know the Russians tend to use the

644
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,810
term information security because they

645
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,190
care about the threat of information

646
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,560
versus cybersecurity that we use and

647
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,270
there are countries that want to promote

648
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,070
absolute sovereignty drawing a line

649
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:59,830
around their borders when I often travel

650
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,420
to Beijing and had meetings with the

651
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,280
government in China a number of

652
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,300
different issues and I think it's

653
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,770
important we do have those kind of

654
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,110
meetings but this is something that was

655
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:11,320
in my hotel room at the Hyatt and if you

656
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,330
see they're very nice nicely done

657
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,540
logos for Facebook Instagram Twitter

658
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,310
YouTube Google the New York Times and

659
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,350
Bloomberg at the very bottom it says are

660
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:31,920
not available in this hotel so you know

661
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,000
we also have countries so we're

662
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,040
increasingly using the Internet not just

663
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,960
as a tool for growth but also as a tool

664
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,780
to monitor their citizens and to curtail

665
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,310
speech which is concerning and there's

666
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,750
really a battle in the developing world

667
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,390
between stability and economic growth a

668
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,130
lot of the developing world sees a

669
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,930
benefit stability but they also want

670
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,640
economic growth and so how can we make

671
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,770
sure we have both and there are

672
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,270
multilateral bodies around the world

673
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,620
that want to control the internet they

674
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,750
want to have government control of the

675
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,130
internet rather than the system we have

676
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,980
now which is a multi-stakeholder one and

677
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,800
beyond that over a hundred countries in

678
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,110
the world are developing offensive cyber

679
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,540
capabilities it's become a new domain of

680
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,040
warfare and that that creates a lot of

681
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,700
challenges so I often say cyber now is a

682
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,920
new block that everyone like cares about

683
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,240
cyber they don't know what it is but

684
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,530
they all care about it and that's good

685
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,090
and I think we are actually making a lot

686
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,530
of progress in combating those threats

687
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,690
and there's been lots of progress both

688
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,710
domestically in the US and around the

689
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,539
but also internationally and in terms of

690
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:31,700
our cooperation first and with one key

691
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,850
observation I want to make is that you

692
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,289
know it's not perfect yet

693
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:38,539
but we're in a transition period they

694
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:40,490
think it's very important that it used

695
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,559
to be the cyber was just seen as this

696
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,289
technical issue this niche issue where

697
00:26:45,289 --> 00:26:47,179
if you went to a cabinet level or a

698
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:49,190
minister or you went to the CEO of a

699
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,929
company you talked about cyber and cyber

700
00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:53,390
security they would look at you like you

701
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,159
were kind of crazy they would say you

702
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:56,809
guys go and deal with the technical

703
00:26:56,809 --> 00:26:58,789
experts you talk to the CIA so if

704
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:00,230
there's even one of the company you talk

705
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,299
to the technical experts and and

706
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:04,399
government and they never really treated

707
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:06,679
it as a serious policy issue and I think

708
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:08,690
the change now is in increasingly

709
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,130
countries are treating it as a core

710
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,140
issue of national security policy of

711
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,510
economic policy of human rights policy

712
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,610
of foreign policy and that makes a big

713
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,440
difference if countries are beginning to

714
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,059
not think of this as this boutique issue

715
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:21,350
but a core issue of international

716
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,270
security policy that means they're gonna

717
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,799
start paying attention to it now as I

718
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,980
said it's not it's not complete yet and

719
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,240
there's a lot more work to be done but I

720
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,799
think that's a serious transition and I

721
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,029
think that's good for everyone in this

722
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:33,679
room because you were the people they

723
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,840
need to talk to as they treat this more

724
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,340
as a policy issue and they don't have to

725
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,350
be technical experts you don't need the

726
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,850
president of the country and there are a

727
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,350
few are like you know the former

728
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,090
Estonian president was and and some

729
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,760
others who are experts you just need to

730
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,590
be able to have reach back to the

731
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,059
experts and understand some of the core

732
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:52,399
policy issues we've seen governments

733
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,070
become far more organized my own

734
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,320
government we used to say we had silos

735
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,640
of excellence you know with all these

736
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,260
different parts of our government who

737
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,210
were great at doing their own thing but

738
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,500
never talked to the other parts of our

739
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,029
government and that's true around the

740
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:07,399
world and and one of the things we did

741
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:08,929
in my government when I went to the

742
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:11,120
White House is we had a cyberspace

743
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,860
policy review we looked at all of our

744
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,809
policies and we tried to bring those

745
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:16,309
different elements together and we had

746
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:17,870
many meetings about this we had people

747
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,059
getting together we had organizations

748
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:23,929
created like the National like our cyber

749
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:25,940
response group which brought all the

750
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,529
agencies together to look at major cyber

751
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:29,659
threats I had both the technical and

752
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:31,880
policy people and that was important we

753
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,590
did an international strategy for

754
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,360
cyberspace but now countries around the

755
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,919
world are doing that as well including

756
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:39,529
in China and the UK and others have

757
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:40,250
international store

758
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:43,370
geez now and we created I was created my

759
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,780
old office at the State Department is

760
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,280
the first office anywhere in the world

761
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,970
that did cyber diplomacy and and brought

762
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,770
all this basket of issues cross-cutting

763
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,660
everything from issues around human

764
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,700
rights to issues around governance to

765
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,080
issues around cybersecurity and cyber

766
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,630
crime to international security issues

767
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,910
and how do you prevent conflict and war

768
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:04,130
in cyberspace so all those issues were

769
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:07,910
housed in my office and and now there is

770
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,100
something like 27 other countries who

771
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,540
have offices like that around the world

772
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,160
and in almost every country is now

773
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,840
developing an office in their foreign

774
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,830
ministry that deals with these issues

775
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,380
and again that's important because it's

776
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,880
not just the technical element although

777
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,860
I had technical people in my office it

778
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,170
is also the policy element and elevating

779
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,860
it to this issue and as I said our scope

780
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,310
was cross-cutting now unfortunately my

781
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:36,350
office was was kind of disbanded and

782
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,150
when the shortly after the new

783
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,200
administration came in because

784
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,230
apparently this is not a problem anymore

785
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,670
but I'm pretty confident it'll be

786
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,990
recreated now because I think they

787
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,610
understand the seriousness of this but

788
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,230
27 other countries have not done this at

789
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,290
the growing number with a wide scope of

790
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,120
the different issues we deal with we

791
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,070
launched whole-of-government dialogues

792
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,210
with countries around the world

793
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,790
including Japan for instance was the

794
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,320
very first one we launched but we have

795
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:05,000
Japan Korea South Korea Brazil India we

796
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,430
had a dialogue with China we still have

797
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,750
a dialogue with China

798
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,880
we had dialogue with the Nordic Baltic

799
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,070
countries and others and we'd bring all

800
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,900
the different government players not

801
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,250
just the State Department not just the

802
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,600
Foreign Ministry people but our defense

803
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,150
people our DHS people our law

804
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,620
enforcement people our human rights

805
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,540
people and they would bring all the

806
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,740
people from their side and we bring our

807
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,030
technical people too so you would have

808
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,290
that interaction which is really

809
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:33,530
important and that also helped us

810
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,820
promote a number of things that we were

811
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,860
doing beyond that including operational

812
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,840
international cooperation in cybercrime

813
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,580
we've been working to promote the

814
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,290
Budapest convention for cybercrime which

815
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,150
I've worked on when I was at justice we

816
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,830
created in the g8 that's something

817
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,750
called the 24/7 Network which now has

818
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,780
over 60 countries which allows

819
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,010
quick-quick coordination on cybercrime

820
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,360
issues

821
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,280
and cybersecurity one of the key things

822
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,960
we did was with this community with a

823
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,260
search community and working really hard

824
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,790
to make sure that countries had national

825
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:05,240
strategies in place that included key

826
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,000
components like what what structures you

827
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,610
need to have including cybersecurity and

828
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,770
including having a national level see

829
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,510
sir and I think it's really interesting

830
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,940
to note that Jeff and I were talking

831
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,050
back in 2003 when there was a first C

832
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,300
cert meeting there were only 10 national

833
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:23,990
si certs

834
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,780
now there's something like 124 of them

835
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,880
and that's a great great statistic that

836
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,680
means more countries are doing this and

837
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,060
they're understanding the importance of

838
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,980
this at a national level now some of

839
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,110
them have limited resources and that's a

840
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,370
challenge but I think that's really

841
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:42,830
important we've been using you know

842
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,420
we've been promoting that that is should

843
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,920
we've also been using diplomatic tools

844
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,950
to combat operational threats remember

845
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,750
when I told you what zombies had to do

846
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,610
with diplomats when we had the big

847
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,620
denial of service attack that came from

848
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,480
Iran that went after our financial

849
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,590
institutions for about a year-long

850
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,870
period one of the things we did is we

851
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,640
consider all our options our technical

852
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,590
community talks these are botnets so

853
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,850
they're spread all over the world there

854
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,440
were concentrations in Germany and other

855
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,730
places but they're spread all over the

856
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,640
place like any bond that is so we looked

857
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,530
at our options and one of the options we

858
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,990
had was to do what's called a diplomatic

859
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,490
de Marsh now that just sounds like a

860
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:18,350
nasty thing but it can be a positive

861
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,720
thing it could be hey can you help me so

862
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,720
I we did it - Marsh - 24 different

863
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,220
countries around the world where these

864
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,740
botnets were concentrated where the bots

865
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,510
were concentrated and said can you use

866
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,310
whatever tools you have whatever laws

867
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,720
you have in your country to help us

868
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,670
mitigate this and that was very very

869
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,440
successful so was creating this network

870
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,540
both of the technical level that the

871
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,490
certs have already done but also on the

872
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,770
policy level and that's how the zombies

873
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,920
and diplomats actually work together and

874
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,300
and we were trying to build

875
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,010
international networks to deal with

876
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,420
these shared threats so we can call on

877
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,690
this time and time again in negotiation

878
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,580
is another area where I think we made

879
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,280
some real strides I mentioned the issue

880
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,800
with China that was a big sticking point

881
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,390
between the US and China for quite some

882
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:07,280
time and we after really years

883
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,630
two years of sustained diplomatic

884
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,790
efforts we were able to reach an

885
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,790
agreement with China that no country

886
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,380
should steal the intellectual property

887
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,730
using cyber means of the other to

888
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,800
benefit their commercial sector and that

889
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,360
became not just the agreement between

890
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,970
the US and China but an agreement that

891
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,610
was enshrined in the g20 Australia

892
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,380
recent agreement the UK we shouldn't

893
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,610
agreement and Germany reached an

894
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,410
agreement and that really helps because

895
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:33,730
that creates a norm an expectation a

896
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,870
level of accountability that I think

897
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,940
really was very helpful and then another

898
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,380
big effort that we engaged in is

899
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,940
capacity building and here again is

900
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,560
something where I think there's been a

901
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,320
tremendous amount of benefit and Menace

902
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,810
my work from the c-cert community you

903
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:50,750
know some of that has been doing the

904
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,400
training that the first community does

905
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,200
and doing the cert development the

906
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,570
training that the Sur community has

907
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,790
always been valuable and part of we

908
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:02,390
worked very hard in my office to - with

909
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,980
the software engineering Institute at

910
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,110
Carnegie Mellon to design a cert

911
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,670
training where we worked around the

912
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,620
world in doing that the Organization for

913
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,510
American States has a cert building

914
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,790
training in that region APEC and ASEAN

915
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,440
are looking at I've done some work in

916
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,520
this - which is the thing is really

917
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,310
important we've tried to include

918
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,840
technical training as part of our

919
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,639
overall training that we've done in

920
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,409
sub-saharan Africa that my group has

921
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:25,909
done there's something called the Global

922
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:27,590
Forum for cyber expertise that was

923
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,870
launched by the Dutch they had the

924
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,399
incident response meeting just here

925
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:34,340
yesterday with first members there's

926
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,199
some several working groups and this is

927
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,260
again a capacity-building effort I chair

928
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,668
something called the strategy and policy

929
00:34:40,668 --> 00:34:42,560
group which is looking at things like

930
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,389
national strategies and how we make sure

931
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:46,880
that we're helping countries and filling

932
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,590
the gaps around the world you know I

933
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,120
think the capacity building is one of

934
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,889
the most important things that us as a

935
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,139
joint community can do because more and

936
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,790
more countries really need to have the

937
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,260
ability to work on these things and I

938
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,290
think that's important so so I think

939
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,090
that's been a really important effort

940
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:06,230
over the years and then the other thing

941
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,600
I think that we have been doing so super

942
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,670
passive buildings important negotiations

943
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,350
of important dealing of threats is

944
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,610
important but we also have to look to

945
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,320
the future and as I said many many

946
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,240
countries are developing cyber weapons

947
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,640
and cyber capabilities so we need to try

948
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,930
to shape the international

949
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:23,540
to have better long term cyber stability

950
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:27,619
and that includes a framework for Cyprus

951
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:29,780
stability international law applies just

952
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,460
like it does in the physical world it

953
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,960
applies to cyberspace and not so

954
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,140
different that there should be certain

955
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,609
norms and behavior rules of the road

956
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:39,800
voluntary rules of the road and that

957
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,790
there should be what we call

958
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,079
confidence-building measures that

959
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,609
countries can talk to each other having

960
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:45,770
hot lines in place having doctrine

961
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,750
exchange you know the only real analog

962
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,839
to the nuclear world mostly government

963
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:52,250
has been involved in this but also this

964
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,809
global Commission for the stability of

965
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:55,359
cyberspace I'm now a commissioner on

966
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,730
it's been helping it evolve this there's

967
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:03,589
been work in a lot of different forums

968
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:05,210
so one of the things as I said we were

969
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,240
working on is norms not these norms

970
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,579
that's norm from Cheers Norman

971
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:13,309
Schwarzkopf and Norman Mailer in case

972
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:15,950
you didn't see them but these norms

973
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:18,920
which are peacetime norms what are the

974
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,050
norms of behavior below the threshold of

975
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,700
armed conflict people always talk about

976
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,380
cyber war I think they're there

977
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,540
overdoing it we haven't really seen much

978
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,000
in the way a real cyber war but we see a

979
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,799
lot of activity below that threshold so

980
00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:32,930
we working on why are things that states

981
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,520
should not do what are norms of

982
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,230
restraint or cooperation and the ones

983
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,630
laid out here that we're agreed to by

984
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,980
countries around the world including

985
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,770
China Russia the US the UK the rest of

986
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,630
the p5 but also many other countries and

987
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,400
increasingly countries are joining on to

988
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,589
this is a stageful not conductor knowing

989
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:50,690
the support cyber-enabled activity as i

990
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,400
mentioned on the theft of IP the

991
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,900
benefits our commercial sector that a

992
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,049
state should not conduct activity that

993
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,790
intentionally damages or otherwise

994
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,650
impairs critical infrastructure that

995
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,150
provides services the public that that

996
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,460
that is something below you know when

997
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,869
you're in wartime different rules might

998
00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:08,299
apply but when you're not in wartime you

999
00:37:08,299 --> 00:37:10,549
shouldn't do that a state should

1000
00:37:10,549 --> 00:37:13,520
cooperate consistent with its laws and

1001
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,380
international obligations when and when

1002
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,730
there's malicious code coming from that

1003
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,680
state and another state asset they

1004
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,660
should use either technical means or law

1005
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,130
enforcement means to help mitigate and

1006
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,200
then particularly for this community

1007
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,170
this one which was agreed to again in

1008
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,880
this international setting and one that

1009
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,680
we think is really important which is

1010
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,359
the state should not conductor knowingly

1011
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:34,070
support activity intended to

1012
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,020
prevent national computer security

1013
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,600
incident response teams from responding

1014
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,750
to cyber incidents so we view the the

1015
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:44,390
cert community as the hospitals as the

1016
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,730
ambulances and that states should not

1017
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:49,730
attack those certs and and that I think

1018
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,990
is a very important norm for this

1019
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,550
community and one I think this community

1020
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,560
can help institutionalize and spread

1021
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,610
around the world because it's very

1022
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:56,840
important there's the second part of

1023
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,990
that the state should not use Caesars to

1024
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,760
enable online activity that's intended

1025
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,260
to do harm so the search should be used

1026
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,580
for good basically and that's really

1027
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,620
important too and then this commission

1028
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,210
them a member of has gone beyond that

1029
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:11,210
and has proposed another norm that state

1030
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,310
states and non-state actors should not

1031
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,380
do any activity that would fundamentally

1032
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,650
make unavailable and damage the general

1033
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,630
availability and integrity of the core

1034
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,610
of the internet the domain-name systems

1035
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,200
the router is the key things to make the

1036
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,580
Internet's work and we're working on

1037
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:30,320
other norms as well there now that's

1038
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,030
important having rules of the road is

1039
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:34,100
important but you can have all the rules

1040
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,410
of the road in the world and if there's

1041
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,540
no enforcement if there's no

1042
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,130
consequences for people who violate

1043
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:43,400
those rules then they're really pieces

1044
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,720
of paper they're just written on pieces

1045
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,540
of paper so deterrence in cyberspace is

1046
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,160
I think something we'd all need to think

1047
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,260
about and and as part of our tool

1048
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,180
setting and making cyberspace more

1049
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,740
secure generally we need to think about

1050
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,400
what that means and and what that means

1051
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,170
to me is the pterence generally means

1052
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,030
you have a credible and timely response

1053
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,680
and if you think about all the attacks

1054
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,860
that we've seen over the years both the

1055
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,420
nation-state attacks and the other

1056
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,700
attacks our response hasn't been very

1057
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,410
timely and it hasn't been very credible

1058
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,640
and look there are reasons for that

1059
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,630
there's issues around attribution no I

1060
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,700
remember with respect to attribution

1061
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,320
when the North Korea attack on Sony

1062
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,120
Pictures happened everyone in the

1063
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,250
community said it was North Korea until

1064
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,260
President Obama came out and said it was

1065
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,490
North Korea then a lot of people in the

1066
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:29,690
community said well it's not North Korea

1067
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:32,660
but we know it was North Korea we

1068
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,130
couldn't share all the evidence and this

1069
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,390
is one of the problems because countries

1070
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:36,650
are never going to share all the

1071
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,600
evidence they have particularly if it's

1072
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,820
sensitive or classified evidence but we

1073
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,830
shared a lot of it and we need to be

1074
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,450
better at getting to attribution quicker

1075
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,130
as we were able to do in that case now

1076
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,810
apparently I heard Seth Rogen

1077
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,550
recently the noted computer forensic

1078
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:52,520
person seth rogen has now decided he

1079
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,390
doesn't think it's North Korea but we

1080
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,560
need to be able to share that

1081
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,120
information get other states to join

1082
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,150
with us and and do a more better job of

1083
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,910
creating costs on bad actors whether

1084
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,350
they be nation-states or criminals now

1085
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,480
for criminals it's easy relatively easy

1086
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,770
if you can apprehend them you put them

1087
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,300
in jail for nation-states it's a little

1088
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,160
harder but we have to use all the tools

1089
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,660
we have in our tool set everything from

1090
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,020
diplomatic tools to economic sanctions

1091
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:20,810
to law enforcement tools to cyber tools

1092
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,460
although I think cyber tools were often

1093
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,460
overrated - you know everything we have

1094
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,870
and even come up with some more tools

1095
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:28,310
working with the technical community

1096
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,710
that will actually try to punish bad

1097
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:32,510
actors and make sure that in the future

1098
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,490
they think twice about doing something

1099
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,110
that's going to cause widespread harm

1100
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,960
like like not petia for instance so I

1101
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,340
think that's something where we need to

1102
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,080
do this we also need to do this

1103
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,670
collectively I mean I think first there

1104
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,750
needs to be a better dialogue between

1105
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,670
policymakers and the technical community

1106
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,930
and figuring out what the options are

1107
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,060
but it can't just be or shouldn't just

1108
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,040
be one country acting alone if the cyber

1109
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,440
ball the flamin cyber ball of death is

1110
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,150
coming towards you every country has a

1111
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,430
right to defend itself but you're much

1112
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,780
better off if you're working with other

1113
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,440
countries and doing a more a more

1114
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,450
collective response then I think that's

1115
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,890
something we're pursuing it was

1116
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:08,660
interesting and the not petia example

1117
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,670
were Russia was named it wasn't just the

1118
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:14,270
US it was US UK a number of other

1119
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,590
countries around the world that came to

1120
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,760
that conclusion I think that's very

1121
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:22,310
helpful and then I think we also need to

1122
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,900
really figure out how we deal with some

1123
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,550
of these hybrid threats as I said the

1124
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,350
interference with our electoral systems

1125
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,850
is something we didn't see so we need to

1126
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:30,290
figure out a better way to do that and

1127
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,210
what that requires they're thinking an

1128
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:34,580
unprecedent away is a lot more

1129
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,610
cooperation began between this community

1130
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,020
and the policy community for us to

1131
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,110
understand what the what the range of

1132
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,760
options are and actually use those

1133
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,880
options and and how we can actually deal

1134
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,200
with some of the issues that are now

1135
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,780
affecting us that unanticipated threats

1136
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,970
that we hadn't seen before and really

1137
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,150
had that better connection between us

1138
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:59,570
and you know if we want if we want

1139
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,410
cyberspace to be something

1140
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,970
this not filled with threats which many

1141
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,010
people are fearing now when it doesn't

1142
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,510
break down because of the threats are

1143
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,980
out there but really continue to be the

1144
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,540
engine for growth and commerce

1145
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,520
it really is imperative that we work

1146
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,190
together and all of us are part of that

1147
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,600
solution you're part of the solution the

1148
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,130
policy community is part of the solution

1149
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,660
they shouldn't be scared of each other

1150
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,910
they should be working together you know

1151
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:23,040
I said I would tell a non-lawyer joke

1152
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,290
but a hacker joke later on this joke by

1153
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:27,240
the way he's almost as old as first but

1154
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,300
I'll still tell hackers walking down the

1155
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,060
beach he finds a lamp he rubs it and

1156
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,220
predictably enough a genie comes out and

1157
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,030
the J says look because you're a hacker

1158
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,230
there's some strings attached you get

1159
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,370
three wishes but there's some strings

1160
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:42,690
attached and that hacker says okay we're

1161
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,820
and the genie says well everything you

1162
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,410
wish for every other hacker gets twice

1163
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:49,170
as much of so the knackers I can live

1164
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,430
with that so the genie says what's your

1165
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:53,490
first wish and he goes well I want a you

1166
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,200
know I want a Cray supercomputer so he

1167
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,690
gets a crazy super computer but every

1168
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:59,640
other hacker gets a Cray supercomputer

1169
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:05,700
and you know and IBM's Watson and again

1170
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,230
this is you know hackers are competitive

1171
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:08,640
people this really bothers him because

1172
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,260
you know it doesn't it doesn't have the

1173
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,030
edge all these other hackers then jane

1174
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,140
says well what do you want next he goes

1175
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:16,140
I wanna I wanna I want a million

1176
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,240
bitcoins so we get 2 million Bitcoin but

1177
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,380
every other hacker gets 2 million

1178
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,030
bitcoins and again it really irks him

1179
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,500
and the genie says hurry up what's your

1180
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,700
third wish I want to get back to the

1181
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,750
bottle and watch I Dream of Jeannie

1182
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,930
reruns what do you want and the hacker

1183
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:29,730
pauses and he thinks about it and says

1184
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:36,150
I'd like to donate a kidney and they all

1185
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,670
don't which which tell us you and you

1186
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,080
guys all know this too and this has

1187
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,080
certainly been true in my career that

1188
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,640
the the people who are attacking our

1189
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,320
networks have become ever clever and

1190
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,910
more sophisticated yes they're still the

1191
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,350
ones who are stupid and that's great I

1192
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:51,450
used to be when I was a prosecutor I

1193
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:53,310
love stupid criminals I had a bank

1194
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:55,530
robbery case where someone came into a

1195
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:58,050
bank with with a mask gave a note to the

1196
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:01,200
teller but was wearing his nametag

1197
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,200
from from next door stupid criminals are

1198
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,850
great but we can't count on stupid

1199
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,200
criminals we can't count on stupid

1200
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,220
hackers there are many sophisticated

1201
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,240
ones and they're getting more

1202
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,260
sophisticated and you know I think we

1203
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,760
just can't also think about the threats

1204
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,089
you

1205
00:44:15,089 --> 00:44:16,829
when I talked about Colossus and and

1206
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:19,259
Colossus taking over the world well for

1207
00:44:19,259 --> 00:44:21,089
those of you who know we've ever been to

1208
00:44:21,089 --> 00:44:23,640
Bletchley Park in in the UK where they

1209
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,640
broke the enigma code and then they also

1210
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,349
broke the Lorenz Co which is a code that

1211
00:44:28,349 --> 00:44:31,109
Nazi High Command was using this is the

1212
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:33,089
original Colossus and it was used to

1213
00:44:33,089 --> 00:44:34,920
break that code so rather than computers

1214
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,450
being thought of as many people do these

1215
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:38,569
days is something that my enslave us

1216
00:44:38,569 --> 00:44:41,460
while empowering us you know this is an

1217
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,079
example of computers really doing good

1218
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:44,460
for society and we need to reinforce

1219
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,799
that instead dystopian future that all

1220
00:44:46,799 --> 00:44:49,229
these movies give us we want to have a

1221
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:51,380
more positive future so instead of

1222
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,329
Colossus and the the the future I think

1223
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:58,019
we want is not this which would be the

1224
00:44:58,019 --> 00:44:59,819
dystopian future but this and

1225
00:44:59,819 --> 00:45:00,930
unfortunately this is not a computer

1226
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:03,359
movie but having you know this is the

1227
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,619
future that we really want to have

1228
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:06,329
everyone really be able to use these

1229
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:09,329
technologies and grow these technologies

1230
00:45:09,329 --> 00:45:10,859
and this community is a core part of

1231
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:12,329
that the policy community is a core part

1232
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:14,069
of that I'm happy to have dealt with you

1233
00:45:14,069 --> 00:45:15,719
for all these years and I look forward

1234
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:17,579
to continuing to work with you in the

1235
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:19,589
future and with that I'm going to close

1236
00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:20,880
but I want to open it up to questions

1237
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,950
because I like this to be a little

1238
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:27,569
interactive to be shy I'll ask the first

1239
00:45:27,569 --> 00:45:32,160
question if you look at how much we've

1240
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:37,769
matured over over the past 30 years what

1241
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:39,680
do you think maybe the next two or three

1242
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,380
things that the community including dip

1243
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,680
the diplomatic community has to has to

1244
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,880
accomplish next I think I think part of

1245
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,329
it still this basic awareness-raising

1246
00:45:53,329 --> 00:45:56,160
and I think that that's a place the

1247
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,140
technical community I mean I often hear

1248
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,549
frustration with the technical immunity

1249
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:00,690
that the Polish community is not

1250
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:02,579
listening to them or doesn't understand

1251
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:04,529
what they're saying and so I think there

1252
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:06,690
are opportunities for now as countries

1253
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:08,489
are setting up national strategies as

1254
00:46:08,489 --> 00:46:10,109
countries are setting up diplomatic

1255
00:46:10,109 --> 00:46:11,759
teams this presents a real opportunity

1256
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:13,589
for the technical community to interact

1257
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:15,119
with them and to knock on their door if

1258
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,440
they're not locking on your door for

1259
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,450
them you do knock on their door and I

1260
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:22,079
think that the opportunities are you

1261
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,729
know to get more the other countries

1262
00:46:23,729 --> 00:46:25,289
involved yes some of the big countries

1263
00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:26,269
have been involved in these discussions

1264
00:46:26,269 --> 00:46:28,710
but it's not

1265
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,150
around the world you in a lot of

1266
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:31,470
countries are still building up their

1267
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:34,650
capabilities which is important but they

1268
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:35,970
have to be part of these conversations

1269
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:37,200
they have to be part of the stability

1270
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,550
conversation that's a part of the

1271
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:40,319
consequences conversation and the

1272
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,540
deterrence conversation it can't just be

1273
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,339
three or four big countries or even 10

1274
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:46,079
or 15 big countries it really has to be

1275
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,790
worldwide so I think this community

1276
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:49,619
especially given its spread can really

1277
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:51,960
help with that and in the countries

1278
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,490
where there's not a tradition of having

1279
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:55,470
these these structures in place really

1280
00:46:55,470 --> 00:47:04,020
help jump-start them can you hear me

1281
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,760
yeah so I'm a journalist

1282
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,680
first of all and I have a question about

1283
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,089
something that just came up recently

1284
00:47:09,089 --> 00:47:11,910
from David singers the most recent book

1285
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:15,750
and that's regarding mandiant efforts to

1286
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,119
identify apt one as a Chinese military

1287
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:21,180
operation in the book Saira describes

1288
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:25,619
mandiant investigators actually enabling

1289
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:30,780
the laptop cameras on the actors

1290
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:33,829
machines and following their keystrokes

1291
00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:35,700
presumably with the logger he doesn't

1292
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,920
specify and so the question of course is

1293
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,859
raised about a private company engaging

1294
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:43,530
in some kind of hack back activity not

1295
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,869
against a normal criminal like taking

1296
00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:48,839
over a command-and-control server but a

1297
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:51,119
nation-state actor and so I'm wondering

1298
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,319
in terms of from the Justice

1299
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,359
Department's viewpoint what are the

1300
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:56,700
legal parameters for private company

1301
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,049
engaging in something that ordinarily

1302
00:47:58,049 --> 00:47:59,400
the NSA would do because these were

1303
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,369
Chinese military computers and what are

1304
00:48:02,369 --> 00:48:03,780
they what do you consider sort of the

1305
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,490
national security implications for

1306
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:07,079
repercussions that can happen when a

1307
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:08,700
private company starts engaging in that

1308
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,650
so first let me copy up this and say I'm

1309
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:12,930
not gonna come on the mandiant case in

1310
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,730
particular and also I no longer work at

1311
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:15,930
the department justice that a long work

1312
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,670
of the government so these are not their

1313
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:20,549
views but but I'd say this more

1314
00:48:20,549 --> 00:48:21,960
generally there's been a lot of debate

1315
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,760
in the u.s. about this idea of hacking

1316
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,349
back of private companies hacking back

1317
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:27,630
and there's various quotations of this I

1318
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:28,829
mean part of it is gathering

1319
00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:30,329
intelligence especially if you've lost

1320
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:33,059
information and that's one thing if

1321
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:35,220
you're actually engaged in hacking back

1322
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,410
there are real concerns there

1323
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:38,940
and there's been some bills floated in

1324
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,610
our and our legislature about this some

1325
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:43,530
people love this idea of what they call

1326
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:45,900
letters of marque and enabling the

1327
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,120
private sector to hack back into

1328
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,340
computers in other countries the problem

1329
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,200
with that is just on a technical level

1330
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,970
and you you guys need to know this if

1331
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:56,520
you're a smart computer attacker you're

1332
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,350
not gonna come directly from your home

1333
00:48:58,350 --> 00:48:59,970
box you're gonna route it through

1334
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,290
several other boxes around the world

1335
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:02,820
that's certainly when I was investing in

1336
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,710
these cases we saw that all the time and

1337
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:06,990
so if you're trying to hack back

1338
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:08,880
especially you know not everyone in the

1339
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,560
private sector has the same capability

1340
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,940
just like not everyone in the government

1341
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,130
has the same capability if you try to

1342
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:16,140
hack back you may well end up hitting an

1343
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:21,270
innocent third party box and that you

1344
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:23,670
know that itself would be a crime a you

1345
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:25,140
also might end up doing it in the

1346
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,840
country you didn't realize say Germany

1347
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,160
for instance which would cause an

1348
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,900
international incident so I'm not fond

1349
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,730
of the idea the private sector hacking

1350
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:35,040
back I think that that's something that

1351
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,870
that is a problem now I understand the

1352
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:38,040
frustration of a lot of people in

1353
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,270
private sector who say well how do we

1354
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:40,620
protect ourselves it's a lot of things

1355
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,120
that could be done to protect to

1356
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,440
investigate that it fall short of

1357
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,790
hacking back you mentioned as one of you

1358
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:50,370
tools in your toolbox sanctions that

1359
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:52,530
sanctions are the reason that some of

1360
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:54,450
the teams that we would like to have in

1361
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,720
our community cannot attend and

1362
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:01,110
personally I feel this kind of kills our

1363
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:03,630
ability to work together in cases

1364
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:06,030
Roubini to not have a disagreement and

1365
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:07,920
actually weakens the global

1366
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,730
cybersecurity

1367
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:10,770
where are you we use on that so I mean I

1368
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:12,360
think we have to look at how we apply

1369
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,920
these tools I think the problem that

1370
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,140
we've had with sanctions if they're you

1371
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,290
know if you're gonna do deterrence right

1372
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:20,700
you have to look at each individual

1373
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:22,170
instance and you have to say what is

1374
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:23,780
actually gonna change your behavior and

1375
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,430
sometimes the sanctions I think you know

1376
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:28,020
you do broad sanctions instead a more

1377
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,150
narrow section so you know if you're

1378
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:31,950
gonna change you know the behavior of

1379
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:34,980
certain regimes the sanctions have to

1380
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,630
actually have some effect on them it's

1381
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:37,710
gonna change your behavior in the future

1382
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:39,510
so I think we need to do a more targeted

1383
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:41,970
view there look but I also understand

1384
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:43,320
your point that you know when you

1385
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,580
sanction the Heather deeds they can't

1386
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,530
travel on their

1387
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:49,910
that you know depending and depending on

1388
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:51,530
what the circumstance is it also means

1389
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:53,390
their government should be behaving more

1390
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:55,190
responsibly because sanctions are

1391
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:56,960
reversible to think about sanctions is

1392
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,870
you can reverse them and if the

1393
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:01,580
government is changing his activity it's

1394
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,230
not engaging in that then you can

1395
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:05,240
reverse those sanctions and and often

1396
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,710
the sanctions are more individually

1397
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:07,940
based and if they're individually based

1398
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:13,130
there's evidence behind them hi a lot of

1399
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:15,110
the topics brother today have been about

1400
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:18,170
hacking and remote preaches we look back

1401
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,250
at the target breach

1402
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,890
you know the HVAC system breach have you

1403
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:26,140
seen trends in increases or advances in

1404
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,400
the integration between physical and

1405
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:35,360
logical security yeah so yes because

1406
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,130
there are all sorts of worry about some

1407
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,930
of the physical breaches enable cyber

1408
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,370
breaches so there there is a remote

1409
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:41,900
breach which is one problem there's also

1410
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,580
insider breaches which is something

1411
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,960
we've been concerned about the sime

1412
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,020
close access breaches and I think that

1413
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,670
means you have to build more of an

1414
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:50,930
understanding between the people who do

1415
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:52,670
physical security and cyber security now

1416
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:54,530
I think a lot of companies that's

1417
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:56,480
happening at DHS I think they tried to

1418
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,800
combine that as well so you have a

1419
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,440
better understanding of this and even

1420
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,300
among you know and just in terms of

1421
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:05,210
cyber security different industries have

1422
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:06,920
different levels of experience and also

1423
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,230
different levels of sophistication the

1424
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:11,000
tech industry and the communications

1425
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,680
industry largely get this the financial

1426
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,120
industry it kind of gets us but a lot of

1427
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,590
the other industries manufacturing

1428
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:18,710
others have a long way to go but you do

1429
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:20,090
have to build those bridges not just

1430
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:21,140
with those industries but also

1431
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,270
understand that you know how physical

1432
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:25,460
security and cyber security interrelate

1433
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:31,670
so I totally agree Thanks yeah so this

1434
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:34,670
is a very general question when talking

1435
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:38,120
to governmental shows policy makers

1436
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,690
especially diplomats

1437
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:45,110
I have some difficulty in make them

1438
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,690
understand who is a Caesar or what is

1439
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:51,560
Caesar's yeah see surd my people are

1440
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:55,280
difficult for you know majority of

1441
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,569
diplomats so

1442
00:52:56,569 --> 00:53:03,049
can you suppose me you know how I can

1443
00:53:03,049 --> 00:53:05,970
get them to understand yeah

1444
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:08,880
well one thing I'd say is we you know in

1445
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,099
the u.s. we had my office but we also

1446
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:14,880
had diplomats all over the world in

1447
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,859
every one of our posts who had one of

1448
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:19,200
their jobs was to do cyber so they might

1449
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,609
depending on the embassy they might have

1450
00:53:20,609 --> 00:53:22,410
had several other jobs some of the

1451
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:23,759
embassies there were full-time cyber

1452
00:53:23,759 --> 00:53:25,890
people that's what they you know they

1453
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:27,960
specialized in and we trained them we

1454
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,480
brought them back to DC and we had them

1455
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,220
do regional engagement strategies

1456
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,109
brought back to DC and we had a full

1457
00:53:34,109 --> 00:53:36,390
week of training and among them we had a

1458
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:39,420
primer on how the internet worked and

1459
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,910
what cyber security was we had people

1460
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:43,829
from the certs come in and talk to them

1461
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:45,269
about what surd store and what that

1462
00:53:45,269 --> 00:53:46,859
meant to give them that level of

1463
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:48,630
education and some other countries the

1464
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,009
UK has been doing this some other

1465
00:53:50,009 --> 00:53:50,999
countries have been doing this and

1466
00:53:50,999 --> 00:53:52,349
that's really important to try to build

1467
00:53:52,349 --> 00:53:54,809
that better understanding the other

1468
00:53:54,809 --> 00:53:56,549
thing we've tried to do is to get some

1469
00:53:56,549 --> 00:53:57,900
of the diplomats together from other

1470
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,640
countries and have meetings where we

1471
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,930
talk about these issues too because

1472
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:03,150
you're right you know in the u.s. I was

1473
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:04,739
chosen to be the first one that did this

1474
00:54:04,739 --> 00:54:06,269
and some other countries it could just

1475
00:54:06,269 --> 00:54:07,829
be an ambassador came back from being

1476
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:09,960
the ambassador to you know wherever and

1477
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,460
now is charged with being the cyber

1478
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,079
ambassador and they know nothing about

1479
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:16,190
cyber so you have to educate them and

1480
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:18,450
but that's worked out pretty well I mean

1481
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:20,239
I think they're really willing to learn

1482
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:22,200
and I think Japan is a great example

1483
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,150
Japan has had a number of cyber

1484
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,430
ambassadors over the years and they come

1485
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,200
in usually not having much cyber

1486
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,730
experience but they learn very quickly

1487
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:31,200
and I think that's important so that's

1488
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,730
the other thing I think that this

1489
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:35,579
community can do is you know if you have

1490
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:37,049
someone in your government who was

1491
00:54:37,049 --> 00:54:39,480
charged with this mission go talk to

1492
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,670
them offer them some not you know don't

1493
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:43,200
yeah I wouldn't do the technical

1494
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,109
challenges with it but I would talk to

1495
00:54:46,109 --> 00:54:47,460
them about some of the basics of what

1496
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,680
you do and why it's important when they

1497
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,910
do capacity building when they're

1498
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:52,109
engaging with other countries why this

1499
00:54:52,109 --> 00:54:53,789
is a critical component that they want

1500
00:54:53,789 --> 00:54:55,380
countries to have and it I think we're

1501
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,519
making some progress on that in other

1502
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:02,029
questions

1503
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:07,090
so regarding cyber diplomacy can you

1504
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:09,300
talk about some of the verification

1505
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:13,030
efforts that are made to kind of prove

1506
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:15,130
that countries are abiding by their

1507
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:18,010
agreements yeah this is a difficult

1508
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:19,390
issue this is why you know people say

1509
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:21,400
deterrence is difficult in cyberspace

1510
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,369
because you can reach agreements people

1511
00:55:24,369 --> 00:55:25,840
can agree to do a lot of things but how

1512
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,670
do you verify especially because cyber

1513
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:31,240
tools are are things that you know could

1514
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,770
have dual use purposes they could be for

1515
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:33,910
research they could be from lushness

1516
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:36,970
purposes one of the things we we focused

1517
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:38,440
on the norms those rules the road I

1518
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,940
talked about we're not the tools

1519
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,980
themselves not saying a tool is banned

1520
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,260
but saying the effect is banned in other

1521
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:47,350
words don't use it to a critical

1522
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:50,200
infrastructure and in fact you know if a

1523
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,850
nation-state is doing that some of the

1524
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:53,380
activities we've talked about especially

1525
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:55,450
if they're doing it for a long time we

1526
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:57,100
can do attribution I mean if there are

1527
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:59,080
challenges to be sure but attribution

1528
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,430
can be made it's not just following the

1529
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:01,960
digital footprints it's looking at all

1530
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,630
the information you have motive

1531
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:06,220
intelligence everything you have and

1532
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:07,690
make that attribution it may take a

1533
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:10,210
while to do that but we can so I think

1534
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:12,190
that's the way we do verification now I

1535
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:13,540
would admit it's much more difficult

1536
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,790
than a nuclear world where you see a

1537
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,350
launch plume and you know that someone's

1538
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:19,330
done it but it's something that I think

1539
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:21,490
we have been getting better at and we

1540
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:22,810
need to make sure other countries can

1541
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:26,140
get better at - but there is still a

1542
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:27,850
sense I think among a lot of actors in

1543
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:29,859
cyberspace that it's a you know a

1544
00:56:29,859 --> 00:56:31,630
cost-free zone they can do it without

1545
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:34,180
risk of any cost being imposed because

1546
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:35,770
of this issue of attribution and

1547
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:38,020
verification I agree that verification

1548
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,400
is difficult but I just don't think it's

1549
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:45,310
impossible quick win for you sort of

1550
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:48,190
two-part principle that you alluded to

1551
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,730
about halfway through of sort of

1552
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:53,020
establishing national certs as being

1553
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,430
something like the Red Crescent or the

1554
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:57,280
Red Cross you know do no harm and that's

1555
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,680
off limits what kind of traction have

1556
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,390
you been getting and where have you been

1557
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:04,359
sort of betting that that notion yeah I

1558
00:57:04,359 --> 00:57:06,580
mean quite a bit but I think that's that

1559
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:09,010
particular norm and this is we got

1560
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:10,330
agreement at what's called the group of

1561
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:12,580
governmental experts in the UN in 2013

1562
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,080
in 2015 and that

1563
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,050
included 20 countries you know all the

1564
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:21,340
p5 members so Russia China the US UK but

1565
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:23,200
also included Germany and included a

1566
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,810
number of countries throughout the world

1567
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:27,880
endorsed that as a norm and I think it's

1568
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,290
getting a lot of traction but I think

1569
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:30,610
this is where this community could be

1570
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:32,830
really valuable is to say why that's an

1571
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:35,530
important norm and and again work with

1572
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:37,090
the policymakers in your country to get

1573
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:39,010
more widespread application of that

1574
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:41,110
because I think that is something that I

1575
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:44,080
think is an important one to observe I

1576
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,660
think people understand it you know at a

1577
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,520
visceral level pretty easily and so I

1578
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,840
think that's something I'd like to see

1579
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,610
more traction on there has been traction

1580
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:56,620
though yeah follow on some national

1581
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,840
certs are having a different

1582
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,790
configuration with regard to national

1583
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:03,730
security agencies than others how would

1584
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,910
that factor into this more so I think

1585
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:08,740
even some of the early certs were set up

1586
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:10,690
in national security agencies and

1587
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:13,780
defense agencies you know the the issue

1588
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:16,240
here is their mission has to be one of

1589
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,490
defensive purposes and they can be

1590
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:19,780
defensive purposes even in those

1591
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:22,180
agencies and not offensive purposes so

1592
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:25,030
so I think it's it's the the research

1593
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:26,800
should be used for good doesn't mean

1594
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,000
countries can't have offensive

1595
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,960
capabilities because they're all

1596
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,430
developing them but that's really

1597
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:33,550
somewhere else we have time for one more

1598
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:34,330
question

1599
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:36,360
hello I used to work in law enforcement

1600
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,040
both as well in the UK and one of the

1601
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,110
biggest problems we had was getting

1602
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:42,910
evidence quickly from different

1603
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:45,460
countries so I think the question is in

1604
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,230
two parts in part of the conversations

1605
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:49,900
that you've had and heard in these cross

1606
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,910
country collaborations has there been a

1607
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:55,510
component around ensuring some of the

1608
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:57,900
big corporates and the big social media

1609
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,250
or the big companies you have logs who

1610
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,840
have evidence providing more quickly

1611
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,970
yeah

1612
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:07,180
is there more kind of expanding in those

1613
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:08,710
departments because when you when you'd

1614
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:10,930
send it up to the law enforcement it go

1615
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:12,280
across wasn't it to the country and down

1616
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,930
again then up and then down again and

1617
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:16,570
that could take about two years and has

1618
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:17,980
there been any kind of improvement in

1619
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,740
that time frame

1620
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:22,109
yeah this is one of the the big problems

1621
00:59:22,109 --> 00:59:23,490
when I was a justice but it continues to

1622
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:24,030
this day

1623
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:25,859
and there are two things we've done to

1624
00:59:25,859 --> 00:59:28,260
address it one is this 24/7 network I

1625
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,910
mentioned that was started within the g8

1626
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:32,369
but now is over 60 countries that that's

1627
00:59:32,369 --> 00:59:34,550
supposed to provide what's called a fast

1628
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:37,500
free slow thaw sort of things so you

1629
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,000
make sure the evidence is still there

1630
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,200
because you guys all know the evidence

1631
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,609
could disappear really quickly and

1632
00:59:41,609 --> 00:59:42,570
especially if you have to go back

1633
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:45,300
several hops I could disappear so make

1634
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,980
sure the evidence is there quote really

1635
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:48,990
quick cooperation among countries you

1636
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:52,320
can call this 24/7 network which as its

1637
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,660
name implies it operates 24/7 so you can

1638
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,310
get that evidence frozen and then use

1639
00:59:56,310 --> 00:59:57,780
whatever legal process you'd go further

1640
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:59,700
so that solves part of it doesn't solve

1641
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,920
all but the other problem is the issue

1642
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,180
of getting evidence a lot of the

1643
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:04,560
evidence is now in the u.s. that's gonna

1644
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,599
change over time because you know cloud

1645
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:07,859
services and other things going to be

1646
01:00:07,859 --> 01:00:10,080
based other places there was a recent

1647
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,700
you know when I was at the White House

1648
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:15,060
and and a state we worked to try to

1649
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:17,010
negotiate some agreements of where we

1650
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:18,900
needed a law in place that allowed

1651
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,300
easier access of evidence between

1652
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,010
countries so the UK was the first

1653
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:25,770
country that opposed that that proposed

1654
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:27,450
this for the US and we negotiated that

1655
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:29,730
with the UK or started to and they just

1656
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:31,380
recently in the u.s. passed the cloud

1657
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:34,170
act it's called which allow companies to

1658
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:36,390
share information with other governments

1659
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:38,730
and with within particular circumstances

1660
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:40,530
and you have to have an agreement to do

1661
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:43,230
that and one of the key things is having

1662
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:46,440
you know due process rule of law but it

1663
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,210
allows a much quicker access between

1664
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:50,040
countries and one of the reasons that's

1665
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,599
important this you have there's many

1666
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:52,710
reasons it's important the first it's

1667
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:54,330
important for solving law enforcement

1668
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:56,040
cases but it's also important because

1669
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,349
countries would say look you know

1670
01:00:58,349 --> 01:01:00,119
because it's so hard to get the data

1671
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:01,589
from you we're going to force your

1672
01:01:01,589 --> 01:01:03,060
companies to have data here we're gonna

1673
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,680
do data localization which we think is

1674
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:08,460
bad for lots of different reasons or it

1675
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,020
can mean it and create an adversarial

1676
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:11,339
relationship that we really didn't need

1677
01:01:11,339 --> 01:01:12,390
with those countries who want to have

1678
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:13,980
more of a cooperative relationship so

1679
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,470
this cloud act I think is important the

1680
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:18,240
one thing I'd say it enables this the

1681
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,320
one thing I'd say is now we have to

1682
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,460
reach agreements with each of those

1683
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:22,890
countries so the US does to enable that

1684
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:24,570
to actually work that's going to take

1685
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:26,520
time but I think it's an important

1686
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,650
development and there's also some

1687
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:30,270
efforts like the internet and

1688
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:33,500
there's a group called the internet

1689
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,430
jurisdiction project which is doing a

1690
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:36,780
lot of good work this a lot of work in

1691
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:40,200
this area I want to thank all of you

1692
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,630
that's my if anyone's interested in

1693
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:44,580
following movie posters the hackers

1694
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:47,280
computers that's my Twitter handle I'm

1695
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,740
at 33 now I'm hoping to get to at least

1696
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:52,950
52 but if you have any ideas for one so

1697
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:54,300
they haven't hit feel free to

1698
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,020
suggestions

1699
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,860
thanks Chris

1700
01:02:01,829 --> 01:02:03,890
